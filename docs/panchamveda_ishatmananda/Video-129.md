[130: Panchama Veda 130 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqUPNUvU0I)

good evening let us begin this talk the gospel of Saddam Athena when gem Aveda with this prana mantra Toluca Tom rhythm dr. jay burnham kobe vide rhythm calm asha boham sermon among golem srimad artem boobie gun and de bourree da Jana Saddam Krishna is to love cash option last time and we are studying this particular chapter where master Masha has mentioned last visit to Asia and they refine the wonderful behavior of ceramic is not his to love a chef Jenn Dechaine so much dope Keisha was not his followers rather - of philosophy was totally different in many ways with Ramakrishna he was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj he had his own followers who many of them were not very happy with ceramic isness attitude or approaches to god even then salam o krishna is to visit Keisha naturally we may think why the genuine love for God was the reason Keisha had a genuine love a real love a sincere effort to reach to God see Ramakrishna the God incarnate what was a ver Eger to help those who were sincere in the pursuit of God Sri Ramakrishna was eager to go to everyone why because he wanted to see the people are perfect in the attitude in them as a partial to God with the realization of God and we in the bhagavad-gita we find that the Sri Krishna also is mentioning ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva Bahama Mama Bartman Overton de manushya bars are Basha this is the uniqueness cinema Krishna once say to his disciples freedom from any vegan under he who was Rama he who was Krishna and when he find that how the beautiful way he is not telling anything but his behavior that speaks and that is supporting the scripture the Gita as the Krishna he said this waver in whatever way following the path of God they are coming to me whosoever worship me through whatsoever that I verily accept and bless them in that way mean everywhere follow my path and that is the beauty that is the speciality we were there all coming to God see Ramakrishna is reaching out to them helping them so why I give so much of importance wide all things our senior Swami's gave so much of importance in reading the book this gospel there is a Shawnee was the very erudite scholar in bed under the schwa me in the beginning of his life is to read only gospel that one of his this disciple extreme Swami used to read the scripture with on the who punishes drama shooter now you don't read that you reading only gospel the most of the people they think gospel is a simple thing the conversation are not then he said he was the president of the Ramakrishna order he said now I understand gospel is truth in a spiritual type gospel of ceramic isne Kadam Rita is the truth if there is any controversy between the Upanishads and the Quran Rita I will activate umbral why here the person who has realized he is behaving accordingly this is the importance the most of the people they talk about began Thawee go to attain the Vedanta we go to attain this class that class but those who were really sincere they should read these and some of our simia swami used to say you better read be waken and the vast understand him they encounter gospel you don't think that it is so simple when cinema krishna he is going to cash option regime the description if you read in five minutes you can complete the reading because nothing is there in the description but if you read in between the lines and go in depth of create then he will understand why see Ramakrishna the first question will come into your mind Saddam Oh Krishna was not a Brahma he was a Hindu he was a image worshipper and which exactly opposite to Kesha but he is visiting Keyshia and helping him and here he finds his ram krishna came to see Keyshia who was very ill suffering but he neighbor asked him how are you what are the medicines we were taking who are the doctors attending you neighbor about that immediately after entering into a his house he started talking about God and very high philosophy while uplifting the mind from the body and that is the real work of the Guru it's not socializing it's not going and just talking with him oh how are you I'm so sorry you're better you talk to that doctor this doctor nothing like that he understood he is going to give up this body not many days are left and he was giving him if mentally uplifted to the spirituality so that is as we always pray assertive moths at gamma young Thomas Omar Joe Teague amyum he was lifting his mind from the body to the soul and it is like from the impermanent to the eternal the body is impermanent temporary but the soul the God the Brahman is permanent eternal so see Ramakrishna was talking about that his mind he was lifting and moreover he was giving wonderful idea taking his mind from the darkness to the light here we find in the page 322 of the gospel of C Ramakrishna he is mentioning is asking a question to Keisha - Keisha with a smile why is it that you are healed and then the next para I am not reading to all the lines in the next better I find he is giving the reply and with an example as his aunt that was his speciality his uniqueness always to give a small small example so that he can understand what he meant easterly and elephant entering her heart creates havoc within and ultimately shakes it down an elephant entering a heart creates havoc within and ultimately it down the hint is their shake sit down that means Keisha only leaving for a long time so check sit down he said the elephant of divine emotion enters the heart of this body and shattered heed to pieces so that is why he is telling and he said the fire of knowledge at first destroy such enemies of spiritual life as passion anger and so forth look at it the people they are following the path of religion they think we are following the path of religion they do so many things they'll be fasting they'll be donating to the visiting the holy places they'll be listening the reading but how to know that I am really proceeding towards the path of God or towards God however know the Dhamma Krishna here that is the reason I always think that is a Pentium of ADA it gives knowledge and spiritual knowledge it says that the fire of knowledge at first destroys such any means of spiritual life as passion anger and so forth Gama Asia crudo Asia rajo-guna sahaja Maharana ma pop ma beginner Hawaii be down you say Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita again so when we read like these we understand when Saddam Krishna said he who was Rama V who as Krishna in this life in this body and that is so true in every step is whatever he said in the bhagavad-gita he is practicing doing it ramakrishna and here we find he is telling the karma and grow the passion and anger are destroyed then what women only the soul only the God and nothing else Gamow Eva crew the Isha when the passion is their desire is there and when that is not fulfilled naturally the anger comes so this two goes side by side hand in hand and that is the reason one person should constantly try to understand whether my desires my passions are listening listening listening or not and when my passions and my desires suppose I am having something is not there whether there is anger the closer does the expression of the failure passion that he said and lastly a violent commotion and then again he said then comes the turn of ego first is passion then anger and ultimately the ego is completely crashed then the man is ready to receive God so these are the two three small small things as deep very small very ordinary but that is the hint of the progressive spiritual life how he will judge a holy man like this if the man is having the cravings the desires the passions and also at the same time he is his anger and then his ego is present when all these three are not there is holy man so then it says lastly a violent commotion it's seen in the physical frame is in the physical frame that is coming why it is that it's a thinking in this way the body is the result of our karma therefore as long as body is their ignorance of ganna remain a Shankracharya in his explanation to the fourth Sutra of the brahma sutra maybe we will read some debris Majoris he said the thought to someone I odd that means because the knowledge of Brahman become prevalent in mind body consciousness become insignificant and Saddam o Krishna is telling in a different way first when that knowledge is entering what he does he burns the passion and the anger then crashes the ego and then finally it breaks the whole body the frame within which the self is bound as I I am this body consequently we are thinking the moment I say I it mind comes over to this body so it says like this so ceramic isne is going on talking Teesha understanding it left again and again by master illusion in the hospital you are selling if you are in the hospital the doctor will never leave you till you are cure so similarly things you have come to the place of God you have started taking the name of God you started praying the God will never leave you till you realize God till you realize is God you will never leave you as a patient enters into the hospital never gets the the from the doctor the release order that you can go till the doctor is here that he is cured Keshav is laughing the in case of is telling all depends on God's will today the subject is that all depends on God's will just the approach of the devotee a chef is a Brahma biani the Brahma gana the Brahmin but he shoves Brahman that is a conception of saguna brahman again so unless you have the background of the philosophy it is very difficult to understand the ring he said all these gods will how come Abram of Gani talking about the God here the brahman is Saguna Brahma who is nothing but the Ishwara the Brahman the pure consciousness cannot create so it is reflected on the Maya and then it is creating that is called sua guna Brahma and that is the other name of that is Ishwara etcetera etcetera we have already discussed before so this is Saguna burn Brahma and see Ramakrishna mentioned about this and he said in order to take full advantage of the do the gardener removes the soil from the for the bah-bah sir rose down to the very root the special type of rose is there and it says if you are opening that particular ground it goes to the root it can see then the dew drop it reaches to the root and the best flower it comes the rose the plant thrives better on account of the moisture perhaps that is why you two are being shaken to the very root the root is ego you too are shaken to the very root that means your ego is completely crushed and when ego is not there as we were mentioning that to someone they are then on which the mind will be I the feeling is not there completely the consciousness constantly the feeling of the body is completely gone so I consciousness gone then what will remain Dow you and that is the ultimate and the best flower that means the human life is really successful when he understands she understands that is nothing about the manifestation of God so here is a llama business giving perhaps that is why you two are being shaken to the very root case of an master a laughing master moshai he noticed that others could not understand this cliche understood this of knew that his days are numbered he is going to go to be but he is not afraid at all that he is going to die that is the speciality when one assured that he has realized God then there is no fear of I am that is the main thing there fun avoid that if that is coming there's no fear sir Babu the issue everything because in everything I see my own self and here the key chef and master are laughing it may be that you will do tremendous thing when you come back down okay systole may be next life you have to come again not that you will be realized completely it will go back and margin the sources not that that hint is also there it will do a great thing when you come back again next time as because you are reaching to the very high whenever I didn't this time cinema Krishna is giving very clearly we never I hear that you will yield I become extremely restless after hearing of your last illness I used to wink to the divine mother in the small hours of the morning I pray it to her Oh mother if anything happens to cushaw with whom then shall I talk in Calcutta this is the thing sometimes some people their thoughts their manners their behaviors are so many worldly the minds are so crooked they cannot think straight way is better to avoid their company though according to the Vedanta each soul is potentially divine but at the same time some people are so bad type of thoughts appear whom sometimes people think about the sinful thoughts why sinful thoughts because hurting others criticizing others feeling ill for others constantly thinking in that way so their manners their thoughts and what he was BR that is the moment you go near them that enrich your mind pollute your mind influence of mine so better to avoid see Ramakrishna do you as God himself he was an avatar of Arista and his work was no mission was to reach out to people to help them to manifest the divinity even then he was killing it is better to have some people with whom I can go and talk who are really lovers of God who really likes God they are open-minded straight so that's why he is telling I used to feel sad whenever I heard about the illness of yours okay so I used to pray to bother the distant is here I told coming to Calcutta I offered fruits and switch to the divine mother with the prayers for your well-being the devotees were deeply touched to hear ceramic Krishna's love for Keyshia and is longing for the Brahma leader all the devotees were there honesty Ramakrishna's followers one or two like the master Mushin but mostly they were the followers of corruption the same so obviously when the see Ramakrishna was telling that I pray they were very happy but Saddam additional spraying not to impress them he was praying for the genuine devotee so that is the attitude of a religious man no difference whether you follow my path or not my god or not my philosophy or not it does not matter at all if you are sings here so obviously the religious minded person the broad-minded person who has who is having some experience about the god like seal goes to you this is the see Ramakrishna the devotees were very happy then the master second he say how they see he is the Ishwara he's the god he knew everything we know the definition of God who knows the past present and the future one of the the quality of God is this cinema Krishna is mentioning to K shop not directly but sufficient clear in his beer I used to pray for you then he say but this time to tell the truth I didn't feel anxious to that extent because you are sure the case will die Kashyap will not be there so because of know he was praying to mother mother will never reply never I will never give that okay since we're playing not like that so he knew what is going to happen he came and he never asked about the ill health and anything he was constantly helping his mind to soar on high and to travel on the higher plane so he is telling but this time to tell you the truth I didn't feel anxious to that extent Teesha mother came ma not a gentleman say aloud to the master said here is mother saluting you mother of this generation now you just think about the situation the scene sadhana Krishna has come to see the case of gender Shane we think now the ketchups mother she is entering into that room and praying to see Ramakrishna house Adama Krishna is answering sadhana Krishna smiled uma not again mother ask you to bless kishore that he may be cured of his illness which is very natural mother is asking the Ramakrishna's blessing Cyrano kishna to keep shops mother please pray to the divine mother who is the best tour of all bliss she will take care of your trouble sonication is not telling she will make you son all right she will take care of your trouble so if we read every word is so perfect because he knew what is going to happen and that is the reason and he was not sorry why she was not Creole for Keisha why because he knew the crusher will come back once again and he will do lot of God's work afterwards and whatever the spiritual development that he has done in this life that will be utilized in the next life everything he knows just like a picture so he is not part of at all this is called Rishi attitude the Rishi's as because they knew everything what is going to happen in the afterwards so they are not part of it all so that is exactly in the form of siddhaloka snah he said please pray to divine mother who he is the best or of all please the mother should not be unhappy should not feel sorry or cry or naturally the such a son like Keisha died and the must still the mother is early mother is leaving so that naturally people can think what will happen to our the best tour of please she will give you joy she will give you a mind a tranquility so he said that she will take away your troubles to Keesha we could create the seriousness to cash of now Sudama Trishna sterling don't spend long hours in the inner apartments you know the olden days there is a outer apartment and inner apartment out of the extra people from outside is to come and meet and the inner apartments are totally different from that they don't spend their much time you will feel better if you hear only talk of God the before the birth and before the death one should concentrate on God the mother when she is pregnant if she goes on listening to the God's words with the holy book sing prayer son will be very good we were the child the baby will surely have a good marks of the spirituality that sure that happens that is why in ancient time these two always take care of the would-be mother and this - always ask them to seat properly and then listen to God and the pray to God the mind will be constantly on that and it reaches into that baby enough before date also if one is going on praying to God the mind is above that body consciousness is also good the master say to Keesha the master arted these words in his various voice and then began to laugh like a boy the psychological treatment that we need here Hausa Ramakrishna is treating the psychologically the first he is telling his mother his brother is as family and his devotees explains he'll give the him that this is the final time for the Keisha and all then afterwards he is telling it is of no use taking this body because when the elephant comes it breaks like that so in the god the thought has come it goes then he said to Kish off now few days are left don't spend time over there thinking of the worldly things of the property and the family keep your mind constantly in touch with God so that is the real thing and that is the reason Ramakrishna was so clear he understood ke Shivani will understand this and he was telling it to directly to keshavjee she understood it and immediately afterwards the people should not say that what she is telling to him why these immediately just - so that is the way the god the world immediately behaving in such a way people are deluded he said he laughed like a boy and he said to ketchup let me see your hand he took the hand he will eat playfully like a child he is not watching the palm or reading the bomb he was weighing the hand usually some business to do many other references are also there he used to weigh the hand and that afterwards is to say he and he said no your hand is light hypocrites have heavy hands now don't try to weigh your hand organ so it's very difficult is called some of the Vidya only very very special type of people can understand these otherwise will always make a mistake some Arabic there the physical things they can understand they can say he weighed the hand from the elbow to that palm and then he is to say the weather is good or be easily that if they were bad he never remarked anything he didn't say anything but about the Kaiser he said your hand is light and you are not a hypocrite most of the people in the philosophical path particularly in the spiritual path they become hypocrites why is so difficult to continue the high moral values and then model is nothing much above the morality spirituality that spiritual that keeping the mind so obviously they try then they afterwards they can't continue then we become hypocrites because there is no way for them to go back so most of the people they become integrates Xiaomi be weak man sometimes it is really terrified because people who are trying to realize God for them there is a caution he said those who are practicing religion or trying to realize God they are very few even among that as a percentage he is killing a tea person become hypocrite fifteen percent go man five person genuinely trying so that is the spirituality and realization of God it's not a just a matter of joke then we just see it and then we understand how I have understood not like that so one plus one equal to two not like that this is a completely different thing as Salam o Krishna hinted the if the God is entering into your art then three things will happen first passion anger ego will be burnt to ashes do not press of passion no trace of ego and no trace of anger but the anger when you are living in the world you have to show otherwise you cannot survive so the practical training is also there and he is killing here one up against a to the master from the door that he's announcing in those days the women their neighbor is to talk directly with any man though she was very elderly even then in the mass elderly they be also seems to converse with certain and the G and others through somebody else so here monastic mother asked you to bless ketchup ketchups mother is requesting once again now here master and the recorder three more within the bracket mentioned gravely he said what can I do God alone this is all he is not grazing he knew that this body will never remain and there is no hypocrisy okay okay I am blessing he never said like that only bow what is dying work main only call it dares then he is giving again as he is on he is explained God loves on two occasions he loves when two brothers divide the land between them they put a string across the land and say to each other this side his mind that side is yours God laugh and feed himself why this whole universe is mine and about a little cloth they say this side is nine and their side is yours and God loves again when the physician says to the mother weeping bitterly because of a child's desperate illness don't be afraid mother I shall cure your child that is not possible the physician does not know that no one can save the child if God wills that he should died so the that is why the cash option Dushane understanding these he said all depends on God's will and this exactly what the Dom occasion he was giving very clear hint that this time is not grain for Bishop and this time he is not going to bless just then tisha was seized with the feet up coughing which lasted for a long time the sight of his suffering made everyone said then some refreshment had arranged for the master key shops eldest son who was seated near him the master see of omelet the another person introduced the boy and requested see Ramakrishna to bless him then see Ramakrishna say it is not given to me to bless anyone he's the god now if he says something it is going to happen so that's why as when he is there he cannot change the course of the karma voila the God says another speaker stated pop on Nutella basu brew tombliboo in the bhagavad-gita very clearly again the Sri Krishna is mentioning I don't place anyone I don't curse anyone to another they coasted papa achieve a Sukkah thumb booboo again mean because of their ignorance whatever the Karma that you have done accordingly you are suffering or enjoying don't blame me I am only watching that's all but if you create to God again and again is sincerely then the pain will be reduced that is the thing see Ramakrishna is telling that it is not given to me to bless anyone and with a sweet smile he stroked the boy's body gently but he was indirectly blessing the boy by touching how many total smiles alright then do as you please with earth the omelet was very close to say Ramakrishna he knew his ways he said master to the devotee I cannot say such a thing as may you be healed I never asked the divine mother to give me the power of healing I prayed to her only Beulah so this is exactly what a man should pray to God give me the power so that I can become these and the many people they follow particularly a group of people are there and sometimes people they misunderstand them thinking they are tantrikas and practicing only for their spiritual power miraculous power but it's not like that anyone anyway if he someone is doing that is a separate but one should only ask God for pure love now next month in the main Shami kabab Anand is coming from Toronto to give a retreat in our Ganges on Nadia bhakti shooter that is pure love then how this love and how to inculcate what happened so he'll be explaining in that way then he is telling to people is cash of a small person he is respected by all seekers after wealth as well as holy men so that is the traditional way of the Hindus long long back spiritual growth not only spiritual but also the worldly both they were there so that is the reason the balance was there and he said both could come and pray to him he had the power once I visited dhyanam then in the shalour city the founder of the arya samaj he was a great person who was being staying at the Golden House of sorry garden house I saw he was extremely anxious about key shops coming he went out every few minutes to see whether he had arrived I learned latter on that issue had made an appointment with him that day Keisha I understood had no faith in the sacrifices and the date he is mentioned in the wages referring to these they are on the side why God has created so many things could he not make deities as well though he himself then under Celestia T the founder of the Arya Samaj he was only practicing without any images only pure Veda and mostly the Karma Yoga and young Ganz all that though they were having the differences of opinion philosophical differences both where sincere seeker of God there is no difference so obviously Salaam o Krishna is appreciating both they are on the philosophy and also ketchup chunder Shan look at these a person like Granada is waiting for Keyshia do you think it is so simple so continuing the master said cassia is free from the pride of a small-minded religious teacher to many people he has seen if you have any doubts go there there means to see Ramakrishna to have them solved so naturally the narrow-minded people always like to say be with me only listen to me only follow my words only but Keyshia was not like that he was asking his disciple people whose to come to him you can go to see Ramakrishna have any doubt why he knew the realization is with Ramakrishna intellectually they are trying to understand God and proceeding but the true knowledge realization was Ramakrishna so I better go it is my way to say what shall I do with people's respect let - UPS virtue increase a millionfold salam addition is a god he never wanted to have the praise of the gob people he said rather people let people praise the km me his virtue increasing million for Bishop is certainly a great man everyone respect him seekers of the wealth as well as the holy men thus the Ramakrishna be praised Grisha then afterwards he was coming down now you see how things goes immediately he noticed the brahma devotees accompanied him to the cab which was standing in the street while coming down the stairs the master noticed that there was no light on the ground floor he said 200 and the case of other disciples this place's should be well lighted a house without light becomes stricken with poverty a house without light should not be there because that is a sign of poverty please see that it does not happen again this is the way that God teaches you must always still lighted happy clean so that's why the mind of the people also become happy when you enter into a shabby dark place your minds also comes down and become like that if your light it plays beautifully decorated and clean when you go your mind is also lifted so that is the reason he was mentioning on his way to the finisher from he shoves cottage see Ramakrishna stopped at joy Gopal same house see how the missionary war sasame krishna started what we do now it was introduced by the Grantham Krishna himself the most of the ancient time the religious people never visited any devotees house but see Ramakrishna is to go is to sit over there and naturally they used to call different people around from the neighborhood and used to talk with them and then again to another then they came to another one day he has visited two three people and constantly talking with David it's all very very a person like him it was so much but even then he used to do and he said he went over there it was seven o'clock in the evening in the drying room Jericho Falls relatives the neighbors had gathered by Kunta not by concur the joy couple's brother say to master said we are worldly people please give us some advice most of the time when you are reading the gospel you find the same type of question asking Saddam oh gosh no this time you say do your duty to the world after knowing God with one hand hold to the lotus feet of God Lord and with the other do your work the very clear question and complete clear answer sir we are worldly people please give her some advice what the we should do he said do your duty to the world that means whatever the responsibilities were having after knowing God does it mean after realization of God know after knowing that God is there that supreme being is there so after believing that knowing that keeping in your mind you work how with one hand hold to the lotus feet of the Lord with the faith the God is there then if you are working in the world you won't be bound by that that is the idea and with the other do your work then the same person is asking is the world unreal he knows but asking the ceramic Krishna's answer is unique he immediately say yes it is unreal look at it we have already then the Sunday those who have attained at this hour Sunday the talk we were discussing about the Buddhism again and again the fast lines the fast teaching of all the main four teachings of the Buddha is juddered this come on the whole world is full of misery Shankar Acharya also said this world is mixture is completely unreal but Solano Krishna that is why he is so special the Salam o Krishna is telling yes it is unreal as long as one has not realized God as long as one has not realized God then it is with one hand that is unridden delivered through ignorance man forgets God and speaks always I and mine he sings down and down entangled in Maya deluded by desires Maya Rob's him of his knowledge to such an extent that he cannot find the way of scape though such a way exists not that they Ramakrishna is doing against the idea of the bootmgr Shankara but he is putting it in it in his own way in a devotional path when you are following the path of devotion is all God manifested everywhere so Bhagavan would he was following the path of knowledge we must remember that the path of knowledge sometimes we will be discussing about Shankara and his parama guru shankara's gurus guru he says this world is never there and Shankara says it is unreal etcetera Buddha also said it is there but full of misery you have to go beyond that Ramakrishna is telling from the path from the viewpoint of bhakti from the viewpoint of devotion it is created by God God has entered into it God is manifesting in everything so unless and until you have realized God you may think that this is mikta this is unreal but when you realize God you see the same God everywhere in everything yesterday yesterday next robbery cut cut the Krishna's today those who were the followers of Krishna they see Krishna everywhere that he is telling it is unreal as long and what one has not realized God then you all know from your experience how in Barban in the world is each and every one from the experience that we know then he is giving a song and he is telling the Shankar Acharya is telling what is this world Satya Anita Moulton agree this is I my notes see Ramakrishna was telling look at this way how many people had come into this world and again passed away so it is so temporary so unreal Shankar Acharya mentioned these such theory that is permanent unreserve assert here that is temporary we tuned it they mixed here this world is true at the same time untrue why because when we are ignorant we are accepting this world as true and when the knowledge comes we think this is total untrue when we were young the football and the games and all those things would so much true to us the Chi flying the slides guides and all and now at this age it has no value so obviously truth and untruth those who have understood it it is completely untrue those who have not yet so secure Anita mixed maternity cinema Krishna also said Genie table et is a sugarless their stand is their mixed if you can really utilize this life is sweet if you cannot is very very difficult to leave and he said this kind of world is usually and impermanent in every screen why said should one whole to God with one hand and to the world with the other why should one even stretch out one hand to hold to the world if it is impermanent only for the argument they're asking we will not do nothing in both the hands they are holding the world only but still he is mentioning in such a way if it is impermanent then why not hold the God you need not to hold in that way when you really understand this world is impermanent so both the hands will automatically will go to God you need to ask this question the master is killing the world is not impermanent if one leaves there after knowing God the consistency of his teaching why he is not talking to the people who are following the path of knowledge is talking to the devotees and if you say the world is mikta is totally temporary it is totally illusion there will be a lot of confusion so there is the reason see Ramakrishna is always handling the people according to it two deer stand again and again he's telling that this world is not impermanent it is permanent if one leaves there after knowing God when you know God that means God who has created this universe is also present in the universe I see everything nothing but God and jagat this universe according to Buddha it is full of misery dukkha mine according to shankar it is mithya but according to see Ramakrishna disappear it is true if you realize God so we should not mix up the knowledge and devotion so this is the way and immediately to make the point clear as you used to tell the stories and actors is to sing also through the song used to make whole thing very clear so I will get up to today we will close over here the friends this is the real thing that we have to understand us because I have seen many of you are so strict here for such a long time you are associated with this idea now life is writen and we must be very very sincere instead of going here and being and wasting our time reading this book and that book and getting different type of ideologies and ideas it there is no time left we have to concentrate now so the younger people is okay let them go and have the testing different but we have to concentrate now time is short those who are really sincere in any path how we have to if we are following the path of bhakti most of us are devotees the clearer and clearer and clearer and sasame Krishna will find that he is telling taking the name of God is puja the worship that we are doing only by taking the name of God that will be sufficient and we have seen in this gospel he's mentioning the Temasek rajasic swapped ik and beyond such WA the Tama see he is making the offering to God with killing the animals according to that so that he can eat that type of thing rajasic is also cooking in a great fashion and cooking for God I am giving in all this logic and he'll be going on telling people I had cooked for God although the offering that you see I have cooked and that is like that they'll be telling like that yeah they have the devotion but at the same time la Torre go into that sucked ik quietly will do but still that is a limitation beyond that God's name is Buju we have to reach to that taking the name of God does it constantly with a complete faith the God in some said if you take the name of God you are doing worship I need not to go to Temple and see it or to any other place and offer like this if we can is okay if he cannot no problem so that level should be so Saddam Oh Krishna is mentioning and through corruption regime the way he is behaving with the ketchup that way he is also indicating us giving the in to us this body is temporary but as long as it is there utilize it how by taking the name of God and nothing else that's all all this argument and grief filosophy and these that all intellectual journalism that's nothing but the main is the peace happiness tranquility realization and joy and how you will understand that three thing will happen what are the three things fast the desire and big last second anger will be abolished third does we know ego only that time the heart will be ready to receive God it is Preto Salama busines that one day we should have that and let us offer our pranaam to him Nealon Jinnah medium onon the roopam popped on gumpa recipe from Bowie Aisha Dharam tada Misha medium Tom Ramakrishna sheet asana
