the guitar rhythm dr. jay burnham kuvira Tom kulbhushan Savannah Mangalam srimad Artem Vivekananda a broody dodging aha sai Ram Krishna and 3ma they were discussing about the cash option regime and this type of words like ketchup at one time thought a great deal of Christianity rishabh now believe in Kali the embodiment of spirit and consciousness the primal energy now within a few days there will be Kali Puja in just one sentence ram krishna is mentioning what is actually Kali this Kali is the embodiment of spirit and consciousness the consciousness it goes to usually we say as a Brahmin so Callie is also Brahman as because she is also consciousness then the primal energy the consciousness at the same time the energy the working capacity he repeats the holy name of the mother this is the wonderful way a system that has been developed in the Hindu religion that if you repeat the name of god or goddess particularly serum krishna he was worshipping goddess kali and that particular name of the mother it became so powerful and slowly the keshavjee under Shan when he came in contact with Ramakrishna in the beginning he was the output about the Hinduism he worked out pull about the Hindu Zooey's and he was going towards the Christianity many of the then those time the people they converted themselves into Christianity because they were confused about the Hinduism it was not very clear and that is the reason ceramic Asian of the God himself he came and he was tab listing establishing this Hinduism and here he started by worshipping the goddess Kali that is the primal energy the power which is there within our heart within every human being only if we can repeat that name all the bondages will go away so this wonderful system of repeating the name of Goddess is introduced then the master ma she was telling the soil of this country is different only what is true survives here the master ma che he was telling about the truth and Serano Krishna says yes that is so the Channahon adharma the eternal religion declared by the Rishi's will alone endure here he mentions about the sanatana dharma that we were reading the last time there's another and our ma the what is this not on a Dharma the Sanskrit word sanatana means eternal and the Dharma means righteousness the eternal cosmic order mentioned this thing was mentioned sanatana dharma mentioned in the manu smriti and the bhagavata the sanatana dharma is a process of spiritual development based on the Vedic revelation we have to understand two thing whatever we see we find we touch we can smell within all this fighting that we are having within that whatever is there we think that is the only thing that is a mistake that is exactly what the Rishi's they are telling beyond that also behind that also there are many other things and that is the consciousness is present it is there pedant means going breaking they say all these bondages the bondage of this fight they are constantly dragging us down our mind to these worldly things which are temporary and here see ramakrishna is mentioning sanatana dharma immediately said what the Rishi's dimension the eternal religion declared by the Rishi's Rishi's at the seers they revealed the sword the experience then only they were propagating they were telling this is the thing that happened and the other thing that is our intellectual many many the thoughts that came the movement that came so that was all intellectual that which has come through revelation through realization that is the truth the master moshai he was mentioning in this country on this soil that means in the india only truth is accepted it survives and nothing else and see ramakrishna he is supporting that telling this is the eternal religion that will alone india because there's the truth whether you accept it or not whether you believe it or not whether you like it or not this is the truth and it is going to happen show me be waken under he is mentioning before the the discovery of the law of gravitation law of gravitation was there the force of gravitation was there if all the human kind of forget about this it will be there this is the truth similarly the human being is nothing but the divine all being and nothing but the divine that is the truth and that truth was revealed to the Rishi's and that they were mentioning there are two things that there one is the consciousness another the same consciousness active creating sustaining preserving destroying that activity these are the two things constantly going on doing and we come to this and that is this truth revelation is destroyed understanding this truth reaching to this conclusion that is called sanatana dharma it has nothing to do with any narrow sense this is the process that makes a glutton to man man unto God as sharmaji is telling Saturday January 5th 1884 we are starting from page number three seven eight of the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna it was the 23rd day of him stay with Sri Ramakrishna master mascha he was staying with his guru Sri Ramakrishna and he was practicing intense spirituality he came saluted his master sri ramakrishna and ceramic Isner was telling I want to know how you meditate when I meditated under the bell tree I used to see various visions clearly and he is mentioning about different depositions do you see so that is his question and that direct experiences that is the main thing how a person will get interest in practicing meditation if we is not having some darshan revelation then cinema Krishna is mentioning very unique way a small balance as two needles the upper and the lower do we know that nowadays of course is all everything is totally different type but even in the village villages that ancient old fashion is there the balance it is having the two needles one in the upside and the below when it comes to in a straight way that means the way is correct he's telling coating that small balance as two needles the upper and the lower mind is the lower needle I was always afraid least the mind should move away from the upper needle so otherwise that means he wants to say the mind if it goes to the worldly things goes away from the god I'd see a man always sitting by me with a trident in his hand he threatened to strike me with it if the lower needle moved away from the upper one that is his own experience when huge to meditate he is to get the guidance of directly from the Sheba and that way he was practicing meditation then he is telling that is the system of the mind condition of the mind and when we come and see it and meditate not that it will be possible for anyone why spiritual progress is possible no spiritual progress is possible without the renunciation of last and cold that is the main thing no spiritual progress is possible without the renunciation of last and gold gold means the money wealth and the last means desire we have the desire how can we get God there are so many desires obviously the mind is going towards that I really feel this gospel of see Ramakrishna is a book of spirituality those who were sincere they should read it whatever the religion the path they are following it doesn't matter but it gives so practical the instructions those who are trying to practice meditation why they are practicing if it is spiritual progress then this is the thing first and foremost we have to check in our mind are you having the desire and to fulfill that desire we are going on trying to get the money the wealth the name the frame all that is coming after that in that case we can practice religion to be little model nothing wrong but we will never be able to realize God so that's why he is telling spiritual no spiritual progress is possible without renunciation how can one expect to attain God without renunciation suppose one thing is placed upon another how can you get the second without removing the fast this is the secret of success in spiritual life people who are having both people who are having the desire for name fame money at the same time if they say that they have realized God we have every reason to doubt about their deal demand so because it is not possible in Hindi caplet again and again to see Jah Haram Tana he come aha calm Tony guida so if that is the soul how can one expect to attain God without renunciation renunciation of what desire and where from the desire comes from the ego the eye consciousness and Saddam vocation is giving an wonderful example in giving the hints suppose one thing is placed upon another how can you get the second without removing the first one must pray to God without any selfish desire but selfish worship he practiced with perseverance is gradually turned into certain less worship is again giving the another sometimes some people they start with the selfish way but slowly slowly when they are going on practicing it is because it is the true that because it is the religion as because it is the God slowly slowly it Minds become completely purified without any ego that dawns if we take the name of God if you are praying to God if it will be obviously good and what is that good effect all our ego becoming lower and lower and revelation the idea will surely come about the realization of God cinema Krishna is giving the example drew bow is a crack at classical character this Trueba the small boy little boy he went to his father who was a king but the king could not take him on his lap why because his mother was not accepted and that is the reason the stepmother never allowed trouble to come near his father the king Ruba was said came back to his mother why and who can help me the mother say only God can help you Lord Vishnu the druga went inside and he was praying crying I want to go and get the affection of my father I want to get the share of this kingdom because I am also a prince oh god please help me my mother said you are the only person who can do it when he was going on praying a guru came that is the Narada and he said this is the name you go on repeat you need not to roam around who sit over here and go on repeating the river started repeating now through world is getting the message the mantra of the diksha up from the Guru and his desire is to get the that kingdom he is going on practicing practicing then when the God really appeared before him he told no I don't need that so that ruber practice tapasya to obtain his kingdom but at last he realized God why should a man keep up gold if he gets this whole searching for glass beads so when I get God why should I go for the kingdom it is nothing God can be realized when a man acquires shut WA see Ramakrishna is mentioning about the three gunas sattva Raja and Dhamma these are other research work as a human being behaves very peculiarly a person now is always in the news he killed so many people out of for nothing actually he was having said the guns and ammunitions and he was killing the innocent people whom he never made why still it is not revealed research is going on Polly she's trying and the man himself is dead nobody knows what is what was actually his intention to kill in that way depletion or what but the same person was so careful about his wife he had send his wife as the report goes to a distant place and his money for her everything he was taking care at the same time so cruel that he was killing the innocent people so this is the very peculiar mentality we find in the human being he is so good so compassionate so careful so caring at the same time he is cruel so why so the Rishi's they discovered within every human being there are three different qualities a mental condition changes one is shut wha at the time of sat walk the mind becomes very happy likes to help others like to take care of others all those good qualities that comes second is very egoistic a third of course at the last one the sattva then comes second is the Raja then dama dama is the last and the worst type of qualities in the same person so that is what see ramakrishna is mentioning the first one the sattva the love the purity the compassion the desire to hell that quality if a person is developing then only he'll be able to realize God otherwise not God can be realized when a man acquires shutteth householders engage in philanthropic work such as charity mostly with moti you sometimes some people the right words we also do we also help them they say can you please send my money to to answer place when two people the why don't you send you directly no because if I send that to them I won't get the tax benefit so I want to give you so that I get the tax benefit and that money should go over there so they will know that I have seen and when I go to that particular place they will recognize me and this different type of way they do what is that philanthropic work why they are doing with a selfish motive what is the result not spiritual development that is very clear so same thing if they do I can give so much of money why don't you forgive all those things that tax deduction and all that if you give to this Center get a tax deduction that is separate but they are taking the help of this Center sending the money to something somebody else taking the credit from then keeping all contact with them nothing wrong only thing as per se llama Krishna they are not going to acquire the software so that is the philanthropic work such as charity mostly with a motive that is not good the ceramic is nice telling but actions without motives are good same thing if they do without any motive immediately they will be spiritually developed sub to equalities will develop and slowly slowly they will go towards the realization of God which is the highest goal of every human life yet it is very difficult to leave motives out of one's actions so that is what they say must not one perform act of compassion see Ramakrishna is asking himself such as charity to the poor and then he is giving the replying I do not forbid it if a man has money he should give it to remove the sorrows and sufferings that come to his notice but inwardly he feels what can I do God alone is the doer I am nothing so friends this is what's Adamo krishna is the master he's the teacher he is the compassionate one the God himself so always every time in every step in every sentence he is careful about the development of the spiritual progress and that is why he is telling in this way if you are doing please do it but at the same time please think what can I do can I really remove the suffering of people am I so great no it is not possible God alone is the doer I am nothing if you think in this way the great achievement the great soul deeply affected by the sufferings of men show them the way to God there are different type of Donna in the Indian way they always say the Donna that the charity that the donation that helped that we are giving first is the under Donna vastra Donna drama Donna and this way it goes goes goes but last is that Donna Donna what is the guiana that God is the doer so happiness and suffering are the inevitable characteristics of the body those who are practicing religion not that they won't suffer not that they will all the time be happy though they are trying but when they realize God then all they become completely happy happiness and sufferings are the inevitable characteristics of the body one thing needful is ghana and bhakti God alone is substance all else is illusionary so one thing needful is ghana and bhakti Guiana is what God alone is substance all else is illusionary this is the ghana and along with that salam o krishna is asking for bhakti devotion nimbarka who is there also that Drita Drita so that is the philosophy he is mentioning there will be maybe in the coming Sunday we will be discussing about that that's a very interesting way they are explaining he is telling devotion is not necessary because the Brahman though his god but he is not person the when there is no person personality is there whom you are going to worship so that is his way we will discuss in details in the coming Sunday may be so here we find Gianna and bhakti serrano Krishna is telling Gianna should be there and bhakti also should be there bhakti means the devotion or gana one knowledge God alone is substance if a man is firmly convinced that God alone is the doer and that he himself is nothing then he will never make a false tail those who are not that with spiritual and cannot understand what is spiritual it is the benefit of spirituality their conception of God is a short of protection from the god as we are taking different other measures in the society insurance is there the police mission is there all these similarly God is also one of that type of thing protecting us that is a different way but those who are talking about the spirituality development of spiritual knowledge realization of the God for team these are the words the ceramic is names mentioning if a man is firmly convinced that God alone is the doer and that he himself is nothing then he will never make a false step why because there is no ego when there is no ego what happens again and again he is giving the example of the small children there's all the time depending on the mother and they always they are not holding the hand of the mother mother is holding the hand of the child who is a toddler doesn't know how to walk properly he doesn't know where the difficulties mother will take care similarly if one is depending completely on God there will be no problem and those who have realized God are aware that free will is a mere appearance sometimes some people they talk about the free will this free will see Ramakrishna is mentioning it is there but after the realisation of the god they can understand that is a mere appearance in reality man is the machine and God is its operator see Ramakrishna himself is to say I do not know anything when totapuri came after seeing the ceramic Easter those who have read the biography of the Ramakrishna you all know is a beautiful way it is described the totapuri told I like to keep you updated Jana I'd like to teach you cinema Krishna immediately said wait I like to get the permission from my mother and he went to the temple and got the permission of the mother the divine mother Kali and came back and reported yes mother said you have come only for me I will take that so that is the way he is having the relation with that God mother and son relation and for everything a grown-up man thirty years a fully grown up man he is going just like a child to his mother asking permission coming back and that is called truly God intoxicated person he doesn't know anything except God and for him God is mother Kali so when he mentioned in reality man is the machine and God its operator man is the carriage and God it's driver in wishes that Drita Drita Drita of nimbarka believed God is the controller he's sitting inside and in controlling so that conception when it is clear when we realize that then there is no problem one is guiana who never expects anything from anyone comes he is very far and that is a totally different way majority of the people are not that strong and for them the ceramic is neighs putting this if you are constantly depending on the God who is your controller who is your master as your mother as your father you believe and practice then there'll be no problem he said those who are firmly established in God may do as well without the devotee association of the devotees are necessary again and again this type of classes we are describing anyone can read this book book is available but when you are discussing that is also a one type of wonderful way to help us that is the Association help we are discussing about God and that Association is helping so he is telling but those who are established in God may do as well without devotee this is true of those who feel the presence of God both within and without sometimes they don't enjoy the devotees company so this is what happens when a man is completely merged in God anyone coming talking our presence is also disturbing because the mind is completely engrossed in the God now he's talking to the master Marcia and he's pointing to the Babu Ram Babu Ram afterwards he became a very famous sannyasi after Ramakrishna order Salam o Krishna still love him very much show me prema Nanda you see my own people have become strangers the ceramic ISNA is talking about his own mind because after the realization of God that is that should be the attitude of a sannyasi a mind that has given up all other things except God Rock Hall Ramlal and my other relatives seem to be foreigners Ramlal is NFU his all relatives are seemed to be foreigners then he is not keeping their company are not liking their company and strangers have become my own why the psychology is the love for God the same thing we happen in our lives also our friends our relatives our known people we don't feel that happiness in their company rather we feel happiness totally unknown people but they laughs Adama Krishna but they love the philosophy of Ramakrishna be we can endure they also are growing up in this atmosphere they become our own and Saddam occasion is mentioning because the one one Swamiji told me when I went to visit one Ostrom in Brindavan and he was telling I told Tommy G we visited this thing that thing that suddenly he said do you think that is your own in Bengali he said upon both Allah do you feel that all these things at your own I couldn't understand that at that very moment only the very elderly Swami so with respect I said yes after was I pondered and then I felt he was mentioning all that you see belongs to see Ramakrishna and naturally I love see Ramakrishna all these things belong to my God my beloved so it is my own that loved that affection do you feel like that so that is called the love for God see Ramakrishna the man like him he is telling you see my own people have become strangers and the strangers have become my own I used to sit there in course of time I became mad that phase also passed away collar which is Shiva is Brahman that which sports with collar is Kali the primal energy Kali moves even the immutable this is the great expression of the the collie that we think is nothing but the energy the supreme energy the primal energy that can move even the immutable so that is why the which sports with color is called the power of color color the Shiva which is Brahman then he said to master Marche this is a very very interesting today is Saturday go to the temple of Kali why he mentioned it Saturday in another time also he said Tuesday and Saturdays are honey days the honey DS means these are the days when the power of God it manifest master measure at the in the in the book they are giving this note Saturday and Tuesday are regarded as auspicious days for the worship of the Divine Mother Kali today is Tuesday and most of the asanas over here in that's why they have kept a clause in the Tuesday this a week date is very difficult for people to come and obtain the classes but most of the Astana is because they are very close to the cities they gave the audience and they give the class our Asama is little away from the cities and the localities their name so there is no neighborhoods so that is the reason so here is he says the Saturday and Tuesdays are regarded as auspicious days for the worship of the Divine Mother you better go to the Kali temple on Saturday as the master came to the buccal tree because those who have visited the dictionary they know but they still that tree is there buccal tree is there and that the steps that is going down to the Ganga where the mother used to be she's to use that particular steps to go to Veda in the Ganga that is still there the master was coming from the Panchavati when he reached to the buccal tree he said see DARPA and cheats Shakti cheat Atma and cheat Shakti now he's giving in a very gist the excellent the teachings of the Tantra cheat Atma and cheat Shakti the purusa is the cheat Atma and prakruti is the cheat Shakti Krishna is the cheat Atma and Sri Radha is the cheat Shakti but this way he is giving the example the devotees are so many forms of Cheeta Shakti in one player time the a great wish never st. he was the disciple of chaitanya mahaprabhu the Jiva Goswami and there was another lady saint she wanted to meet the Jiva Goswami this was in Brindavan Jiva Goswami he refused to act meet this lady there are some practices they won't like to meet or talk or see the ladies so he said no I am a monk I am NOT going to meet the ladies then she said do you think that you were male so that is the question there's only one Purusha is there that is Krishna who is residing in every being living in the poorer in the hearts of the human being so he is called Purusha it has nothing to do it the male body or female body here you find the ceramic is named is ment mentioning the devotees are he is not mentioning only the lady devotees he's mentioning all devotees the devotees are so many forms of the cheats shakthi this is the philosophy we are studying the philosophy in every Sunday now and we were discussing about the ramanuja's Vashisht advaita there is only one consciousness and in the next Sunday when we will be discussing about that there's a very interesting way to understand there is only one Chita Shakti a cheat sheet Atma but that Atma that Shakti is reflected everywhere so ceramic is name is mentioning they should think of themselves as companions of the chit Shakti Shri Dada this is the whole gist of the thing the whole religion depends on this one is consciousness another consciousness when active so one is cheap Atma that consciousness which ceramic is mentioning as Shri Krishna because it is easy to understand and at the same time this Shri Krishna when active is Shri Radha is not different but all others that Shakti is reflected so they can think that they are the Companions of the chilla Atma they are reflected by the chit Shakti there are also cheats at least of whom of the Krishna so we belong to Krishna we are the parts and personal of that this is the whole gist the master was in Samadhi and he began to come gradually down to the normal plane he was speaking to the mother like a small child mother why haven't you revealed to me dad form of yours the form that be switches the world I pleaded with you so much for it but you won't listen to me you act as you please cinema Krishna wanted to see that form how the same God is manifesting in every being and deluding people not giving knowledge to people how all these things are happening he wanted to see that but the mother didn't show that so he is complaining and he went on telling to mother and the master Masha noticing the voice in which these words were uttered very touching he went on mother one needs faith away with this wretched reasoning reasoning one needs faith faith in the words of the guru childlike faith so this is today we will conclude over here the failed so this is really very difficult we have faith in everything except in the faith of the guru guru means the God the God has come again and again in human form in different places in different time and he said that he is there he can be achieved he can be realized we always doubt those words whereas we believe everything when a person is giving an advertisement that I have developed a medicine and if you take this medicine all these things will be cure are we really having each and every one of us going and examining that no I go and ask the doctor is it all right yes all right I take that is it not faith in the whole life is all faith and belief I do not know what is going to happen the great the leaders who are having their body girls with the arm the girls they are believing those body turds they're completely depending on those body girls he's also faith but the words of this guru we do not believe so here's Ramakrishna's telling this is the faith we will discuss about the faith and also the other teachings of sri ramakrishna in our next class let us conclude this need Anjana medium
