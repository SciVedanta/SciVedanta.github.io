[166. Panchama Veda 166 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24E9UeH4GGc)

every time today also we will discuss the wonderful words of a Sri Ramakrishna but just before that I'd like to inform you because most of you know that our very long standing very close devotee these Bala - IG she passed away in the sunday today we attended her funeral and she was lying peacefully and her whole life was dedicated for the service that his really excellent may request you to stand up and for one minute bring for her the stickers life goes on it never stopped this world this universe when it was great if we do not know there are so many different opinions and this individual life how many times we have come that also we do not know how many times again will have to come that truth is not known to us is going on but we have come to know from the teachings of the great Souls the day's an end and how to end it by knowing our souls the moment we come to know from where we are coming there it aims right from the constraints of the Ganga and the motion we have been gone if you go on following the Ganga upward towards North you will end up in one place Ganga three we're from the Ganga is started at that over there the Ganga stops so like that if we go back to our source what is the spiritual life going back to our source and how we go there are so many different ways paths means teachings of the air and according to our aptitudes we follow some very emotional devotion path is the best of them some little intellectual so they follow the path of jnana discrimination which are some they work the work they work for others with love and without expecting any return they also go back to the same source and someday withdraw and they meditate and this is the reason the ramakrishna mission founder Swami Vivekananda of course with the blessings of the valancy ramakrishna and maharaja the motto they have given we have seen that our symbol all the four yugas to mine and it's called seven nayavada and the labonza ramakrishna again and again giving the importance on realizing this Atman this God now let us start with this mantra which sees double kata hoop Amrita unwritten means the nature there's a conception there's a sort of a liquid as he that if you drink then you become immortal but nothing - nothing like that this is the knowledge the moment you know that this body this mind behind this is the consciousness and if you can reach to that consciousness and can understand that consciousness you will see the same consciousness which is within us within me the individual the Jeeva it is a name reveal everywhere that is the last knowledge and that is called Vedanta so we will follow the steps and slowly slowly starvation is taking unto death our different ways we read you will understand let us chant [Music] DVD return calmodulin Shravana Mangalam srimad artem Bobby greener de bourree dodging are just by hearing by reading but discussing these wonderful words also spirituality he will get all those memories which other people they Eclair by donating a huge huge property or dream any other food works just by reading this book why then our idea about the spiritual life becomes very clear and Raghavan Saddam Oh Krishna is telling everyone is going towards God knowingly or unknowingly he never say that oh you are not going and somebody cannot go everyone is going towards God this is very important they will all realize him if they have sincerity and longing apart the moment we are having the sincerity the strong desire that I am going to realize God whatever path I follow whatever language I use whatever the ways I will reach over there and that is the ultimate goal selamat East is very confident but why we unnecessarily and this is in the world human history if you see the main conflict is religion religion is supposed to be the source of joy happiness brotherhood fraternity but instead the religion has become the source of all convinced why because we misunderstood why you misunderstand our ego we interpret in this way all others are bad and he should have no right to stay with us read on and that is the reason ultimately we understand we have only gone back instead of going forward so that is why I see Ramakrishna is telling all scriptures vedas puranas tantras he is not mentioning about the other scriptures but he mentioned false - just in Veda Tantra and Parana mostly those who are following the path of gana they don't like the path of bhakti if people are praying or in the emotional way talking singing dancing in the name of God they will laugh how these people don't know anything or fools there's a great wrong thing so that is the reason he is mentioning the Vedas to whom instilling to master ma Jai who is the master Masha is the representative of the young people in those days they all were very much inclined to the Brahmo Samaj and it was the brahma semaj of the mixture of guiana and bhakti this to say the God has no form because of the strong propagation of the Christianity God can never have the fall they also followed that and then they say no but we have to pray and so the prayer also mixed up in that so like that they were almost like imitating the Christianity dear going and young people educated people all were influenced by that particular thought in those days just Brahmo Samaj cinema Krishnan knew that master Marche is also having the relation with their ideology so he is mentioning vader's that means the path of weather is combine everything puranas and the Tundra's seek him each capital alone and no one else only that one now he says satchitananda I am reading from the page four to three this is the sat-chit-ananda that is actually the indication of the brahman as well as Brahman is all-pervading consciousness and because we cannot conceive that consciousness in that way is all-pervading how we can do it at the best sometimes in the Vedic meditation we feel that we are the light and we are not the body lien of the mind and all these that is we are staying here all men's away in that light and we are light light everywhere even that even that also is having something to hold on that is the light sometimes we are meditating on the ohm ohm ET brahma so that bone color is also having the form ohm is not the brahma is only helping us to anchor our mind on something so such cheat on and the saruba would say like this existence knowledge and please absolute existence we know that we like to leave all the time let me leave so many people today gathered in that funeral ceremony and one of her very close and she was lying down as a dead body none of us felt that some day will come and be like this we are thinking we all right that is the mystery that skull Maya you can never understand and stick to that understanding the truth that all these that we see is nothing but false why because our root is such means existence there's usually the way you can serve is called truth and here the particular meaning is existence existence the sense of existence we don't like to die we're from it came from the ruled what is the root sir then cheat we always like to know what is these what is this what is this curiosity what is the root of Agartha curiosity inquisitive Ness that is the root of Vedanta so we knew you are going on asking questioning trying to understand that is the special very special in human being so that is called such chilled and then ultimately what Ananda that on the means that joy today one Swami came is a different Mahinda monk and he's from the Maryland which Washington DC I told what is the name of the rostrum on his own on good day he himself is doing it under the bullies Donald the joy the happiness and happiness without having anything that is the joy if we are having some food we are happy you happy if you are having the frames we are happy and like that and like that and like that but it's all temporary when the food will be exhausted we are unhappy when the friends will go away again the happiness so no dependence on anything but we are happy how it is possible well I am happy with you myself so that is exactly what ceramic is not giving the game that which is called satchitananda Brahman in the Vedas called satchitananda Sheba in the Tantra now he is among the Hindus there are and in those days these were very strong differences divisions and even today if you go you see they will never accept those who are followers of the Shiva this is what God you worship no I got to Krishna ok ok look like that they will never talk to you so much proud our bath is the best so that we see Ramakrishna is bringing the combination it said if you are sincere in your bath ok he will reach over the air but if you had not only good stick and thinking that I can reach over there nothing is going to happen we'll be in the same spot constantly going around so satchitananda Brahmin in the beta sat-chit-ananda Shiva in the Tantra and again he alone is called satchitananda Krishna in the karana purana means Bhagavata Purana mother there is the mean krishna's biography the Bhagavata Purana we are studying other word every Sunday most of the time different people like our dish mother Vidura then others also we go on speaking of the high vedanta philosophy in the hood who is Krishna is absolute so that is the very very uniqueness and we missed that always uniqueness is Hinduism through personal God and Goddess as we go to the impersonal being so that word sadhana Tichenor same and he is talking about the other things also cinema Krishna and not constantly speaking about the spirituality something is to ask ever a what you now here asking ROM ROM is a doctor and you know the Bengali family didn't even allow the men the boys for cooking and all it is as if the whole thing should be for the women so they teach the girls to how to cook but the boy is only doing anything else and criticizing maybe sisters so anyway so these years now it is asking dad his doctor a very famous man he is asking the ROM do you cook you don't means the naturally Rama was hesitant no sir he said you may try it Salaam Krishna's asking you may try it with your meals take a little clarified butter meat out of cow's milk that will purify your so that is the way he is guiding his disciple why he is a different type of person all people who work for me and I will talk about the car and he said Amma Krishna is asking him to help himself so that is the way it should begin you know now I can understand why in our training in the monastic life why he is to ask us to do all this work who is to 100 we never did all the things in the house and never the rosters to do that but all these the beginning you must have to do why to crash your ego from the very rich family they have gone but you have to do these very menial type of work so-called menial so naturally egos the ceramic is nice asking his disciple then is asking about his parents do you love your parents no no I don't like my mother particularly and she was as the stepmother then I don't like mother why she comes to our house I don't know and etc etc then slowly it came to give indra and he is telling said suppose once Barings activity of a terrible crime if he has seen look at it this is true to learn and this is the culture suppose once pearance the guilty of a terrible crime in Eocene partially do about so how we look at the appearance ceramic is not what if they are you must not renounce your mother even if she is commit adultery for his son this is the training disease curve you have to understand if the mother has given me the birth and mother has given me everything in this life not all my existence is because of this mother and the father so I should not forget them there's the first type of morality truth then next step will be the spirituality then he is going on telling our the father and the mother mere trifles no spiritual practice will be a fruit unless they are pleased children was intoxicated with the love of God still before dating to the monastic life for how many days did he try to persuade his mother to give him her permission to become a monk so that he is giving the example the children now were so great constantly he was merged in the thought of God was still without the permission of the mother you cannot take in our cases also you had to write mother then with heart permission only we could join in their order there's sometimes some people they will go away that was the tradition they will go and they will hide somewhere the parents don't know suddenly up to 12 years or 14 years they will appear nothing like that means the moment you have come and joined immediately next day write to your parents write to your mother are they willing to allow you to be monk or not so that is the way so they must have to and let me say this to you to aim so this is the genuineness aim is the writer he is noting down these points you could simply forget this we would not have known anything about and Serano Krishna is telling this to him only not to other devotees reproachfully he is telling to and let me say this to you your father and mother brought you here you have left home with your wife you have cheated your parents you have come away with your wife and children and you feel you have become a holy man he's telling to his that disciple his very close disciple the master Michelle so this is called the guidance of a guru guru always tells the truth for the benefit of the disciples okay it is your personal life I have nothing to say guru we never live to like there they will guide you all the time every moment so what is good for you and he is telling your father doesn't need any money from you otherwise I would have cried shame on you it's long-distance telling to master MA chère everybody in the room became grave and remain silent so this is the first type of spirituality you must have to respect your father and mother and that is why ma 3d movable pitri devo bhava the mother is God as father is the God without practicing all these things suddenly we go and purchase a victor on money and then we become the damn thing it's not so easy so the basic thing is this so then he is telling a man has certain depths to be his debit to God and nourishes and then his Davis to mother father and wife he cannot achieve anything without paying the tip he goes to his bearing him is indepted to his wife as well there are people who speak verses record verses from the scripture and talk being but in the conduct they are quite different Rama presently he is mentioning a name of a person impression done constantly visa pouring opium and milk for the utter yogi in a hotter Yogi's those who practice the asanas the Galata yogi they need this type of now in those days and now also opium is used mainly for the medicine this yoke is this to leave completely bared body and the mosquitoes and other insects bite severe and moreover we doubt that you cannot survive I've seen in the Himalaya just by Alberti and it is snowing the sitting over there it is impossible without the help of this type of medicine and for the the pain and all those things in those days this was the medicine this to apply but the harder Yogi's this to take milk a lot with opium and this man is applying them and he tell him the Islamic is know why he is mentioning this man is quoting the scripture he said that Manu Manu means the Manu the Hindu law giver enjoying sit upon man to serve the sadhu but his own mother hasn't enough to eat so that is how salam o krishna is observing and he is now quoting she walks to the market to buy her own groceries it makes me very angry and with lumpfish 'no the god himself robert our barista and he is angry with whom the person who is trying to be spiritual and for that the way he has adopted ignoring his own mother the old lady he is going on doing something and thinking am becoming the spiritual the God is not liking it I am very angry but here you have to consider another thing then he's telling when he managing intoxicated with started love of God then who is his father and mother wife he forgives all relations for him it is okay his love of God is so intense that he becomes mad with it then he has no duty to perform so then the this question comes the Shankar Acharya there is a tradition that Brahma chharia gosta vanaprastha sannyas from the eighth century BC they say at the time of Shankar Acharya sometime the calendar the debates are there Shankar Acharya seen but the moment you feel like giving up the whole thing strong feeling to renounce then you are having the support of the scripture you can leave otherwise you have to follow all these four stages four stages of life here Arriba by Raja Sahib robbery the moment you feel like giving up better job villager means giving up and proper JIT will go out so that is the again the support of the in the scripture and here he is telling like that and sadhana Krishna is again giving the coat coating from the chaitanya mahaprabhu children at this intoxication he is using the word intoxication Nisha Rasta that mean he forgives everything that is intoxication and he says he was not aware a hunger thirst of sleep that is called the god intoxication all at once Ramakrishna exclaimed because the moment he said their chaitanya he immediately got that influence of children within him he felt like that he stood up and he said ah Chaitanya he stood up and master to the devotees Chaitanya means undivided consciousness see Chitina means gauranga ma Prabhu the chick genitive is so famous in day among the Hindus and he is actually the founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnav semaj and now that particular school of philosophy is so strong so powerful all over the world that the Krishna consciousness there the follower chaitanya mahaprabhu all these things but saddam o krishna immediately not the person immediately he takes our mind to completely the Supreme Being and it says Chaitanya means on divided consciousness the one gentleman was asking me the moment you say Brahman is consciousness why I searched the dictionaries where it never says like that the God means others being an out there as a diss conscious concept of consciousness purely pedantic and in the Upanishads we find this consciousness he shava shava Dom's album enchilada t on jihad so each possum the using the word initially she means the god but did his covering evening how it is possible for any P having a form to cover the each and everything is not possible so how it is covering them consciousness so consciousness naturally is that but as because it is not possible for us to understand what is this consciousness though here very much funded our week our consciousness individual consciousness and the inertness of the body and mind we can understand that even then it is very difficult to understand actually truly about this consciousness all-pervading Chiltern eeeh during the saturated each and every point is nothing but the consciousness so this is a checked under means undivided consciousness and to the a little poeple immediately is coming down the Gopal helter people afterwards he became the monastic member so this to say in Bengali Buddha papa guna means the elder the Buddha Koopa is to say and he says do you intend to go on a pilgrimage now that people have different type of desire we have a devotee he has already visited the very difficult pilgrim Center 4:30 times I think he's preparing now for the 14 times so he always goes like that some people will always go so many times they will go on Counting challi down they will go to all these places the gang go three Yamunotri kadar and put three the four charlie down once you go it is okay but some people feel like that they will go and this Gopal senior Gopal he said do you intend to go to pilgrimage now Gopal sir yes sir I should like to wonder about a little because in the mind they like to have the practice of spirituality so in thinking this way ROM the doctor now he is telling to go path he means the Masters Ram Tichenor says that one becomes if you teach a girl this is a sweet word to teach a girl after being a Buddha girl boo-hoo-hoo the Boudicca means the water booooo-whoo means meaning a man is going on visiting different building center and going on drinking water in different places so who the the water he is drinking any many different places so boo-boo-boo-boo means many and cut each other he is sitting in one place so this is the two difference the people will go on visiting different places and then ultimately they will come and sit the saddle that visits many holy places is called beaucoup the God he whose craving for travel has been satisfied and who sits down in one place is called to teach occur he's explaining Rama Sri Ramakrishna to that Gopal and other devotees as long as a man feels that God is there he is ignorant but he attains knowledge when he feels that God is here so dear and sometimes you go to the temple language or the sprinkle Ganga water and then we bathe and put on the wash clothes and then only go to the temple and thinking this is the holy place our food is the only place because constantly the gods name up there but God is not only clear God is everywhere that we have to understand God is in every being God is everywhere slowly slowly we have to understand that when you go we as a student we go to the school or colleges we go to the laboratory and that is the place where in practice all this different type of deaths and there is a science class but in our life every day the science is there every moment everywhere something is happening it must have a cause that is the science you go to the root we understand that that is science we should ghana big tiana what is the big and special knowledge what is the special knowledge understanding that cause of it why the wind is blowing there must be a cause and why the wind is not doing it must be cause say everything is a cause and this cause and effect we can understand we discover many things the one man who was sitting under an apple tree they say is apple tree and it fell down and then he thought why it is coming down why does not gonna so he started searching out the cause and he discovered law of gravity and that is the way we always from the nature so many things happen a man is so kind so good so gentle suddenly one day he misbehaves why something must have happened instead of immediately reacting if we go back and then try to understand his mind and then he will come to know something is disturbing that man he is part of but he cannot share that anxiety to others with others so that is educating him anything happens immediately he flares up in our society most of the time the husband's they will come back and then the only person they can shout is a wife so they will go on show us killed of course now it is white shorts wipes are also shouting back circle now it's almost the balance why do you why because of the bosses and the offices and they are all this places the pool man cannot do anything when he comes back he wants to express that anxiety he stood the anger for that particular person is the anxiety that he was suffering is just letting it out if you understand it you are a very good person very good friend immediately if you strike back you break the whole relation that we have to understand from he began to say the nature is provoking you to react react react don't do that be the master of your nature the so many people that are telling so many ways and criticizing appraisee doing these and doing that you must control and that is called the spirituality and this way slowly as long as a man feels God is there he is ignorant but he attains knowledge when he feels that God is here then he is telling a story and in the moment any advices there he will tell the story why we understand the story and remember the story and through the story it becomes very clear he says a man wanted to smoke and he went with to light his charcoal it was the lead of night and the household was asleep after he had not decreed till someone came down to open the door aside the man he asked hello was the magic the man replied conjugates you know how fond I am of smoking I have come here to lick my charcoal the neighbor saved haha you were a fine man indeed you took the trouble to come and do all this knocking at the door why you have a lighted Lantern in your hand the man was carrying the lantern and he forgot so that is exactly what happens we go on searching the recently I was in one of the TV advertisement the commercial advertisement and it was very nicely they put it one lady she is going out in the office and sees she was going on searching for her glasses and then after after searching in many places she didn't find then one requested her husband to help her to find it and husband immediately saw the glasses are on the one haruhi it is there and the son was also with the husband both of them they looked at each other okay we can help you only if you promise that when you come back in and bring so and so sustain for us she said yeah when I am coming back from Miami who will purchase and brilliant no you have to promise keeping your hand on your head and when she kept the hand on her head and it was there so like that we go on searching for God and then the Guru says okay I can do that but only thing you have to withdraw your mind from outside and to go down it's not the Guru that helped me it's not the scripture that helping only guiding who is doing it by the person who is trying to do it I am striving to control my all the senses but that we we always go down and suddenly one day I see what meguro saw and then the supreme guru also saw the same thing that's like a goddamn business a you see that moon if we're gonna solve this moon right from the Vedic age then the Buddha the Shankar Acharya everyone saw this moon only so when you look at the moon immediately felt fear oh if they have seen this moon and same thing and they begin put they became Shankar Acharya they became children no Mahaprabhu why not me and that gives the strength I am also going to be like that what a man sees is very near him still he wanders about from place to place then eastling Sadam occasion another this chapter is coming to in the second chapter a tries to an actor it is Saturday May 24 1884 Sudama Krishna was sitting on the small couch in his room rock-hard aim several of the devotees represent a special worship of colleague had been performed in the temple the previous night in connection with the worship a theoretical performance of the Big D asunder had been staged in the not indeed he all Hindu temple is having the government and the not month II sanctum sanctorium the Garbo Gandhi and all is not money and not one good actually cultural place there the deviate and the conversation the music the dance and critical performances all these to have over there the social gathering and it is the reason the into those days when people's to actually die in their own houses or the birthdays to take place in their own houses the system is you are not supposed to come to the temple that is the reason because the bacteria and all those if you come then you mean spray that the same thing among the villagers or the people will be gathering over there so that is the reason they say 11 days 13 days 15 days sometimes 21 days barring those family members not to come to the temple but now everything is happening in the hospital and maybe sometimes and religion is passing away in India thousands of miles away first even they follow that same rule you are not supposed to come it's not necessary so we have to understand according to the situation this seems changes this has nothing to do with the religion here the Saddam Krishna he was sitting and the theoretical performance was over the master - the actor the actor came to meet the Salaam dish - to take his blessings your acting was very good if a person excels and this is that very important if a person excels in singing music dancing or any other act she can also quickly realize God provided his stripes sincerely why because if anything if he excels that means he made his mind completely concentrated on that particular subject the dance or music or reading or anything it becomes totally concentrated and very sure and that same focus if it goes to God it will be very easy for you to realize God that's why some now and then when I made the Indian - for I haven here in different places I always say you people can realize God very easily why almost of all of you are very very intelligent much higher level than many others and you have been successful in your life now in the same concentration with which you have become successful in your life that you have to turn towards God that's all it is the same mind in the same light focusing that same light I am seeing something if I turn that light somewhere else I will see something else the light is the same focus is the same mind is the same concentration is the same that's why some distance telling there's an ordinary actor but Saddam business is inspiring we have this quality and acquire this quality you know in those days these to sing themselves it is not nowadays the movie artists they'll be only leaping they are not singing at all somebody else is singing but these people they used to sing themselves and moreover and the camera will be placing in such a way that even a nun I saw one a lady she's an actress in Delhi Airport and in the movies she used to look so good but in the reality when she came I looked at her as oh my god he lives like that so anyway this you can hide many things in this nominees movie but in those days it is all all around people will be sitting and looking at you and judging you watching you so obviously they were really good people the good actors the cinema business pointing to him in that way then he is asking to him just as you practice much in order to sing dance or play an instrument so one should practice the art of fixing the mind on God and this is the practical teachings how to control the mind the we were practicing so much when the examination approaches people is to get up early morning they'll be studying Tindall with you date night and again they will get up and forget eating food and like that and when they are successful or now I will go and enjoy the similarly the same way I have come to realize God and I must have to put my mind into there if we can't do it is so easy that's when Islamic Christian studying and he is telling one should practice regularly such disciplines as worship Java and meditation sometimes worship is not possible when as we do were here is not possible to do all the time but mental worship is possible Manasa puja they call it and sometimes if you have the time now people are so busy they explain money five minutes then they would go so if you have the time if you are sitting and then thinking the time actually washing the feet of the God and then girl ending then burning incense sticks lighting the lamp and bringing the food for the God and doing the Aarti all these things mentally do he will forget the whole world and it be merged in that activity and that way constantly since you are doing the those activities be repeated by your mind the Gandiva is constantly going on telling I am pure I am pure I am pure but the doctor is very easy because the mind needs activity and I am giving the mind the same activity but the activity will help me to purify my mind how because the worldly thoughts won't be there so that is what see Ramakrishna is telling then taking the name of Lord chopper and meditation concentrating on the same object just so then he is asking are you married any children the man said he said I had a girl who died another child has been born now the master ha it did it and the birth and also going on I did and the birth that is the chakra it goes on and on and on and on it never ends only human being can stop it by knowing Who am I why did I stay to watch you performance the rankest is telling him why did I steal to watch your performance now two things he steady I found the rhythm the music and the minority are correct look at it that God appreciated only perfection so we don't think that is ramakrishna thing it is god the god only appreciate perfection one person he was going on singing and his voice was terrible and other people they were plugging their ears and they're going to the temple coming out then one person he going to do itself while he was singing hey I am singing for God then he said we are disturbed and do you think God will be happy God is very fine so obviously you must be perfect and this perfection that is God and also in the ramakrishna mission the training is whatever you do you must be perfect and Swami Vivekananda say my water perfect and fast and to bring the perfection the theme that I can do in one day I will take one month know that under perfection means perfect and the first frames why I am telling this but these are the steps to proceed to our spirituality we do not really understand this and particularly something in our mind and we are so in discipline where do we see it we forget sometimes these and that and when you go and open our shoes god forbid we will sometimes take somebody's shoes and go away there's a grave problem it happens if you go down and see in there that our the shoe room and all so many T's for almost a year the boots are hanging the hats over there the banks are there people forgot and never came back there is all lying over there and they think that they will realize God with this mind the mind so much scattered can't remember that I am NOT having my quote so these are the first tariffs to prepare our mind otherwise you won't be these are the very simple words as if are very very important words then one person is telling secondly he said why did I stay to watch your performance I found the rhythm the music and the melody all correct second he said then the divine mother showed me that it was God alone who acted in the performance in the rules of the players this is the spiritual way of looking at things now we see so many things but if we can turn it into spirituality God who has dressed in these different forms and he is acting and playing and dancing and singing he was looking at that performance but actually meditating on God this is the speciality so the spiritual way of looking at things and at the same time going for the perfection these are the two objects that do two ways we can always practice then after is asking sir what is the difference between gamma and common our last and desire what is the difference between the last and a desire frames are the searching the answer to this question to the all-knowing Google and avail google also could not give the answer to this question and now salon business giving as in English they say Pat came the answer immediately he is giving answer last is like the root of the tree and desires are branches and drinks so that this last that goes down within us so we must have to be very very careful I just read this small the teachings of Lama Krishna and we aim one cannot completely get rid of the six patterns and he's giving the name first last anger greed and like this six fashions they are our enemies and the shortlisted Shri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita shortlist is this things into what commish grow the Asia thank you come YCJA crew the Asia and this is come this is the last and we that is not satisfied immediately the growth anger and these are gamma Asha through the Asia rajo-guna samosa then second lining says mashallah Mahatma they have to complete sinful things and Martian are very very dangerous maharaja namaha partner we didn't he her body now you must understand these are your enemies a man cannot see God unless he gives his whole mind to him the mind is wasted on many other things thanking friends thank you for coming we will continue the discussion about and quoting from the different scriptures when the ceramic ISNA say a man cannot see God unless he gives up the whole mind to him how the others yoga Vasishta and mahabharata and other scriptures how they are supporting it so we will discuss that in our next class let us conclude with this sloka papa Drita begun by he shove at autumn but a Misha medium-long Krishna [Applause] that said three dharma krishna our eponymous two [Music]
