[157: Panchama Veda 157- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw527V-Q5uQ)

this mantra Takahama written topped achieve annum kobe be rewritten Calma sharp Ravana Mangalam 3 madam booby green ENT a gory dodging ah today as you see is the holy birth TT of xiaomi preeminent the g is one of the direct disciples around three ramakrishna he was not a brahmin this the speciality usually people is to say traditionally that one should born in a higher caste family otherwise they won't realize God and that was wrong completely wrong that's why God wants it am Krishna he chose from the family we're not the boys were not Brahmins when this boy came young boy with his mother she was very very devoted and she wanted to serve the ones Ramakrishna and she told can I give you something you know what he asked I'll be very happy if you give your son to me and look at the mother immediately she agreed it will be a blessings for me if you really accept him and this young man came started staying with Ramakrishna and of course frequenting slowly slowly got associated in other young people they formed a small group and afterwards when they took the sannyasa they promised they were very rich people show me blame Ananda if you ever go you can see still that family those buildings are their huge property they were the landlords and the building says the huge buildings that they that they gave to Ramakrishna mission and most of the time these young boys after the passing away of Avanza ramakrishna they were not getting any food and shelter and any any opportunity dish to go to Prem Ananda's mother and she used to cook very nicely as the feed theme and his to have wonderful time there was a big pond Leicester have swimming and all that most of them were below 24 so obviously you can understand one day dear they failed the mother failed all these young boys so nicely it was nice night then certainly narendra not the leader of the group told see today we have eaten so much and naturally the mind is going to the body all night will meditate who will come everybody raise their hands and all they can came outside the room they lighted a fire set around that and they started meditating whole night past and certainly as if inspired by the divine force that young nor in the north stood up and started telling but the wonderful life of Jesus Christ how the Jesus of Nazareth he gave His life for the love of humanity how he went out and practiced and then realized God and then came back and started distributing that wonderful knowledge to those people he was going on telling about in and each and everyone became very much inspired afterwards they were not aware next day they came to know that was the Christmas Eve 24th December night so they promise that we will also renounce like Jesus we will also give our hearts blood for the service of the humanity all these young people and if you go to that particular place even today that there's a moral is there in that mural they have depicted wonderfully all young people standing surrounding the fire taking the oath and that was the first time they took the oath to renounce the heart and home to become sannyasi to became the Mong and they became monk so all these stories then after her slowly slowly began and got some money at the two American ladies they keep him some money with that he purchased a plot of land on the Bank of Ganga balloon mark aim up and he became the first manager of the betterment new boys were coming they were all were being initiated into the sannyasa and he was looking after them Rahman and Swamiji gave his name preeminent the why because Braga wants long distance to say this boy is beauty born and wins the Ramakrishna's to go in samadhi he asked you should not touch me except that preeminent Barbara the Babu Ram was pure and Serrano Krishna some time told that he is the embodiment of Radha that is why so much purity so Barbara Maharaj is to serve Ramakrishna afterwards he became the manager and he used to go and look after all these young people who were coming guiding them but one thing we will in his life we find the love for all people he never went out afterwards long afterwards he used to go to there and he had the wonderful capacity to draw people that's why Swamiji told Bob Arum you should not give initiation if you give initiation that people will not come to the Rakhal that is brahmananda used to in his own way he never talked with people and like that who will go to him the borinage attraction he was so attractive looking also very handsome so people is to go to him and is to love him and in particularly East Bengal theatre very good big followers this Swamiji told you can go to visit there but no initiation they should come and take initiation from our rocker so that was the way he never gave in very few but he used to do like that one incident I can remember he was in pouring and some the someone from the Christian garden he was standing at the gate of the juggernaut and he was criticizing juggernaut very abusive languages he was using and after offering his respect Swami preeminent the was coming out when he heard through the words about the juggernaut it was impossible for him to restrain he didn't go to fight but he started singing the name of the Lord name of the hurry as chaitanya mahaprabhu's to do and his divine attraction and the way he was singing dancing alone clapping the hands all people came to him gathered together within a minute there a huge crowd and all singing dancing then that gentleman became very much afraid and he left and primatology was very happy that I could drive him out then afterwards all people who are happy oh we have to drop him out and now the night when he was sleeping Salam Krishna appeared and said why you insulted that man he was also talking about me if anybody is talking about the Jesus he is talking about me don't you know that I belong to each and every one then he was Oh am sorry so that is ramakrishna mission one of our Swamiji he wrote an article and there he could because we were injera pongee I can tell that named hunter Ruben and DG he wrote an article and indirectly it criticized the Christians about didn't president of the order he went through that and he called him and scolded him and from now onwards five years you should not write anything and if you write that should not be published so that was the punishment so that is the broad outlook why that you will read over here today the realisation of the one see Ramakrishna all pervading the summon I am Acharya he was the Samana Archer he was the master of all that came from different sides were enrolled different faiths different religions this is ceramic ISNA and this Barbra Maharaj this primal energy he used to stand with the side of the Ganga and to see that the boat by both the people don't those days that was the only transport so it is to go by go to Calcutta you'll be calling them a you must be very hungry where did you come take some food didn't go to the market they were not known but he was in that way and then he won't say anything to anyone particularly the juniors he will go and he will light the fire and again you start cooking the naturally the younger bromwich Aryans and novices what they will do this to come and say and then help him and this to grumble from me why you were inviting all those people they don't know us they don't have any idea about the ceramic Asian unnecessarily you are inviting them he said it is not unnecessary a little bit of prasada that you cook over here offer mentally to God and give to anyone devotion is going to grow I'm spreading the seeds of devotion to all these people they will come when balloon mud will be crowded like anything and today it is true it just becomes so big if you go to our headquarters Ramakrishna mission balloon mod is so weak and vast even then any function minimum two to three lakhs people two hundred three hundred thousand people will be there and that is the contribution of Xiaomi premanande and we will read from today how one see Ramakrishna he is also explaining giving his own original realizations he is telling it is my nature to believe that my mother knows everything friends I will ask you to be attentive to these words one line he is telling I am the son of my mother mother knows everything next line he telling the big granny condition not only Gani big annie condition she is telling it is my nature to believe that my mother knows everything it was she who would speak at Rajan dimitra's house Rajan Demeter was very very rich person and educated person all people assembled over there see Ramakrishna who never attended in school and not knowing how to speak and they were expecting Sri Ramakrishna to speak over there he was going on talking to mother I am NOT going to talk you should talk the dependence on the divine mother and hearts are the only effective words then he mentioned one ray of light from the goddess of wisdom stands a thousand scholars and that really what he was Saddam Krishna told that was accepted by hundreds of people the scholars they could not deny that rather these two say we have only read and you have realized those truth all of them so that is the mother has kept me in the state of him bhakta look at it he is telling in the same line the mother has kept me in the state of a doctor then comma a big Johnny now those who are studying the Vedanta Deva so it is contradictory biani our big journey and doctor they are all different they cannot be the same but the one see ramakrishna is telling the big journey who has understood everything but mother has kept me in the condition of a bhakta a devotee who always feel mother is all this is a beautiful way he is actually giving the instruction of one new system of God realization that is called suntan of our the attitude of a child attitude of a son now we know that traditionally as we were the other day we mentioned we had traditionally the Hindus they have utilized all the different moves that the human being is having for the realization of God because what the Hindus God realization is the our goal so obviously so they have mentioned Shanta a philosophical mode that we all the time judging and that way and then Basia the serving the lord as best possible way Bath's earlier the affection of the mother love of the mother for our own child then secure the friendly way talking with the the God considering God his own frame madura feeling thinking that God is my lover beloved and that attachment as the both the lovers are having between each other and finally ceramic is no deal were five traditionally he has refined Ramakrishna adding one more attitude that is attitude of his son towards the parents and this is most apt for the modern age why whatever the wobble what about the mood that you are adopting towards the God you had to try but the suntan above the attitude of a son attitude of a child towards the father and mother no try only one thing faith my mother is there she will take care of me my father is there he will surely take care of me that tremendous faith in the existence of God and also the conviction under percent conviction that God is my father God is my mother and God is going to take care of me everything every way that is the new introduction of sri ramakrishna for this spiritual path and he is telling in this way faith in God self negation and at the same time it comes same sightedness that is the ultimate thing it comes the ceramic isne was telling these that this one the mother has kept me in such a way a bhakta and the big journey that is why I joke with Rakhal and others had I been the condition of a gyani I couldn't do that here is the condition of a journey and beginning then the doctor the pornog Gianna the gianni means he understood that knowledge and he's all the time going on remembering that knowledge keeping that knowledge in his mind and he's there conscious every moment not to forget that that is the condition of the gang and beginning is one who knows each and everything I saw one gentleman he came to give the lecture and he has some small small notes and before the meeting he was going on reading on that those things and then others are going talking but he's not listening to that he's so attentively reading his own because he understood that I'm listening I am having those things in my hand and it is in my mind I won't be able to speak so that is called Gani this is a knowledgeable person he knows but at the same time he is not having complete confidence so he wanted but those who knows everything that subject they have mastered on that it has become so easy for them natural normal for them so you just go on talking like see Ramakrishna he not remembering anything from any scripture but he knows the truth so he's telling the truth so he says beginning afterwards it is in this state I realize that it is the mother alone who has become everything in what stage began stage and there the those who have realized those who have reached to that beginning stage then they know that it is God who has become everything I see her everywhere in the Kali temple I found that mother hostel had become everything even the weekend even the brother of Hobart indeed that means recently someone visited his brother was also we do not know why suddenly he is referring maybe that the gentleman was not that way devoted person but even then ceramic esna saw it is the same mother who has become everything and ceramic isne this is called Shama the sheet WA you see one cannot exclude even a wicked person that is Hinduism the Hinduism cannot exclude anyone this is the ultimate of Hindu knowledge and that is called beyond the some other one you know there came a story that one lady who wanted to sing sharmaji refused to attain the program then she started singing that famous song of the hadith sir - Prabhu Mary ABBA gonna cheat on adhara oh my lord you should not look at my the faults some other she had nama Tijara because your name is same sightedness immediately Shahi learned that was a teaching sharmini learned that some other sit here also we find in different script it speaks about that God is one he come Eva Adityan those are the students of Atlanta we all know about it again and again the same one line the dictum is coming a come one Eva only a DTM there is no to he come Eva a DTM only one and there is no to to give the emphasis the moment you say one it is efficient but to keep the emphasis that it is not only one it is one and no - and you know that we have already discussed about that there are differences so he says he come Eva a tedium in the beta in the children the another the great path of the Hindus there also the mother she's telling Equis Baha Maya otra VT Akamai of mama para we're at the to the Creed of Shura the very forceful person but he was not able to fight with the mother the mother out of herself coming out with so many different forms as the Ashura came with a big numb the soldiers group and they were all fighting fiducia soldiers when they were fighting so many of them with only one lady they never thought she is only one and why we should fight so many but the wind she herself became many then though she were told this is not the law of the war that one should fight with one and why you are so many at that time in Chandi the great mother the divine mother she commented like this ich liebe hum otra my imatra me I'm only one here do et Akiyama para Det a double two are more than me more than one where did you find in the pub 20 in the Veda always indication it is one then if it is one where from all this game the same God same power we have discussed it again and again in the Sunday discourses that the same God is becoming in different form and philosophers they are differentiating because of the explanation but we know everything is one and we find in the issue Phoenician I am coatings because Salam o Krishna casually said that and sometimes people who were reading the gospel oh that is his realization no it is his feeling no it is the realization authenticated by the Veda Upanishad the Hindu never accept anything unless it is authenticated by the Veda so that he refined in the Upanishad it says yes to serve Ronnie bhutani Atman even worse Shetty sarva bhootheshu cha aathmaanam thatho na vijugupsathe but once ramakrishna told that you cannot deny even a wicked person and in the issue punished at one of the famous Upanishad a part of the Veda it says yes to serve an evil tani he who sees all beings in the self yes - he who serve on EBU tani all beings among eva unappreciative unappreciative means sees anatman at the same time said of a booty cha aathmaanam and they are within the art man and within them also are if one realizes in that way then he feels no head great how can he but that is called a him shall the great word ahimsa that has been used again and again in our scripture particularly the Buddhists they propagated this I am sir I am sup Rama Dharma paramo means I used Dharma means righteousness this is the greatest the path of religion what I him son but what is I am Tsar this is the definition of I'm sir we find in the issue Punisher and it says in the sixth verse of the chapati should says one who sees the Hartman within everyone and again everyone within that a Hartman that means without that Hartman nothing remain so that is called that or him say he can never eat now there are our that 24 December is approaching so naturally people are decorating their houses with the beautiful the lights and also many varieties of lights we have also decorated outside and naturally it is wonderful but all the lights different color different shape different way they are burning some are blinking some are just giving the light the different yes they are then again if you ask are they truly different no because all of them are having the same electricity the same way we can say that all these people that you see all the beings that you see all different of course name and form are different but again they are not because in every being there are consciousness and that is the most precious part of that be the body and the activity and outlook everything are different that is not important the important thing is that consciousness if the consciousness is not present in a most beautiful body nobody will go and look at that beautiful body why that is the consciousness that is the most valuable thing so they have they say that if you see all beings in their self a self is that consciousness Manu the lawgiver of the Hindus he is also telling sarva bhootheshu cha aathmaanam cerebral boot on each of harmony some emotion at mahadji who are adjudicated the same way here he used the word Swaraj a sahaja means moksha liberation he gets the liberation who who sees suribabu tissue in every being at mana and then all being in the Atma same way as the Upanishads telling same teaching some emotion he sees the same sighted one the moment you become same say dear friends you must be remembering a two to three pages before when we were reading someone are singing trailer key was singing and the word came some other  WA the moment that word came sadhana Krishna went into ecstasy into Samadhi and from that stage he was coming down and he was uttering some other to us another shift one same sightedness same sightedness it is very very difficult if you are noticed that the prayer that you usually the Ramakrishna is they sing the followers of ceramic isne that was composed by shamim Vivekananda and there also it says Taji jockey Kulemin TRG giving up Jyothi the races cooler your own family lineages Hmong all your ego all these things you have to give up if you want to realize this sometimes some of our devotees some of our even the monks they make mistakes and that is the great great mistake the moment you are going on thinking that is why one monk should not remember their pre monastic life if the constantly people are reminding them the Bremen astok life is very difficult to come out of that and they was immediately that if you are a rich man son are highly educated or you are having a certificate of very the famous University apparently you may say oh no no nothing I have given a bird inside you feel comfortable to tell people I am from this University and all others will immediately with big eyes will look at oh my god he is from this University he was so intelligent and see he has given up the what he has given up he has not given up the basic thing that is his ego so the person who is telling that he has not understood and those who are appreciating they have also not understood the basic thing for God realization is this you have to forget particularly those who are hundred percent sincere and dedicated to realize God this is the basic thing and that's why in the moment you get the sannyasa they changed the name and the lineage we will forget in the name of your father and mother of course forget means not in that way but at the same time your whole lineage goes to this tree so that is the way we have to understand otherwise SWA Raja motion it is impossible majority of our people they study the bhagavad-gita six chap Ghita 29 30 and 31 versus all are speaking about this Muhammad one Tantra is a completely different we have quoted from the Upanishad and now from the Tantra Mahon even country's famous book of the Tantra it says cerebrum brahmani sarvatra brahma puri pashyati demons are evil now he's using the word such colo such Kola and that is they call the cooler Cola that means highest stage the tundra sadhana sekolah highest in Egypt under sadhana and not only that he's using the word of the Vedanta Jeevan Mukta now some Shia there is no doubt when one sees the brandman everywhere there was a great soul and used to live almost in a cremation ground bomb our Kappa and Kappa means people this to think how one person can live in that place where the people are burned all the time and dirty Ismail how can he be there this bomber Kappa he was a great soul and some of the stories about his life they say when a lady and her husband has gone the bomber kappa it was very difficult for him to find out who is a man and the woman the lady or a gentleman no differentiation in his life he could not find that differentiation is all same as the mother's that has become these and there no differentiation some other shift wa that is called the bamaca but he was also the follower of Tantra and that same Tantra when it reaches to this same sightedness his day gave the title the cooler and here called such Kola highest standard and also we find in the Manu SWA Roger that means the moksha and issue Upanishad it says that you are the some other she so this everywhere we find the same type of knowledge which realized and propagated by Sri Ramakrishna and ceramic is news telling some other stick to you see one cannot exclude even a wicked person that is called some of the sick then afterwards trail of curse and now it was a very good singer he was going on singing and some of the songs young Krishna liked very much and you know after hearing one song he is telling addressing to raluca how touching your songs are they are genuine only he who has gone to the ocean can fetch its water how touch it is they can go and fetch its water when someone is chanting it's not easy because with those words the Sanskrit or whatever language it may be when actual emotion dedication is mingled with those words and of course realization which this word mean all the hearers all around they will feel it they will fill the that type of emotion otherwise entertainment so many people are thinking so many people are chanting hundreds of CDs and cassettes are available and with the wonderful background music people are singing all of them mostly entertainment but when seriousness to sing we recommend is to sing that was completely different and cinema Christian is expelling a story there over a gentleman he is to just sing when used to go on repeating the mantra Gayatri mantra when used to repeat the Gayatri mantra without any sound people could see that whole body his his own body his conscious completely transformed all the hairs on the body is standing on end and we need to do that in a loudly anyone around we were hard immediately got the transformation that is called the power of world power the pure world the one is going on repeating the name of God taking the name of God constantly consciously I am taking the name of God and surely whole personality will be transformed surely to transform and it will take the form of that God see Ramakrishna if the trailer key is a blessed one just through song he has risk that only he who has gone to the ocean he's telling let me see you have must have fared otherwise how could you bring that type of feeling through the words can fetch it water the singing tip came to an end the master engaged in conversation with the devotees master God alone is the master and again he is the servant when we read the gospel and I was suggesting some people read the gospel oh we have completed what next book so it is not like that you have to go every word very carefully first you read complete second time third thing the more you are reading the more deeper deeper meaning is coming out one of our great Swamiji was a great scholar in Sanskrit and when he joined the order some awakened say there is an achievement marshal a domani Devi she told it is just like the skull that elephant asked ivory and that is also decorated with very costly colonies it's like that is not only ivory itself is costly and again it is decorated with so that was the Swami will became up to a specific and one of our Swami ji young Swami he was very fond of reading scriptures and he took mantra diksha from him and opted to serve him and then he noticed that the Swami is not reading any spiritual book except this gospel the one day it was impossible for him to why this Swami is reading only this gospel when I told you not a great scholar but I don't find that he was reading that kanesha's or anything while you are reading the gospel then he said if there is any differences between the Phoenicians and the gospel I will accept gospel it mean when he should make mistake but gospel make any mistake and the more and more you are realizing you're practicing meditation taking the name of God your mind is becoming pure mind is becoming subtle to understand the subtlest thing it's not just you go and read the mind should be pure pure fide then only to be easy for you to understand the subtle thing so see Ramakrishna he's telling God alone is the master and again he is the servant so whatever he was telling just before the same continuation in a different way he is mentioning the servant and the master of the same how because in everyone both servant and the master having the consciousness that is that this attitude in indicates perfect knowledge this perfect knowledge the other day we were discussing about after the realization is it not the same knowledge that dawns to everyone no because it is all different how you understand how much deeper you have gone but also depend on that so Brahma be drama be very on Rama be barista all this type of stages are there so all of them they are realized Brahman but at the same time depth of that ceramic is me is telling the master and the servant are the same when this type of knowledge comes then is called perfect knowledge at first one discriminant not these not these this is the part of the Vedanta if you have to realize the brandman then you have to negate the egg world neatly neatly not these not these that is the part of Vedanta negation negation and then you reached the goal in the beginning it is all right then it says and feels that God alone is real and all else is illusionary afterwards the same person finds that it is God Himself who has become all these the universe Maya and the living being first negation and then affirmation the bin the fruit for instance includes Flay flesh seeds and shell you get the flesh by discarding the shell and the seeds but if you want to know the weight of the fruit you cannot find it if you discard their shell and the seeds if you like to know that all of the creation then you have to take both this is the speciality of ceramic ISNA first of all reach the in device' Buhl's a chit Ananda and then coming down look at the universe this is some Anaya we don't we know there in the Vedanta school there are six schools at the air and always the people say it is cable Advaita only at the pure Advaita that's a school of Shankar Acharya and that school again is in the higher stage that I think in the coming Sunday we will discuss about that go to father his view a jar the word not jar Tahiti or charter it is not borne it is not there there is the highest form of Atlanta and we'll be discussing about that but see Ramakrishna saman I read and this summer may evident he takes everything it's not the origin but again it is not shank Gudivada this salmon nya is really completely special that's why premier awakened the who was launched against this and Saddam Oh Krishna is to ask him why don't you read a little from this book no no no no this book only says about that I am God and it is blasphemy I'm not going to read that book as a sinful words are there so now I should told that you are not reading for yourself you're only reading for me I can't read you just read and I'd like to listen to that at the Atma Ramayana there's the highest Vedantic book and just because the Rama Krishna is asking the young not in he used to read and while reading the thoughts is - entered into him and afterwards by the touch of his guru he realized that each and everything is nothing but the consciousness you know those stories in their lives so this is Ramakrishna be waken on the daily lived and propagated saman I have a Rhonda everything is nothing but the same God you cannot say no to anyone first to reach the satchitananda by negation then come down and see the universe it is very much there but in what form satchitananda he has become that he will then find that everything in its manifestation it is God alone who has become everything the world by no means exists apart from him on the basis of this knowledge shall me be vacant and very plain language you see each soul is potentially divine each soul he never said only Hindu he never said only Brahman he never said only those who have learned is nothing each soul is potentially divine and the goal is to manifest this this this then here this is called after realization you come down and you are living in this world but just think of it you're only seeing God everywhere enjoying the divine play of God and different mood different form different name same God you know him and that way you're enjoying that is called jeevan mukta the liberated why living Shankar Acharya is giving the stress on that liberated while living there's a another the school is there who says no problem you can go ahead slowly slowly you will be liberated chroma Mukti chroma and by stages you'll be moved up and you have got the human body you have got a good guide a teacher and then you have practiced your mind is to some extent purified okay next time for the another better another better like this you go ultimately you'll be the God our goddesses and then from there you will be mocked a you'll be liberated Upanishad also stresses like that your child may need at a certain Thomas T now JT her abated multi velocity here and now you must realize if you cannot do that there's a great loss and what to realize one among meaning that so the first time when salam o krishna having the dialogue with the master ma che he was asking him what do you think about your wife is she Gani organic master ma she could not understand that question and he said no she is good but up gaining not understanding what is Gannon Organa is it organic immediately see ramakrishna rebuked him and said and you think you were again master master in water I'm going to because I have learned everything in those days the ami the master degree from the University does that was the highest the educational certificate that you could get and he was a naming but see Ramakrishna said to no one is gonna and to think that there are many is Ayana the Gianna and again knowledge and ignorance here he's telling all elements finally margin Akasha and again at the time of creation Akasha evolves into Mahad and from the mohab into Ankara and in this way the whole world system is evolved it is the process of evolution an involution a devotee of God accepts everything he accepts the universe and is created being as realized in device will succeed on under but the Jogi paths are different he does not come back after reaching the Paramatma the supreme goal he becomes the United with it the yogi are totally different their mental the statuses somehow we draw the mind from the objects and reach to the goal after reaching the goal there is no nothing for them to do Keys by which they can come down all these nasty things we don't want so by that way see ramakrishna he is telling Yogi's cannot do that the partial no limits God to one object only he is not telling the ignorant people he's telling partial knower and you can remember Shami become the same man troubles from lower truth too high wherefrom he'd learned all this from saddam krishna and cinema krishna's telling partial noah he has understood god in this only in this form if you go to any people and they will say this is the only thing and they form a card either surrounding one person or one ideology or one god they said this is the only thing all the files that is going on in the name of religion because of this narrowness partial knowledge they have not understood the complete this partial limits the god to one object only he thinks that God existed in anything beyond they cannot think about that that it is God can be somewhere else also why not there are three classes of devotees now see Ramakrishna he is classifying the lowest one says God is up there all the time we'll be looking at the sky God is up there that is he points to the heaven the mediocre devotee says the God dwells in the arts of inner controller he lives as the inner controller and the highest devotee says God alone has become everything so he's a gunny he's a the knowledge that it dawned but at the same time he's a devotee why if you read that definition of bhakti and by Shandilya or by narada the knowledge Shankara is also telling what is bhakti the bhakti or devotion is to find out in totally your own self and but the highest devotee says God alone has become everything all that we perceive is know so many forms of God then he is mentioning nor Indra the young boy used to come and say Lombok is news to tell see the whole things are nothing but God Salameh Krishna respected person or in the didn't say anything but used to go and talk with other people look at that man what he says he says everything is God and sometimes used to say all all these things that has become God this pot has become God and that glass has become God and everything is God and used to love remembering there see Ramakrishna is also laughing all doubts disappear when one sees God this is the realization of Sri Ramakrishna it is one thing to hear of God but quite a different thing to see him a man cannot have 100% conviction through mere hearing but if he beholds God face to face then he is wholly convinced and here we find in the famous katha upanishad beat the day they are Gandhi Jayanthi cerebus and Shia she until judge Shekar money the shman Drishti per hour a the one which is everywhere if you realize that and there is there'll be no doubt nothing will be there so that is the realization so we find in this and formal worship drops away after the vision of God it is certainly that revealed to me is Ramakrishna is mentioning those who have read the biography of Swami Vivekanand you know that how he used to worship Ramakrishna his brother disciples dish to worship at all the natural way they have the mantras and sister Bogardus to go and meditate and he will take all the flowers together and give it rock and all the foods and he'll offer to tackle that's all but he'll meditate for two three hours before doing that and then he becomes sadhana pitch to himself and offering that food that is Vivekananda we are worshipping when we were young and it may mostly from Advaita semiotic assume there was no training of puja in the training center you must have to learn the basic puja wind is to ask our teachers Ayur to do that then you wish to tell them and we will do it in the form in the way of Swamiji from it is puja the shaman is puja you can do but before that three hours meditation do that after three hours meditation then only you can offer the one leaf flower if not then do as it is read only so be weakened under his transform and we know that how Mars or Adama Devi who was so particular she also used to cook food and then offer to God any place even one day when she cooked her food in an ardent pot that broke and most of the rise that was cooked the fell on on the mod and from the top she was collecting and telling how what to do I cannot cook again see that all the boys are very hungry all are tired now if I again go for cooking it will be too late today somehow you manage it and that she offered to talk who can you imagine and that if you feel the truck alone you can say like that so ceramic isne he became and he's giving the teaching and we feel and we see the application of all those in the life of Swamiji and mother it was suddenly revealed to me that everything is pure spirit Ramakrishna is mentioning suddenly revealed to me the utensils of worship the altar the doorframe all pure spirit main animals and other living beings of pure spirit this is the highest stage of realization and that is called
