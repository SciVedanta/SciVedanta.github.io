[185. Panchama Veda 185 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna : Paths to God : Affirmation & Negation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27aOlF9-TIs)

dr. jeevan KO be rewritten Calma shop 703 Martin would be good bully dodging our surround is not we're talking with the devotees saved both bhakti-yoga and IANA yoga advanced by rich you can realize him the God so this is the unique way the combination of all the paths the ones Lankesh to himself practiced and again and again he is propagating that this is the first time in the spiritual or we can say someone is speaking in this way every confidence why because he himself a struggle he himself has realized both the paths are true now if we analyze this the first criteria for both the paths is understanding another bhakti-yoga and the Gyana yoga first is understanding what is the understanding this world which is multifarious attraction and aversion is not the goal so that is the first understanding because we are baby Durr because of these so many things that are happening and we give our life for a little thing of this world which is so temporary so obviously when that first conception comes then only the mind turns towards God otherwise they don't think about so he is talking with the devotees those who have already fulfilled this criteria that this world is not a permanent thing the world is not my goal my goal is totally different this thing we must keep in mind otherwise sometimes just out of curiosity we open the book and we gospel of the ramp is not or any Scripture we read and then we say something else no there is nothing not in that way we have to understand that I have understood this truth at least in this life that this world there are many many good things that the air bags are also there but the system purity so this is not my goal second is the field there is God or the Brahman the God for the path of devotion Brahman for the vast knowledge so God and determine these are the two it is the that is the fate why I say faith because people before realization nothing the trait unless and until we are realizing his only failed we are only believing and nothing else so this is the second thing that faith after unconvinced the decision the world has nothing to do with me I am NOT going to do anything with it this is final second step I am going to go to God or from man so that is the faith that it exists some third is a fourth when I think that there is God I have to take up the effort I have to do something otherwise well how I reach I know the capital of America is Washington DC this is the knowledge and people told me this that geographical book is telling that history is telling that this I know but still it's a fail because I have not visited now I have to have the effort what I have to purchase the ticket of some transport or I have to drive the car to reach over there this is the effort I shall follow the path of affirmation uh torokhtiy I shall follow the path of negation that is Guiana so this is the effort on my behalf and for a constitution about the path and the goal so friends this is the problem the millions and millions of people who are trying to realize God having some conception of God or some divine idea but as our ideal is not clear Constitution is not clear about the path and the goal which is know where whole life we are doing something or other reaching nowhere so this is the thing that we have to understand either conception about the fact and the goal no problem about the Gianna the battle negation maintenance our motto affirmation et et but uh damn about that battle should have to have clear indication we will read from the pages of the gospel of Salaam o Krishna which is poor 82 83 84 wonderfully he has explained about this now we find about here he says the part of knowledge he is mentioning over here the path of knowledge and discrimination is difficult indeed and he said Brahman cannot be described in words the ceramic Krishna is speaking actually truly the pedantic terms Brahman cannot be described in words why because it is not it Journal of Agartha as they call it that we can understand we can know you cannot know it to know the time causation all these things and necessaries beyond that we cannot reach over there this is a very very certain conception which few people can understand not that it is not there not that people cannot people can do but very subtle conception it is there but your eyes cannot see it your hand cannot touch it Tom cannot express it so Delta that way is very very certain because it is beyond time space and causation but is still there so Shri Ramakrishna stilling Brahman cannot be described in words Brahman has only been indirectly hinted indirectly hinted at by the scriptures when one speaks about now you listen to this word perfect' pedantically sera monasteries explaining cowherd village on the ganges one directly states that the village is situated on the bank of the Ganges ceramic kitchen is indicating the pedantic the way of explaining things the selection on the lectionary is indication the Vedanta will speak about the Brahmin how three indication because you cannot readily speak about it the indication is there and this indication means you have to have the intellect to understand it otherwise you won't hear the three stages of indication one is jahil leshawna leshawna meas indication the fastest job the jihad means discarding the direct meaning accepting implied meaning the cowherd village is on the ganges list it cannot be Ganges River the village cannot be on the Ganges is on the bank of the Ganges so direct meaning in the river but it is not possible so we discard that take indirect meaning that is called jahil luck Sharna then comes alcoholic Sharna direct meaning is not completely given up but the real meaning is intended and thought come jihad jihad luck Shanna the previously we have already discussed in details about the luck Shanna here also I give the hint introduction so this lucky Sheena that Salam o Krishna is indicating and true that we can reach to the Brahma and again we will come to that she says why shouldn't man be able to realize the formless Brahman he must be but it is extremely difficult she cannot if he has even the slightest trace of worldliness he can be directly aware of Brahman in his inmost consciousness only when he renounces all sense objects for taste smell touch and sound and only when his mind completely stops functioning and they do when his mind stop functioning how the mind is working on the basis of the collection of information of our senses the minds work on that only the eyes goes and bring back some rapport and through the touches to the smell through the sound like that way it goes on so obviously if the mind is not getting the feedback from the senses then what happens is stopped functioning the what is meditation meditation means stop functioning of the mind how it is possible we give only one idea to the mind and force the mind compel the mind to stick to that one idea and that is called Saguna Brahma or the Brahman our God with epithets and the mind is concentrated on that and when we are perfected on that we go to near Pune Dhyana meditation without the object then where the mind is going to the soul so it is that joy the feeling of joy the test of joy that is I don't know what those who are trying to meditate to control the mind they can only understand how it goes how difficult it is even even the object in front of the mind we cannot concentrate that's why Hindus they have developed the images and the pictures so many gods and goddesses and so many things why only one object to control the mind we start the rituals rituals are wanted to support that function that goal the through the rituals we go to that when to give the instructions to the disciples we always say then inside the mind you should develop that slowly slowly were washing the feet of the guard and then decorating and then feeding the guard and these this is why because of the mind it needs some activity and we interactivity and when the activity is continuing slowlyslowly mind is withdrawn from the external world and then right after a slip past if we go towards inside the mind and finally we see nothing but the light hundred marches into that light but that light when I am marching it gives me tremendous joy so after field moments when I come out of the meditation the only thing that remain in my mind is the javac' and that gives me tremendous freshness also and that is the meditation ceramic Krishna study following the path of ghana ultimately what will happen he will have a knowledge what is that knowledge a CT it t is there is not that he will immediately realize that brahman only that consciousness will come realization will come confirmation will come it is there what is that consciousness so immediately the pundit who was there he quoted from the scripture this Ramakrishna is telling in order to realize God a devotee is going to the devotee he means I will start rare which are you know I am just indicating is not going in details the one is notion are which are the Russian are through the luxury we can have the conception that Brahma and the giba are the same the first jahil then agile than John agile there's Charles giving an agile accepting we combine that then we get the true meaning talk to our Massey so talk to our Massey he were that Brahmin but how I will know that I have Brahmin the Vedanta particularly hard wait a bit hunter they keep the steps this is the way if you can understand you are true that so that Brahmin is consciousness the cheaper me is also consciousness so naturally the both the consciousness at the same the dat way we can understand that we are the same jarl agile Rukhsana OCT consciousness is the how to understand that a boost a tray of ajar what is the opposite of tread jagran sadhna and sousou t these are the three condition of mind this is called of a star condition condition the mind jabbered our body and mind completely happy then sadhna body is absent is lying down date but mind is acting sooo suti body and mind both are inactive when both are inactive when there is the presence of the body there is no presence of the mind then how it is possible that I can say I was sleeping with the guy who reported me that is called a CD it must be there the consciousness must be there otherwise how can you it so all the lashana that this is the way we reach over there so this is the part of Ghana we can understand it so difficult all people can do it this is not possible for the ordinary people the constantly you have to go on thinking about that pondering about that meditating on that constantly you have to think that this is the consciousness which is active not the body not the mind something is beyond so that is not now sluggishness coming to the another path and he is telling that in order to realize God a devotee should make use of a particular attitude now in the beginning I was telling that we should have the effort and we should have a clear idea about the effort what's the effort to activities to reach to the goal what is the goal either God or Brahman and now if we are trying to reach to the Brahman which is the goal of the Gianni's the path of knowledge he should practice that luck Sharna I was sorry of each other and that all those and here the devotees which is the goal is the God then he should take up some attitude towards God what's the attitude here cinema Krishna said he do I am going to realize God who can stop me so that is the here agree he never bothers about anything second comes the frame shahe shall cure I've got the friendliness with the God all the time having the company of God and very happy having that company the third comes that handmade Darcy ha so that is made mainly the women the practice that and just with the mother Holy Mother helping only mother in different way so this is the way we are reading the book and thinking that we constantly remembering there a feeling the unity I am with the mother in the company of the mother serving mother also baths and as a child the child has only one thing complete filled father is there mother is there I need not to do anything if I am hungry mother knows and just called mother mother if we'd be father we'd protect me so what do you nice only fate and nothing is for the child so I am a devotee I like to realize God and I take the attitude of it child what should be my behavior completely simple that depending on God and nothing else and I mean I made Darcy I mean the company of the Divine Mother of God whatever I have to I am doing at the behest of the mother or a friend or a hero so this attitude I had to take between the bhakti is a secure that sir but some etc so these are the attitudes we should take moneymoney when they were undressing in this he said only then one can feel attached to God he's just commenting not understanding I think the seriousness with which Saddam business setting this Tennessee Ramakrishna for many days I chased the feeling that I was a companion of the Divine Mother why he is disclosing this because money money without practicing anything he simply commented what only thing one can feel attached to God I do not have you ever practiced this is the problem with the devotees you will find that any new person has come in the Ostrom immediately those who are old they will go on giving a lot of advisors to the stretchers why do they think that we know it how do you know have you ever practiced those things that you are telling you are making more confused the time of ceramic Krishna in the presence of that holy company and Salama peace to the God himself this type of people money burned it was a rich man so he thought that I have right to comment he commented some distant didn't ask him to stop that's the beauty of ceramic vishna he is immediately in an indirect way telling I don't know how the money Malik understood it or not but we should understand this we have known right if you are not practicing ceramic dish to immediately say he said he had take an attitude when he will accept then only we can get the company of God transition without protesting oh you don't know nothing he said nothing like that that is the beauty of a person not hearty but rectifying in a very different ways if I practiced many years for many days I chased that the feeling that I was a companion of the Divine Mother I should say and handmade removing the blissful mother this is ceramic dish tony reedus gospel we become more nice person how to deal with others how to behave with others some close minded people they can but what will be our attitude see how the ama krishna stealing some soul now is giving the whole distinctions of different type of people some souls realize god without practicing any spiritual discipline they are called new city eternally perfect apparently they are not ability but they have realized God which means they have done it in the past life so they have realized God in this life is nothing it was in their only the manifested yet those who have realized God through austerity japa and the light are called sadhana cynthia the fastest needles in the eternally birth then comes sadhana city they have tried and then got perfected perfect residual discipline and then there are called proposing their perfect through the divine grace pre power signal these last may be compared to a room kept dark a thousand years which becomes light the moment lamp is brought in that is called three positive so we are city demons perfect done is realized and it may be in India it merely Sadhna it may be gripa then for Tata center suddenly he becomes a there suddenly attain God vision their case is like that of a poor boy who was suddenly found favor with rich men at a rich man marries his daughter to the boy and along with her gives him land house carriage servants and so forth this is called atrocity there's a man family and the gentleman was fabulously rich and he was having three daughters and he married to the intelligent but tall so that he knew they won't lead the his orders the wipes and condition was the property within the name of my daughter you can be there you can enjoy as her husband if she passes a bit before you then it will belong to you I know one of such person and I was wondering how this man could become so rich very cruel type of person very cunning and he was never giving any donation to anyone not even when he used to visit never brought demons or sweetmeats also in that salon though he was very rich so afterwards I came to know and then I hope this is actually our opposite there certain he became just because he married that very rich man's daughter so he has become rich but a behavior it's not a Socratic the behavior is just like the poor person else genetic people at different time so here's the Amish is suddenly attainder mission is giving the example the poor boy get the favor of the rich man there are still another class of devotees softness India who have had the vision of God in a dream softness in one of the great Swami he got the he he was here in America he got the vision in dream of Shama vivica and when he was very young afterwards he came to Bethel part and maybe begun on the passed away before there he wished to believe Martin told Maha purush Marge was there I have seen this dream is it true immediately the mother mercy he was suffering a sick deal of course that is true and you have realized God so that was the softness it did salindra the way the target is telling like this and of the devotees were very close to tackle the surrender particularly was very close to target any study let us go to sleep them because softness is there if you see that the in dream we can get there let us go to sleep then we shall wake up and find ourselves babu's bubbles means ancestor plates saddam a stir tenderly there also is not asking him not to use the word in that way because he is giving the wonderful picture so this is the problem when you are talking with the people if they are not seniors then it is very difficult but it's not krishna's patience he is easy to love the stranger so very tenderly is telling you were already about Solyndra was a deputy I mean a very rich man so you were already a bobble Bobble means I just took it and you need not to worry about that then he said the need to sit there is in a class apart it was very difficult like the Swami Vivekananda there are nick disappears and all that we see their practices only for us then he is giving the example they are like the pumpkin pie first fruit then the flower usually all it comes first flower and from that comes the fruit and for them it is first fruit the pumpkin is that point it is smiling at the illustration pumpkin illustration master there is the instance of Ranade he is the nick disappear while writing the letter God he should stream of Tears go means the Krishna he remembered the Krishna he was a devotee the moment he wrote that word immediately he went into trance his bill started meditating on the Krishna the master was pleased with the peninsula moved him he praised him to the devotees and he is telling he has such a nice nature to the star Krishna he knew how to inspire people direct them towards the positive way so he is sitting here is such a nice nature you find no difficulty in driving an L into a mud wall borrowed its point breaks if you try to drive it against the stone that those who are very very egoistic they will never learn anything but those who are solved Jane mean Salaam preached is comparing their mind as the Marvel you can nail it very easily and is continuing in this way Bundy but one thing heartache article crew dials now a vision is giving the example it's a hard wall later coke Rhode Island back but the crude oil you can break it can touch the baby big Cobra is very soft all it's nothing master what good is there in reading a whole lot of structure this is Saddam occasional not that is not asking us to read the scripture but what is the purpose of reading the scripture that is telling if you are trying to understand God read and then immediately take up a bath and try to follow because life is short you do not know what is going to happen when so that is the yearning that's why I was telling the clear conception about the bath and the boom if you don't have the conception of goal that I have to realize god I have to realize Brahman and time is short I must take the direct way that is the practices I notice the practice purifying the mind how to redefine the mind taking it away from the worldly things worldly thoughts worldly actions how it is possible giving all the action at the feet of your God are one on was to I'm giving it at your feet mentally every moment you are offering it to God what happens good and bad cannot touch you so you are doing everything in the normal way but at the same time nothing can touch you that's right Bhagwan Shree Krishna asked Arjuna MA a new smaller you Dutcher the way we are reading the Gita seven hundred verses again and again we are repeating but if we know only this half is local you remember me and do your daily duties remember me and go and work mom honest mother you too Joe I go on remembering being that I am till back everything that is happening because of me so whatever you are doing offer it to me that much that is why Sudama krishna is telling that you need you to go on reading so much what good is there in reading a whole lot of scripture and can you complete the reading Scripture only Hindu Scripture if you try to read it is impossible only one book if you try to complete the results impossible bhagavata huge book and then there are who punishes so many punishes and their postures different ways people are explaining pokévision mean if you read then afterwards you can know how it is no more than it's not necessary so best way is to follow the paths indicated by Bhagavad serum occasion that's why whoever comes and wants to read the scripture I say go to gospel of salvation first read them have a clear mind understanding of the spiritual path then you choose anything that you like the path of knowledge going with all these so many books are there read it so the Islamic business telling what good is there in the study of philosophy what is the use of talking big now slowly at the beginning one should concentrate on God we'd fall I underlined it at the beginning one should concentrate on God with form why at the beginning why we got the fall we cannot concentrate so I talked to it one Muslim the frame kind of stealing can you concentrate that will we try to imagine Kaaba or something like that Fator that is also an image you are not supposed to isn't it into otherwise we cannot do anything at all I have to think of a star or the present at the moon like that like there's something object so there's a the king the very very intently they have introduced the images whatever image you like at the beginning one should concentrate on God we form then there are devotees who are beyond the three gunas sattva rajas tama they are eternally devoted to God like the Naruto the ceramic kitchen has said all these and remain silent for some time whatever he has saved he gave me the opportunity to digest so they can ponder then he stood upon de district said how does one get read callousness how does one get rid of callousness laughter makes me think of muscles and nerves grief makes me think of the nervous system see if you are reading particularly those were the doctors and studying the medicine and the biology you know that there are all numerological different things there the moment someone is laughing immediately your mind is going not the joy that he is enjoying and expressing through the lab rather it goes to the matter sister topic realities so the pundit is asking I cannot think of anything but the very gross thing to what to do the cinema business mining he is telling that is why najran shastri used to see the harmful effect of the study of the scripture is that it encourages renouncing and arguing so encouraging reasoning and heartbreak encourages reasoning and arguing and constantly people they feel like arguing and reasoning that is not a Shastri he was a Shastri he was also a great scholar funding is there no way for us the master is there is the part of discrimination and this discrimination the beach our because this person this one did and he was studying the scripture and debating that was his nature so Saddam addition is encouraging him to follow the path of discrimination the way lies to discrimination renunciation and passionate yearning for God this is Venetian bechara renunciation the other and passionate yearning for God these are the three things trustees which are what is that which are this word is transitory so obviously me with this body and mind this association is also transitory and I am also going to die and all this world is going to change everything is going to change this is the discrimination which are so subtle and media or is that media not that it is not there it is there but it is existing temporarily so it is not the prominent then what happens I renounce what do I even ounce my ego I should do this I must get that all that hum cover of the ego in Kiba when a evil the ego what remains passionate yearning for God realization with the beginning and dole the first thing is understanding what is that understanding there is God must be God and this world distance the religious understanding and also the faith the belief I realized God but I believe by seeing the lives of the great sages and saints their lives as the other examples the mirrors that reflecting the existence of God so that we I must do and he says the yearning understand man practices discrimination he cannot utter the right words so this unless a man is fatherly understanding he cannot see the right word now he is giving an example pundit somewhat hi there was another pendant very sweet the scholar say God is dry but his rushes sorry about the God it says Russia saruba all the joy that we see is the sources that God Russia syrup embodiment of joy and this funding without realizing God he says he is dry to cinema Krishna was not at all happy with the pundit now does anyone keep horse in a cowshed then he is giving the example everybody is smiling that means he doesn't know anything about God is not having any conception and he is giving talking about the God what happens he proves himself a completely fool but it is smiling and cinema kishna with the love then hasret also commented master you see there is no need to read too much of the scriptures there is no need to read too much of the scriptures if you read too much it will be inclined to reasoning and argue so Geeta Geeta Geeta if you go on repeating what comes they are the ugly so you understand that what you are tagging mom honest mother you deserve and exhibiting God as my master and the guide and then whatever I am doing at the behest of the god and nothing else nothing will touch you the success of failure mostly what happens when I am doing something if I am successful I am so happy the momentum my venture fails I am so unhappy people put finger on me but I know it because of the god I was doing because of the God I am successful because of the God and not successful so that we how wonderfully the mind will be calm and quiet for each and everything yes the way to realize God is true discrimination renunciation and hearing for him what kind of learning one should learn for God as the cow with earring hard grounds after its death the pundit also giving an example then the master is adding add your tears - you're early so this is the beauty of the slump is not what is the priority is clubbing the devotion with the practice of the knowledge in the path of knowledge the three states we were taking again and again is repeating the first is discrimination which are which are sought asad vichara which is permanent and which is temporary that which are along with that renunciation we go for the permanent one that is brahman the consciousness and give up the world which is temporary constantly changing and tardies yearning my a four hundred percent effort to bring it to the brahmana sudama history is adding history add your tears to yearning and if you can renounce everything through discrimination and dispersion then you will be able to see God that yearning brings about God intoxication whether you follow the path of knowledge or the path of devotion the board the main thing is you the moment you get up in the morning and say God once again one day that you are given to me every moment of it the twenty five four hours that I am going to in this day please be with me ah I am discriminating at the same time that as the Rishi's of the world Eve have bring the hidden manna pottery in a certain become dr. Bhushan a barber new subtler my enriched daily with the golden plate you are covering the face of the truth please remove it I want to get that I want to realize that face to face with the truth I like to realize the truth that is the yearning with the yearning if you can add tears what is the tear devotion devotion to the path of knowledge and this devotion means the hundred-person the time devoted to what I am doing so that see Ramakrishna said add your tears to your earning that means I'm sincere true whether in the path of devotion or in the path of knowledge I am sincere so this is the there's a great deal of difference between the knowledge of the householder and of an all renouncing sannyasi why because he has sannyasi has nothing except God to achieve true sannyasi nothing except God there is no difference between my relatives my family my country my association nothing not at all but how so he won't be able to do that that father he has the devotion yes the love but at the same time his attachment to so many things that's why the realization differs now he is mentioning about the chaitanya mahaprabhu he was endowed with both the knowledge are brahman and the extracted love of God chaitanya mahaprabhu he is anything but in the life of a human's Ram Krishna also we find the same thing the roads are present over there dewy abductor semana de cinta Bruce Jenner Berta Berta Berta Berta Cadillac Oliva odd Buddha gesture show me villain he's writing Yami Gullu Sharona Papa India he is the doctor after this war how because he is giving the medicine so that we can completely get freedom from the bondage of birth and death however India and he is having that knowledge at the doctor ah Dwyre there's not - there is only one the Brahman is one consciousness is one all-pervading some are hit the cheetah he knows it but he knew it the ordinary people who are alone understand it rather they will make it completely in a different way so provoke the perturbed at the Briton externally he is all work the mother please reveal thyself to me please listen to my prayer he is crying and beating his chest and rest practicing austerity so why because of this this is the devotion but both are their karma caliber of Buddha gesture he is the whole personality is karma he is doing it for the betterment of others no attachment at all so these three wonderful paths combined and then the moment he was united with the god yoga so all the four paths we can see very clearly in the life of an see Ramakrishna is a perfect personality so that he is telling but salam o krishna is mentioning about children no mahaprabhu and he said she was endowed with both knowledge of brahman and static love of God and to the coordinate he is mentioning one can attain spiritual consciousness through both affirmation and negation duties our topic back to realise Brahman at the God through affirmation and negation what is the affirmation everything that I see is nothing but the manifestation of my beloved my god everything is nothing but my god here the director made history Tata not the Draupadi Krishna's fully very well whatever I see is nothing but Krishna only my beloved my god the de-risk LED under negating but AM affirmative I am accepting everything as my god and similar way negation and the person is coming in - no no no this is not God is not now in the noisy noisy not this not this not this so then suddenly he feels the tremendous joy and the fearful completely free from the fear and he knows I had that problem and eternal I don't have the birth of the Dead and only in that eternal please I survive it is called the path of negative both negation and high permissions are ways to realize one and the same goal the Saddam Titian is giving emphasis again and again because there's a tremendous conflict between the path of knowledge and the path of devotion those who are devotee they don't like to accept the path of knowledge and those who are following the path of knowledge always criticize the devotees so that is the reason allocation is combining and look at it both the negation and affirmation always to realize one and the same goal Shama Vivekananda he said by unselfish work one can reach where Buddha reached by his knowledge Christ by his prayer the batter knowledge the Buddha followed but the devotion that the Christ phone you can reach over there why does the goal is the same if we understand these then at least those who are thinking in this way particularly among the Hindus this fan conflicts between the knowledge and the devotion that will be completely eradicated completely gone if you can understand this truth tubbs Ramakrishna so these three pages that I was reading in from the gospel is so important so very important those who are sincere they should understand this both negation and affirmation of the ways to realize one and the same goal infinite other appeal opinions and infinite are the waves here ceramic Easter is not stopping infinity opinions anyone can think about God and anyone can find out his own method to realize God infinite are the opinions and infinite at the ways but how I know that he has reached the goal that is one it cannot be two it is one how he'll understand that he'll be full of love and unselfishness the person made from different paths different paths to the system but the result that will be nice character is very clear what is the result pure love and unselfishness that will manifest in his life then we would say yes but you must remember one thing the injunction is that the path of devotion destroyed by Narada is the best suited to the Kali Yuga Salameh she is mentioning according to this path first camp of T then Harbor and when bhakti is mature that's problem then higher than Baba is the maja and prema the ordinary mortal does not attain mahabhava and prema she who has achieved these has realized the goal that is to say as attain God surround is nagging while preaching eliminate the head and the tail that is to say emphasis only the essentials pundit was commenting in expounding religion one has to use a great many words because I am explaining so I am quoting from here they are acceptor etc assalamu krishna while preaching eliminate hell and tell that is to say emphasize only the essentials and what is the essential god realization is the goal of every human life and how to reach to God whatever path you think that you can follow you can take up either property or again but the only thing is you must be very very sincere the yearning that for God that must be very very sincere and allowing that it or should be there I am following this path because I like it others may not follow me my path it doesn't matter because they will also realize God in their own way what it is if it is we can again and again reach out to people and tell just pick up any one thing and manifests the divinity that is within you and that divinity is love that divinity is unselfishness and make you human life full of joy peace and become a missionary peace you like wherever you go whatever you talk movie were you our meeting hall will be full of joy and encouragement and that is the final stage of religion to see Rama Krishna is teaching in this way emphasize only the essentials of the religion thank you let us conclude with this [Music] darn gum Drita being crowned by he shall birth order but ameesha media damn Ramakrishna Shira saw Shan Shan the Chandi how do you see Donna she's not
