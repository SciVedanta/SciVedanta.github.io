[390. “Who will receive the grace of God?” - Panchama Veda ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ6jJ6pQ4lU)

in the mushka so this Wednesday evening we will study who will receive the grace of God but if we can reach up to that or otherwise from the page 790 you will study now let us begin with this totra tabukatham rhytham foreign foreign the teachings the conversation The Talk that becomes like nectar how because that gives us the actual idea of spiritual life and what is the spiritual life to know the truth again what is this truth to know the knower to know the Creator so this whole process is called religion the religion actually there are different type of practices system why only to develop in the mind that conception about the reality why we talk about reality because this world is completely temporary that is our daily experience constantly everything is moving everything is changing including ourselves but at the same time we do not like to believe it we don't like to accept it when all people around us are dying our known people are dying passing away we like to believe that I am not going to die I like to survive so why this so the vedantine after great research they said this is because of the Maya from where this power of Maya has come from the God because except God was nothing there God is the only source good and bad all come from him so this is all things are so much jumbled up we are thoroughly confused that sometimes people they say forget about it let us enjoy this world as long as we are surviving so that is also another philosophy we call charbaka philosophy the only materialistic way they like to live and they like to die and they like to go away but at the same time there are some people who are constantly thinking why then we like to survive not only me each and every being they all like to live where from this notion came the characteristic came where from we know that we like to live something must be the Creator must be having that quality so that quality has come to us we like to know we like to leave we like to know and we like to enjoy no one wants to suffer so they shortlisted that oh these are the three categories first no one like to die Everyone likes eternity so the source is eternal from where we have all come second we like to know that that is the source of knowledge there's a uniqueness and finally each and every one of us we like to enjoy and for the enjoyment we have seen when we go for the materialistic object it is all temporary so we like to go back to somewhere where we will get the Eternal Joy which is called Bliss and for that we need not to depend on any object or anything in just this is the whole of religion understanding the reality and going back to the truth and what is the ultimate goal or ultimate achievement fearlessness eternity and joy eternal so knowledge existence and Bliss so they have given sat chit Ananda in Sanskrit sat means eternal cheat means knowledge and Ananda is the Joy or Bliss Ananda these are the three things is our the Creator now these Creator is all pervading it is not having any form but we are not satisfied with that so we need something to which we can approach we can talk we can pray we can fight with so the conception of God Has Come and from that God again that is also sometimes an abstract idea so we need someone who will be with us but at the same time having the knowledge and power of God so that is called Avatar so friends there are one step when we like to know only and those people those who are following the path of knowledge that is particularly spatially in Hinduism in sanatana Dharma the the path is there where they don't believe in God but they are very holy people why though they don't believe in God but they have constantly discriminating they are they are discriminating constantly we drawing the Mind from the same subjects and we when we look at them the transformation is really unique full of love full of generosity and how these changes come because of the knowledge so The Path of Knowledge but very difficult why because you don't have anything to hold on so there is no one to go and talk to some people may do it very special type of people so they are called gyani canons of their knowledge the knowledgeable people gyani and the next comes bhakta the same goal is the same but they are taking a different route different path and different type of practices so when bhagavan sidama Krishna the God himself has taken the human form which whom we call Avatar or the Incarnation of God and he is just like us as a human being and living with us growing up with us talking with us but at the same time so unique that when all people are running after the wealth name Fame physical Comfort he is going exactly opposite direction and he is full of joy so when we are running after the wealth suddenly we stop and turn back and see how come this man is so happy without anything then you stop and start thinking which side we should go go for these all 99 personal going for the money money and money after having the money they are not happy there are so many stances are there then what to eat then you stop and look at this person who is quietly sitting in one place Maybe looking at the as you call Rat Race the whole the rats are running there he is looking at this this type of people and amusing and laughing then we go to him and he goes on giving us the unique teaching and that is called The Words the teachings become Amrit the nectar those who understand that Implement that in their life follow in their life they also become full of joy so let us you know the last Wednesday I was in the a very wonderful City Charlotte and it is in the North Carolina the state of the America a very famous state and from there I gave this class and I read out all the pages and we were discussing about the karma and all that and here we will start from the page 790 from this continue continuation of the same discussion the ego seems to vanish this moment but it appears the next so why the karma why this conflict ego and what is this ego it comes from God it is a tremendous power but at the same time it has no reality what is this ego if we like to explain no one will be able to say anything but each and every one of us feeling that when I say this is north and somebody said no this is South conflict so why it is not the conflict of knowledge the conflict the ego then I am saying these and why he should not accept it like that it goes on but wow with this eye why should I have to say that whatever I have said why not stop and then listen to the other man whether his arguments and he's analysis is good or not no we don't have that patience ego so I need not to explain about ego because each and every one right from the childhood days till the before death all this ego we know what is it and these ego is separating us from God very peculiar we are gods because we are the creation of God but only we don't understand that we are God because only one thing that has God has given us that is ego and we cannot hold it those who are understand that can remove that immediately they stand face to face with that God and immediately they get fulfilled and can say I I the son of God all power all knowledge all joy eternity everything we get only if we can remove the something which is falsely holding us this ego so the discussion is going on in the Ram's house the captain has come other devotees are there the discussion is going on the ego is trying to explain it to the devotees saying it vanishes this moment next moment it appears unless the one renounces the ego one does not receive the grace of God so who will receive the grace of God when one can remove the ego so simple what is this ego eye Consciousness what is this I from here we have to analyze ourselves when I say I pointing my finger on this body does it mean these bones this flesh this blood and all this no because this body it will go after some time it will people will burn it or bury it it will be remaining over here it goes mixing with other things sometimes some of the people they will put put in a beautiful box very costly box sometimes metal box sometimes gold and the rich people whatever you do and whatever the medicine you are applying on it slowly slowly it will reduce to nothing it will go back to the sources so naturally it will be so bad smell people won't be able to stand near it and it will be so ugly looking people even the dearest one won't like to look at it this body cannot be that eye so what is this I then if not this body then what is this I oh then the mind I am thinking I am activating I am intelligent I am doing so this I is this the eye truly the mind the mind is also we have seen so many people they have forgotten everything they're leaving they're eating they're walking but they have forgotten everything they cannot recognize their own Sons daughter what about that God forbid let everybody be healthy and that type of Alzheimer should not be having any one of the devotees and no one is a terrible disease you are living in your known world as an unknown one that the person it doesn't know that he's a patient he thinks I am all right but after bathing he thinks oh have I paid I don't remember have I eaten I don't remember who is this person is my son but I don't recognize what a terrible condition you just remember imagine what a terrible condition so this is the way if we are thinking the mind is me that is terrible this mind can take me anywhere the Mind cannot be the meaning then who is this who am I that is the question the vedant in they are asking who am I KO um and this is the in Sanskrit KO aham is a unique question ayata where from have I come what is my goal where I am going to go where from have I come my father and mother has given me the birth and then I am growing and someday I will die and this is the natural way it goes every why you are asking this question just enjoy your life and what when the day will come moment will come then you die that's all now that cannot be that is not the life of a human being the human being are those who try to understand and realize the truth the man is man so long he can fight with his nature external and internal that is the way Swami Vivek on the express we have to fight with our nature what is this nature that tried to take us down always to the different types of objects worldly objects so we see something and we think oh this is the wonderful thing I should have we hear we smell we taste We Touch these are the only five things making us mad the millions and millions of people are dying but the richest of the rich people cannot imagine but they can help them they could help them they could save their life and by that way they could have enjoyed their life also they could be God the images their pictures will be everywhere in the world people will never forget them oh these are the kind people so what makes you permanent happy worshiped by many is a sacrifice that that sacrifice we have to make and what is the ultimate sacrifice the wealth the money the property no ultimate signifies the sacrifice of ego the ultimate sacrifice the sannyasa the monkhud is nothing but the preparation of sacrificing ego it's not that uniqueness I don't belong to this world because this whole world is illusory but as long as I am thinking the world is existing so when I don't think there is no world at all so these are the way they go on thinking when I am sleeping do I ever think what will happen to my building no I just forget before that before going to bed I am carefully locking all my doors and windows and checking everything everything is all right then I go to bed but when I sleep there is no house there is no room there is no property there is no Society nothing remains this is our daily experience then where we go and there we are not worried at all we are so happy why we forget ourselves the association of this physical body and the mind when you forget that so what the ultimate giving up ultimate renunciation ego that I is going on give the moment we can give that the grace of God will come what is the grace of God because ego is separating us from God we are in reality God and what is that God full of love all pervasive all-powerful all compassionate anything good that we can imagine or God and that ultimately it is full of joy there is no sorrow in God cannot be so when we become God ourselves sometimes some people may say oh this is blasphemy how a sinner can become God who is sinner I didn't do any pro anything any I didn't commit any sin God has given me the ego from the point of view of the Hindus I didn't ask him to give but he gave me now that is his play and in the play he taught me that you have to overcome the ego the barrier that I have given you you have to scale it you have to overcome it and then you have to remove the ego I gave you the ego at the same time I have given you the teaching how to remove the ego didn't die I gave it through the scripture I gave it through the holy people I myself at vented as a human being and taught you and if you don't learn it then suffer so this is the way if we can see from the point of view of the dualistic don't mix it up with the modest non-dualist the honest approach is different but they are little another different type of people but now the dualist those who cannot think of that I am that God well for them God has given me ego and separated me from God result suffering anxiety a different type of problems okay and God has come as the rishis as the holy teachers as the gurus as the avatar to teach me how to remove the ego here at this moment bhagavan sirama Krishna he is giving us the technique to go beyond the ego he is God himself he has given us the ego and also the teaching how to remove the ego and if we learn it then who is going to be benefited me if we don't who is going to suffer me so it depends on me this is the game and as long as I concern is there then bhagavan's ramakrishna will give different type of example so who is going to get the grace of God the blessings of God we call him in in Indian language in Sanskrit creeper who is going to receive the grace kripa means grace of God those who have removed the ego otherwise not so this is very the condition is very clear the grace of God will come on us we if we can remove the ego of course a little bit of things that oh God I am having this problem please save me from this problem that comes because of the prayer the power of prayer and when you are praying sincerely so obviously God is not a stone thing it is the leaving it can understand it can feel it can hear that's why bhagavan's ramakrishna said I truly promise to you God is there anyone can see God talk to God this is a leaving something very close to us and it depends on our mind why we can't see it because our mental vibration is not going up to that the moment our vibration where our mind will be that level immediately we will understand or this is God and why we cannot again the calm three later world but terrible word ego at this is going on Suppose there is a fist in a house and the Master of the House puts a man in charge of the stores as long as the man remains in the store room the master doesn't go there so the master so we have to understand the meaning in between the line so ramakrishna is giving an example the Master of the House has employed or given in charge a person to look after the store that means the ego he has given now as long as that ego now the man in charge of the store actually the ego he is explaining in that way who has given the chart God the Master of the House has given charge to a person to look after the store here we have to understand the God has given ego to a person second line as long as the man is there in the store room the master won't go there now if we continue with that ego the God's grace will not come third when that person who was given the church lived that per place the master himself will go and take care of the store when the ego that was given to us by God and we say thank you very much in this Thanksgiving Day we need not to give us ego we don't need the ego and the God will be happy okay I will take charge now if we consider this body as a storehouse store room and someone the master the God has given me the church that this is your body this is your mind this is you and my ego is sitting over here God will never come the master will never come now when I say enough is enough for a long period of time I am here oh God no more so I am leaving who this I the ego when they goes away then naturally what remains only God God comes and fulfills so this way if we can understand the beautiful ways ramakrishna giving us the main teaching you have to give up the EGO as long as the man remains in the storeroom the master doesn't go there but when his own will when of his own will he renounces the storeroom and goes away then the Master locks it and takes charge of it himself when we give the ego then thus serve the jivatma the individual soul he God God himself will take charge of that so who received the grace the blessings when we give away our ego a guardian is appointed only for a minor a boy cannot save gerd is for party therefore the king assumes responsibility for him God does not take over the responsibilities unless we renounce our ego in the externally when we see that a minor has been given that's because minor cannot take responsibility so the king is giving at assuming the responsibility God does not take over our responsibilities unless we renounce our ego now here we means that minor the minor a child he's not having any ego he doesn't know actually so who is taking care the king and me if I become just like that minor oh God I do not know what to do what shall I do now God's grace will come so the when we are reading the gospel of sirama Krishna if you just go on reading this is a beautiful examples and like that but the truth that is hidden over here and that is the beauty you have to find it out otherwise what the ego is the main problem now the example bhagwan's ramakrishna is giving the master has given the charge of a storehouse store room to a person then the master is not visiting the storeroom because that person is sitting there now when that person of his own will Master will never say go away anywhere the own will he goes away then the master textures what is this we were talking about ego that means the God has given the ego to a person and now the game has begun again here in the scripture in the Pancham of Veda in the gospel of sudama Krishna indication is very clear you have to give up that ego over there and say sir it is enough I won't be able to perform anymore then the God himself will take Church another example minor The Miner cannot take his own decision so similarly I have to go and surrender at the feet of God and say I don't know what to do it is you who are there my protector as a king so please protect me so this is the way we can learn and now he is giving an anecdote you know that is that to explain the thing so first is the ritual in the spirituality in the religion the first is the ritual and say second is the morality third is the mythology mythology of the stories depending on some wonderful teaching some truths are there history is there and some the stories thinking and then punched up and give it to the people to understand the truth here bhagwan's ramakrishna giving us a beautiful story mythological story once Lakshmi and narayana were seated in baikunta is the place the Abode of narayana and not an as power is Lakshmi when narayana suddenly stood up Lakshmi had been stroking his feet she said Lord where are you going the narayana answered one of my devotees is in great Danger I must save him with these words he went out but he came back immediately Lakshmi said Lord why have you returned so soon now narayana smiled and said the devotee was going along the road overwhelmed with love for me some washer men were drying clothes on the grass and the devotee walked over the clothes at these the washer Mane chased him and were going to beat him with their sticks so I ran out to protect him but why have you come back asked Lakshmi narayana laughed and said I saw the devotee himself has picked up a big storm a break to throw at them so I came back everyone started laughing so what is the teaching of the story The anecdote if we are taking responsibility for ourselves God will be away and if we can become just like the baby who is lying on the lap of the mother and cannot do anything only crying and at to draw the attention of the mother then the mother will take care of the baby if a grown-up child running here and there something is happening the child is taking care of himself or herself the mother knows they will be or she will be able to understand the problem and then work accordingly mother won't be ordered and owned hell but the baby on the lab mother will be taken care so the indication is this if we give up the EGO completely and can depend on God like a baby on the lap God Will Take Care you're the man who was marched in the devotion of the narayana when there was a problem he made a mistake because he was in a closed eyes he was walking didn't notice that there are some closed uh washed clothes that drying over there he worked on that that was a mistake but when he was having the trouble immediately God was rushing to him to help but he himself became aware and took a brick to fight ego started working I am fighting back the God will go away so this is a very clear indication but friends depending hundred percent on God is really difficult if we can truly depend on God we need not to do anything God will take care of everything truly but depending 100 percent on God is just we see the life of bhagwan's ramakrishna a life completely dedicated to God it's not doing anything except the indication of the uh advice of the god or the with the will of God otherwise you you won't do anything so when we are the Salama Krishna is giving this example he himself is the example example how to depend on God and work so it's be beautifully he is mentioning I said to keshav you must renounce your ego then keshav replied if I do how can I keep my organization together now here comes friends we are discussing about the ego just as a our reminder where from the ego came from the god the God has given as the ego now the problem is as long as we are with that ego God will never come to us the grace of God will never come to us then the problems that we are facing the challenges that we are facing we have to face and we have to work with that God will never help so this is the game that is going on now God has come the avatar and then he is asking giving us the advices that if you give up the EGO you can go back to God which is the source of Eternal joy and pleas and happiness Now problem is we have got so much attached to that ego the highness I'm thinking if I am not there then who will run the organization keshav Chandra Shane you must be knowing those who were hearing the gospel of sirama Krishna you must be knowing about the keshav Chandra Shane at that time is a contemporary person of bhagavan's ramakrishna he was a very famous person now he was developing an organization a spiritual organization social and spiritual organization Brahma shamaj sadharan Brahma samaj there were Brahma samaj then breakout group now Keisha was telling that if I give up my ego how can I can continue with my organization from here we should be very attentive to understand because all of us are having some responsibilities in the household we the ramakrishna mission monks we are having so much of responsibility in this organization and we may think that oh my God why I should be bound by this who is going to take responsibility now we are having some problem with the water Connection in one of our old building that is called mother's Cottage in the Homer Glen area now I had to get the money when to get the permission and all this I'm a monk I this is not my house but I am very much concerned that I am trying to talk with the people who can help with the monetary health and also some of the devotees who can help me by with the authorities you can give the connection of the water and all that that this is a challenge this is a problem I have to collect fund I have to collect the people why should I do that then I shall give him all those up so I am free then I will take the name of God that you can if you it is possible but at the same time when you are doing it doing it for the good of many if that house can be maintained with the proper water then the devotees can come and stay and they can enjoy the life of an ashrama a spiritual life a serenity and you the monk in the vedanta society you are organizing that the devotee and the God you are organizing let these people come for the betterment of others that is exactly what Swami Vivekananda said he said that what is this life for our mission ramakrishna mission in Sanskrit beautifully coined Atman Moksha is for the liberation of one's own self how helping others to get that too means and and also for the benefit of the world now we I can simply leave and I can be alone roaming around here and there that is the life but I take the challenges why the if I can get the connection of the water and collect some fund and talk to that person and and that way then the or many devotees for many long period of time can come and stay and enjoy the life of the religion here in this asrama why should I not do that let me do that but how now the answer is coming the keshav was telling if I leave the ego my organization will go now here the problem that I placed before you people if I give up the EGO then who is going to write the application to the devotees contacting devotees contacting the authority if my ego is not there this same problem so we should have to have the ego now if I am having the ego I don't get the grace of God then if I don't get the grace of God then why should I have that why should I do that I have left my heart and home my family whole life only to get the grave grace of God now this is the very very challenging moment we have to understand it very clearly the reply of bhagavan Si ramakrishna I say to him now I read again I say to Kesha bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling to keshav you must renounce your ego how clear it is very straightforward because he is the teacher a grade one teacher because he loved Kesha and knew the keshav is going to get the grace of God if he can give up the EGO he was on the last lag of that and the last level the highest level only little removal of the ego and he is going to becoming the God himself realize God but the Kesha was having the doubt and he said sir if I give give up the EGO then who will look after the organization so how can I keep my organization together hey you do this you do that you should not do this who is going to say the organizer and if I don't say that the organization will break so all these disciplines I have to keep and when I am keeping the discipline I is remaining so this is the Dilemma what to do this is the challenge in the tapusha austerity of ramakrishna mission monks and the monks those who having the organization this is the challenge I said to him bhagavansi ramakrishna is telling to him the Kisha how slow you are to understand look at it he never attended in school and the keshav Chandra is such a learned person and he is telling him how slow you are to understand I am not asking you to renounce the ripe ego this is the only way we can save ourselves I am not asking you to renounce The Ripe ego the ego that makes a man feel he is a servant of God or he is devotee that is called ripe ego in Bengali parka Ami Ami means ego I and Paka means the ripe what is the ripeness matured I know that I am nothing but God but at this moment I am little separate from God because I am working so I am servant of God I am the Son of God daughter of God we are the children of God so that way when we are working so here SRI ramakrishna mentions servant why servant I am humble I am performing your work so when we are constructing a house where the devotees will come and stay it's not for me they are not coming to meet me they are coming to meet my master my God bhagavansi ramakrishna so who am I I am the servant the servant the word sometimes we preach or the white servant okay I am the worker I am working for God so he is telling how slow you are to understand you need not to give up the EGO which ego ripe ego what is that ripe ego I belong to God and it is God's work friends those who are coming to do the voluntary work in the asthma's if they remember this the eye belong to God and this is my God my masters the place so I am taking care all the doors are closed or not in the night and then whether all things are properly lights are put up and the heating system is properly adjusted otherwise the a b bill will come then all these things I am doing but I know this does not belong to me but at the same time I am concerned Why this belongs to my God and a time will come I will leave all this thing and I will die and go back to God again somebody else will enjoy this but still I am doing and so attentively so that is called ripe ego without ego we cannot work and without work without realization if you give up the work you are nowhere because in the bhagavad-gita again the SRI Krishna is mentioning without performing the work you cannot burn up the work you have to do that now he is teaching us giving the secret work but as a employee of the God as a servant of God servant word but I am so humble I don't take any decision the God is giving me the decision God is asking me to do it and I am doing it this is a unique way to practice austerity the spiritual austerity doesn't mean that we should go into the forest and then stand inside the water and The Rock and these there leaving in the household also but detaching myself from the ego and with ego that is ripe ego I belong to God and I am doing God's job this is a very very unique way to realize God so sirama Krishna that's why this panchama Veda the gospel of sudama Krishna is so unique so wonderful you need not to give up anything no Hearth and Home and these and that whatever you are doing do in a such a way that I belong to God and I am doing it for the god that is why he is mentioning the ego that makes a man feel that he is the servant of God or he is devotee give up the unripe EGO the underhive ego is the problem which is attest with this body and mind I means this body and mind the devata and Asura the two words all the time in Indian philosophy they say the clashes between Asura and Surah Surah means enlightened one Asura ignorant one the Asura and Surah constantly fighting you'll see that Indian mythology full of that but they are the same one ego is unripe ego attached with the body and mind another ego ripe ego not attached with the body and mind but ego that's why they are fighting otherwise why whenever we are working we have having the ego but if the ego is attached with God that ego according to bhagavan's ramakrishna then terminology that is ripe ego Paka Army and that helps us to realize God but exactly opposite kacha Army Andre ibigo attached with the body and mind that binders in this world so this is the ego is saying the ego that makes a man feel he is God's servant his child this is the ripe ego it never harms one does not harm one then the tree look the gentleman who actually or one of the the pastor of the Brahma samaj the he was there he is commenting it is very difficult to get rid of the ego people only think they are free from it three look who is mentioning we also all know is so difficult to go beyond the ego master he is giving the example trailer because it is difficult immediately is another person who was also the Contemporary person he is there the cinema Krishna is giving his example not from the scripture from the Mahabharata ramayana no from the the same Community from the same time which that person gauri the Gori was a great austere person and he was a great scholar Gori would not refer to himself as I least he should feel egoistic bhagavan's ramakrishna also never mentioned but instead of giving his own example he mentioned about the Gori the Gori was known and respected that gauri never said I pointing the finger to his body associating the body and the mind list feel that egoistic he would say this instead I followed his example and would refer to myself as this instead of I said because he's so humble you know he will always always give the credit to somebody else you'll never say oh this is my work my theory and the Gori is practicing no he said I learned from gauri so this is the humbleness he's the god he is giving that offering the flower and he is remembering who is this person I am worshiping he's the embodiment of all varieties of religions paths leading to the same goal and here the bhagavan cinema Krishna is mentioning he would say this instead I followed his example and would refer to myself as this instead of I instead of saying I have eaten I would say this has eaten Motu noticed it and said one day what is this referred further rivet father why should you talk that way let them talk that way they have their egotism you are free from it you don't have to talk like them mathur is a jamindar he is a very rich person but look at it idealized who is this bhagavan sirama Krishna and that is why he very correctly mentioned that other people say because they are afraid of their egotism you need not to bother about that you are completely free from ego you are the god yourself was giving the example I to do but again here the mathur so we find when the trailer Crusade is very difficult to practice the path without ego and sudama Krishna is giving the example of the Gori a contemporary scholar that he said like this never said I but said this then he mentioned that I learned from him and I was also doing this and he comes another example of a realized soul but he was the landlord but he realized God when the SRI ramachandra came the Lord Vishnu in the form of Sri ramachandra almost all people considered him as a son of dasharata the king never could understand that he is God himself only a few rishis and hanumanji of course here we find it is so difficult to understand the God who is living with me talking walking can you believe the god in that human form and sometimes he is angry sometimes he's shouting sometimes he's laughing just like us he's God himself realized it in the bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna is mentioning no no one can understand in this way it's so difficult to understand in Avatar and Incarnation you need to be in that level your mind should be in that high level then only you can understand otherwise we always judge according to our standard all thing that we judge according to our standard those who are really bad type of people they always still they always do these and that when they look at the monk they will oh they are doing it must be some other interest is there otherwise why they are doing they must be doing this oh they are collecting money that means they are going to enjoy that money because they do that so obviously according to our mental condition we always judge the world and others now look at the mathur Babu who was a landlord an apparently an ordinary person but how he realized and he said you need not to do like that because they are afraid that they'll be bound but you are the Creator you are the god yourself you need not to bother about that I say to keshav since the ego cannot be given up Let it remain as the servant the servant of God so who is going to receive the grace of God who has given up the EGO now if I give up the EGO I won't be able to work at all then what type of ego I should retain bhaka Army ripe ego what is this ripe ego I am doing as a servant of God when I am performing I am taking the decision but I know that I am only on behalf of God as a servant of God as a humble person and before taking the the decision I have to pray to God this is the problem has come what should I do days after days we have to pray to God then you will feel within yourself oh this is the way I should handle and constantly you have to pray to God the please hold my hand don't leave it I cannot work this is the work that I am doing for you and if you are leaving me then how can I do this I don't need to do it so that is called the Paka Army we have to do because without that we cannot survive so at the same time we should not do thinking that I am doing I am doing on behalf of God as a servant of God he is mentioning to Kesha then giving the example of the prahlada prahlada those who have read that in the mythology they know the bhagavata also the prahlada had two moods sometimes he would feel that he was God in that mood he would say thou art verily I and I am verily thou you are me and I am you I I the Son of God like that that's not the great the real eyes Soul the seed like that at the same time I am God but when he was conscious of his ego he felt that God was the master and he was the servant after a man is formally established in the ideal of I am he he can live as God's servant now the real thing has come who can truly say that I am the servant of God he who has realized God friends will stop here and we will continue from this place and in the next reading thank you so the first question is from triguna he's saying how to capture the six enemies of the mind like Karma Moksha and how to develop bhakti and faith on God you know that the how to ah give up the comma the desire and all that and that is in a prayer prayer prayer the practice first clear understanding in the vedanta they have seven steps in the very first step is the clear understanding this discrimination since you have got the first step icha the holy desire that I like to give up the desire attachment then as you were hearing the gospel or reading the gospel take the advices of bhagavan sirama Krishna and every moment whatever you are doing always say God I am doing it because of you on your behalf please don't leave my hand please guide me what should be the right path and by that with the constant prayer your mind will be purified and God's grace will reveal over there is the only path thank you so he is asking what is the purpose of the Maya World why did God create the Maya world or is it our own ignorance that creates the Maya world see those who are following the path of gyana the knowledge they say this is our ignorance this is our wrong conception because they don't believe in God does The Path of Knowledge the Guyana yogis [Music] or data that they say no dweta no Duality when they give the talker advices and discuss they talk like this that is also correct but when we are talking keeping the god in between we are the duating the dwellest God is there he is the all-powerful then we see the power of God has made this why it is his Divine Play it is this Divine Play who has created this universe God out of what out of God's will so now who will go and ask God hey why you have thought like that so the Swami Vivekananda when this question was asked to him he said Hindus are bold enough to say we do not know who will go and ask God why you have created Maya and this universe we are suffering in reality we are also the same God is the God's play thank you Adit is asking it seems ego is unsuperable then what to do with it just now as bhagavan sidama Krishna is advising the when we are feeling that we cannot live not feeling that is the truth without ego then turn it as a servant of God I as a servant of God doing that is called Pak army ripe ego there is no harm in that and if you practice in that way no hypocrisy you are just saying that I am the servant of God but at the same time you are enjoying when you are successful and suffering when your failure that means that is wrong but if you truly try then that will take you to the ultimate goal thank you devashish is asking is human emotions also Maya of course when there is nothing I am imagining that this is my son my daughter my grandson my granddaughter where from they came this is also the imagination this is also the Maya but that is so uniquely presented to us we do not believe to we do not we are not ready to accept that this is Maya we like it so much that's why we are bound they're similarly in in the dream when you see that we I am a king I am ruling a country people are coming and they are receiving my grace and all that suddenly somebody comes and pushed me hey why we're lying down over here you have to go and wash the dishes get up then what will happen oh my God why this man has broken my dream it is just like that we are dreaming wonderfully this world are full of my relatives My Relations but in truth real truth these are all our imaginations hmm gaurav is asking can you please explain the meaning of this quotation from Swami Vivekananda quote we are what our thoughts have made us so please take care about what we think oh wonderful so gaurav this is we are what our thought so if we think that I am going to be this you can become because the tremendous power is there in the thought in the and at the same time not only thought I am lying down and thinking that I am going to be the president of America can I become that at the same time you have to work we are what our thoughts then when I am thinking I am going to be liberated from this bondage but you have to work you have to practice meditation you have to withdraw the senses you have to practice austerity then only so thinking is the first step as the vedanta say the good wish then I have to work hard and when you are trying then the context will come sources will come and when you are utilizing those one day you will reach to the ultimate goal so whatever we think we become that is why neighbor think that I won't be able to do never think that I am nothing the negative thought will weaken us and will take nowhere so think positively try positively and give it and at the leave it at the hands of God thank you Sonu is it is more of a comment every time I listen to you I feel to be in the protection of Divine mother as if
