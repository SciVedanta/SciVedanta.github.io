[315. Panchama Veda 315 : Monastics and Householders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC7VbutCVtA)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this evening when wednesday evening we'll be reading from the gospel of bhagavatam krishna and we'll discuss on that this panchama veda the gospel of sirama krishna is full of wonderful knowledge and today we will have a discussion about the comparison between the householder and the sannyasians the monastics and the householders so let us begin kobe re-return now friends that the last time when you were reading we were reading from the page 756 in the english and we found the surama krishna as talking with the devotees whereas the our girish chandra ghosh he was reading a book written by tray lucky lucky channel he was a senior member of the brahma samaj and he wrote a book on the kashab chandrashin and there he the he wrote the girish to trailer you have written that after coming in contact with keshav sirama krishna changed his views about the worldly life but it is not true now girish noted that point and then he is discussing with the trailer who was a the regular visitor to bhagavan sriram krishna also now girish naturally as a friend as an acquaintance he was reading that book he was interested to know and both of them that they were there the kish of shane and sirama krishna now the trailer has written in this way the statement that sadama krishna has changed his views about the householders and girish told no it is not so it is not like that and sudama krishna overheard that conversation and he mentioned if a man enjoys the bliss of god he doesn't enjoy the world having tested divine place he finds the world insipid is tasteless insipid so what is this word and everything in the in our life what is there is only the joy what is the ultimate goal of the human life the joy and if it is so if the joy is the goal and obviously almost all people they're all trying to get that joy from different way from what from the worldly things and what are the world things all temporary so what is the joy all temporary joys the naturally they are not satisfied when we are thinking that if i become somebody in the society is a big position then i will be happy then after that after being so he said no i am not because my detentions people are competitions are also there then ultimately he says no it is not like this. so he again he thinks that he should be like this you should be like that a different type of desires weeping the person as if and making him run through all this when we are going through this experience again and again trying to hold something to get the joy the please the happiness and just like the flash of light and then it goes away that we again become blind and try to get it but ultimately we understand we will never get the true happiness from anything of this world so what is then the ultimate thing you have to renounce that when you renounce that then only you will get the bliss of god joy the moment we renounce the creation of god for god then one can really enjoy true bliss that is exactly what sadama krishna said if a man enjoys the bliss of god he doesn't enjoy the world this is the world means this jagat what is this jagat constantly changing what is samsara samak sarathiya completely again and again sarathi is passing away it's flowing away just like a flow of a river when you take a little water from a river and the next time we take the water from the same river it is not the same water in the meantime so much of water has already passed the same way in this jagat also so sirama krishna is mentioning about those who are who are worldly holders and householders the hold what the house house it's saying it means the all that is connected with that house that means the relatives the children and all those things the holders and exactly opposite position renouncers they give away they leave their heart and home these are the two complete different things the householders they are holding and they like to hold everything whatever they can lay their hand on they like to grab they like to hold they like to enjoy that and ultimately the result suffering so cannot understand this the one who can understand this then only the mind goes or see ramakrishna is mentioning that if a man enjoys the bliss of god he doesn't enjoy the world 3 look i said i refer to those who wanted to lead a worldly life i didn't mean renouncers master what are you talking about people talk about leading a religious life in the world but if they once test the bliss of god they will not enjoy anything else their attachment to worldly duties decline as their spiritual joy becomes deeper they simply cannot perform their worldly duties more and more they seek that joy can worldly pleasure and sex pleasures be compared to the bliss of god if a man wants tests the bliss he runs after it even afterwards it matters very little to him then whether the world remains or disappears that is a true words that is the truth so sometimes some people they adjust with that so that the devotee should not be hurt and all that i was today i was listening to uh hindi uh the discourse very nicely very sweetly the lady was exploding explaining and she was mentioning giving an example suppose you are going to die within 10 days and there's a two option there's a one crore rupees and there is a company of your family which one you will choose you are going to die within 10 days and the option has been given to you do you want one crore of rupees or the company of the family then after some time she herself gave the reply of course the company of your family so this is the way the householders they always understand and explain so they do not understand neighbor can think that beyond that there is something else what is that what that is called the renouncer's life beyond that householder's life the family the company of the wife husband children relatives that is their world they think that we will get the joy from that and most of the time they don't get that but still they go on thinking we are going to get the joy i didn't get the joy from my children well the grandchildren will give me the joy so this goes on in that way so that is the thing that we have to understand here it says then one of the scripture is mentioning as long as everything has been renounced everything so long you cannot realize the atman ticket everything including your ego including your ego the i sense that is exactly what the bhagavan srirama krishna pinpointed when you think of dhaga when you think of renouncing what we are renouncing there's some of the house some money some property some the jewelries there's nothing the main thing that one should give away is the ego the sarvabastupari the sarvabhastu depends on the ego when i am sitting in a cave of himalaya all alone but constantly thinking about all the associations that i was having oh i was the big boss ceo in a company then i had a driver i had a shakkar and i had these i had that then it is not purity you have not renounced you are thinking about that and enjoying the company in that way not physically but mentally we have to understand this this is very subtle so how we can give up when we know that there is something greater than that and that is god the existence of the atman yesterday it is my own self which is completely free from all bondages when you understand that shisha atmetica tati ultimately it is that atman they go on analyzing this the path of knowledge the goals on analyzing am i the body am i the mind then ultimately it goes and to reach over there no i am the consciousness so when they go and reach that consciousness then only that great joy comes and another what you are talking about the enjoyment of the self when you cannot renounce even the small thing so sometimes you know the people they leave the heart and home they become sannyasi they take up the garb of a sannyasi they live in the monastery but they cannot give up the ego the ego goes on increasing with so many things because they are maybe they are great meditators they can meditate for a long time then people will be coming to them appreciating them they'll be asking their blessings and slowly slowly he will start thinking or she will start thinking i am a great soul i can bless people or maybe he's a great speaker maybe he's a great writer maybe he's a great organizer maybe he's a great influencer the people are attracted all these things are bondages so one must be very very very because sometimes our senior swamijis used to say those swamis who were very good singers so they used to say be careful when you are singing sing only before god and if you are singing for the appreciation of the people then your main goal will be completely lost you cannot reach over there so they're very subtle and very thin balance over there you have to be very careful when we are doing something we are doing for the service of god then it is no problem whether people appreciate or not whether we are understanding this appreciation or criticism we are not accepting anything like this so this is the way we have to constantly go on thinking otherwise it is very very difficult in the manu and that our lawmaker he is also mentioning the same way it mentioned the one who is having the the desire for the worldly things he can give up then one who cannot give up the desire one who can give up the desire between these two the one who can give up the desire is a great person he will be successful to get the joy the sudama krishna in his word he is telling what you are talking about people talk about leading a religious life in the world but if they once test the bliss of god they will not enjoy anything all the responsibilities will go away and he is mentioning more and more through the and then he is giving an example though the chataka bird is about to die of a part's throat and around it there are seven oceans rivers lakes overflowing with water still it will not drink that water it looks up mouth again for the rain to fall when the star swati is in the ascendant to the chatago bird all waters are mere dryness beside swati water and there is a the conception that one the one type of bird chataka these chataka birds they will never drink anything but the raindrops and that to a particular time so obviously it that that gives the example that one should always all the time with all difficulty or concentrate to get the bleach of joy all other things all around should be have to be given up it's so difficult because the world is full of attraction and sometimes even the sannyasins even though they are living a recluse life even then they cannot understand this why the desires are so subtle who has made these desires the god himself it's called maya the vedanta badin they said is the maya the maya that is creating that desire and we go to that so sudama krishna giving the example of a chataka one should not try to get that and yoga bashishta also goes on telling you you cannot get it sorry about thiaga you have to give up everything and one who has already given everything including the associations that means even the association of the friends then sometimes we enjoy the talking about the worldly thing worldly thing of life and all that even that association also you have to give up so think about it completely withdrawal from the world we sometimes think about the games think about talk talk about the music talk about something some writings of the others but we think it is all pure thing we are not doing anything the bad but that is also attachment because when you are talking about that that means you have a liking so the dryness completely withdrawing and completely disassociated from that so this is the only way to realize god when one can truly do that we drawing the mind completely from the world disassociating the whole world maybe it is so much of attractions are there grandeurs are there appreciations are there but still i am not going to take anything of it so that is the way in the beginning one should practice with drawing everything otherwise it's very very difficult when swami vivekananda came over here in chicago and in america and he started giving the talk and he started becoming so popular but before that he already had the nirvikalpa samadhi two three times he was the master of his mind through nothing of this world there's some clappings of the people appreciation of the people nothing could touch his mind but he utilized that for the resurrections of india india was under the subjugations for a long long period of times we can say from the 11th century to 18th century a 19th century beginning it was under the subjugate such a long period of time and when the people are working under the operations they're not their own people so obviously they lose all their originalities and the very dangerous thing losing the self-confidence one after another generations after generations grandfather great-grandfather father each and every one going and all the time bowing down before the rulers so naturally it goes into the blood that oh we have to behave like that we are only the slaves we don't have anything to do except accepting the commands of the masters so naturally they lose all their but the india is the country where all the great thoughts generated so it is god that brought swami vivekananda and then he developed that spiritual capacity and he shook the world with the great idea and that give the self-confidence back to india what is the contribution of swami vivekananda he didn't do anything he was not a political leader he never took any uh to have any social thing nothing only services then how come the india can never forget the contribution of vivekananda because of his spiritual power that rose the confidence of the whole 3 300 million people a huge number of people only one person he inspired them to come up that so that is the contribution of vivekanda how could he do that spiritual power and after that he was completely disassociated so that is the monastic life it doesn't mean that i should not look at these people i should not touch that thing i should not go over there i should not talk on it just isolate it some people that do but they're very less powerful but when they are thinking no i should have to do that then they are completely disassociated with the worldly things with drawing that is the power with that power they are making the success that is monastic life the monastic life doesn't mean that it is completely the isolated no it is not like that the monastic life means you have to have the self-confidence that it is possible for me to do and it says in and he is telling people say they will hold to both god and the world after drinking an ounce of wine a man may be pleasantly intoxicated and also conscious of the world but can he be both when he has drunk a great deal more is giving the example of the drunkard people so when some the people they have drunk a little so they are still conscious they are talking with people and they can give the judgment everything is almost normal so like that those who are trying to realize god at the same time living in the world talking with the worldly people and attending their own businesses that is okay but suppose they're completely merged with the god intoxication they cannot do anything they're completely disassociated so for them it is impossible to do anything living in the worldly life maintaining the family having all the association attachment with all the relatives and the wealth and the property and the uh the what's called the ego everything and at the same time you are thinking that he will realize the atman no some the worldly people should not try to realize this atman that path of knowledge is not for them that is what bhagavan sinama krishna said again and again because in the path of realization path of knowledge is completely different one has to burn everything is not going back again not turning so that say burn the boat at your back and come with me march with me you have to burn the boat at your back no association at all and when they go on constantly thinking about oh i am associated with so and so and feel proud of it that means something wrong they cannot practice this so this is it's not denouncing the householder's life sirama krishna is explaining the position so you have to then pray to god so duality non-duality householder's life monastic life the one is holding the world as true living in the world as true and at the same time developing moral values that is mean slowly they are reaching to the goal a time will come because the hindus they believe in different birth so obviously in the next birth they may be in a situation from where they can start leaving as a monastic as a sannyasi as a renouncer as a recluse and obviously their life will be completely different but as long as they are in the householder's life and if they say that i am the atman i am searching my atman and that will be hypocrisy you cannot do that so when you are searching for that you have to renounce everything are you ready with that the tsunami question is very clear the sannyasis those who have already given up everything only those not only just gerua clad people are so called sannyasins and having some beard and then living in a astra but at the same time having all association surviving only because of that thing uh no that they cannot also do so friends this is very clear very clear cut conception that if you have any desire for the world nothing wrong enjoy that but forget about enjoying the true please of god realization and when you think about true beliefs of god realization you have to give up everything there's a beautiful hearing it says that if you are acquiring knowledge if you are practicing austerity if you are controlling your senses but unless and until you give up everything that vyasa he's teaching his son sukadeva vyasadeva the compiler of the all the vedas and he is teaching his son shukhadeva you may learn and you can become a scholar or you can practice austerity you can control your senses but unless and until you have given up everything what does it mean again bhagavan sinama krishna ami mole gucci be janja in bengal he said when you can abolish the i because that i associated with this body and mind and naturally if the life whatever is coming i am associated with that unless and until that eye goes away you can never even understand that success in realizing the true atmagyana the self knowledge it is not possible in mahabharata it says the vaasha was teaching his son so these are the words only those who are trying to sincerely practicing religion may understand or otherwise you know that sometimes some people they have understood something and they think that is the only correct path for them of course and they can sincerely practice that is no problem but to do sees the truth and truth may not be so palatable all the time whether you like it or not then if all people give away the world then what will happen to the world sometimes some people are good like that that is not your problem not all people can give away the world they cannot think of it these three qualities according to the shankaracharya it comes because of the the blessings of god and the great good work in the past life otherwise it is impossible the taking the as a human birth that is the great thing then the desire to get liberation from the bondage because most people they don't understand that they are abound they like to enjoy this worldly life and they are so happy if they get some success that i have seen the swamis and they are keeping the badge and they have been honored by the society they are holding that badge on the geria cloth and showing it proudly see i have got this from so and so the in the in a country or a society they have given me that means he wants the appreciation and at the same time he shows that he has he's a renouncer no i don't i don't can't understand that if you are really enjoying the appreciation of the society and going to get that and receiving a certificate from someone bowing down obviously conception should be clear except god i don't want anything not the highest and the honor of the country no i don't want that that is called sannyasi whether people blame me or criticize me or praise me or follow me it doesn't mean anything to me because i don't have any connection with this world this is really really very difficult for majority of the people to understand because they think this is we do so many things we will do also religion it's a sort of a protection from the divine so we are also giving the taxes to the government government is protecting me and i am also offering some flour and fruits to god god will protect me so this is the way always we think no it is not like that so we have to understand the one person there was a great the lady saint the one person asked her mother how could you reach to that height of spirituality then our answer was very simple because i gave up everything in hindi they say the indian language sub chori sub paway if you give up everything you get everything i give up everything so i got this so the again and again everywhere we find this in the bhagavad-gita when the arjuna was asking lord krishna how i will understand a person who has realized the atman how i will understand a person truly holy person how he will understand a person who has realized god and in the second chapter 56 verse or so this 55 56 the lord krishna is mentioning prakrishta rupi giving up perfectly renouncing what is the renouncing is sufficient why perfectly because renouncing i have left my heart and home but still i go on boasting i was the student of so-and-so university my father was a great person in that he was a great officer or a rich man or a businessman or a known person i boast on that too but i have renounced the house and i have become a monk no that is not true renouncing because you love that and when you say that when you try to prove to the people i am from so and so far that such and such family that means you feel proud of it that a decision is still there no it is not so praha prakrishta rupee natha perfectly and how it is possible against rama krishna ami mole gucci beijing very simple bengali he said as long as your eye is there no you are not a true sannyasi and when that will turn to dao yeah god then only it is okay the moment you say i me mine that association you are not a true denouncer prajuhati yada kamaan sarban all type of desire partha then when these ramakrishna messenger nations and many of the organization nowadays the hindus and nyacins are now almost everywhere they have the organization and they are working for the society they are doing many things it was not there before swami vivekananda bhagavan sir krishna now because the new train swami vivekananda introduced when you are trying to realize god why not serve the people because who is this god and swamiji's idea was based on the upanishad and upanishad each and everything is nothing but that manifestation of the supreme consciousness you can say god so that is manifested everywhere that means all the beings that we see the illiterate the down children the poor the suffering people they're also living gods and they don't have anyone the society is not looking after them the government is not capable so the swamiji said why don't you go and serve them in a detached way and you are serving the living gods and goddesses as you are serving inside the temple with that attitude you have to serve the living gods and goddesses your gods and goddesses inside the temple they are not reacting if you are making any mistake but these gods and goddesses they will be terribly reacting if you make any mistake so as a votary as a worshiper you should be very very alert i am serving a living god who is in the form of a big illiterate a suffering person so that is the way swamiji introduced now slowly other hindu organizations are also following the same and doing something some genuinely and some per the social status some for these and that you know the karma has its own effect so people if they understand properly it's okay the bhagavatam krishna gave the example a lamp is burning you can read a holy book using that light and someone can forge them the money also using that same light light is just giving the light to everyone the lamp is giving light to everyone how you will utilize that is up to you the karma yoga gives direct purification of the mind but you have to understand how we are doing it when we constantly think that we are dealing the living gods and goddesses then your mind is purified that is why it says from your mind yet the mind means and then we always say there are four parts are there in the mind four the rooms are there mana buddhic this cheetah which is having all the impressions the storehouse from there the desire should go there should be no desire the whole store should be completely clean no desire is there except the love except unselfishness because of the love for god because of the unselfish way the thought goes close we go and do that serving there is no attachment i am serving you remember and all the time you should remember me no that is not a service so this is really really very subtle and sadama krishna very clearly he is telling the people say they will hold both god and the world no it is not possible after the bliss of god nothing else tastes good then talk about omen and gold and no it is not it's completely impossible i cannot enjoy the talk of worldly people when a man becomes mad for god he doesn't enjoy money or such things extreme way ramakrishna is mentioning and you can understand the we the ramakrishna mission monks this is our ideology but at the same time bhagavan srirama krishna because of the maharada's prayer he gave us this organization through swami vivekananda and in the organization we are naturally we are organizing in different places according to the need of the locality we are giving the service and for that we are living in the society we need money but we are not attached to that money a person how he is giving it that is also one should be careful to before taking that before accepting the money we don't take that money ramakrishna mission particularly are very very careful very very careful so that way we are serving and you can understand the difficulty of the monks who are trying to be free from the worldly attachments living in the world we are writing books we are giving talks we are meeting going to the meetings we are having everything at the same time you have to withdraw it is really really difficult once you sleep from that again you fall back and your journey begins from the zero so the that is difficulty for the tapasya the spiritual practices of the ramakrishna mission monks so we have to be very very careful we are leaving like a water drop on a leaf on the leaf the water is there but it is not at all attached with the leaf so this is the life this is the train then try look but sir if a man is to retain in the world he needs money and he must also save he has to give in charity and he was trying to say many other things this is the argument usually people they say and immediately bhagavan si ramakrishna replied what do you mean that one must first save money and then seek god and you talk about the charity and kindness a worldly man spends thousands of rupees for his daughter's marriage yet all the while his neighbors are dying of starvation and he finds his heart to give them two marshals of rice he calculates a thousand times before giving them even that much the people around him have nothing to eat but what does he care about that he says to himself what can i do let the rascals leave or die all i care about is that the members of my family should leave well and they talk about doing good to others friends if you look around you will find this type of characters all over everywhere and they claim they say that they are spiritual they will run to listen to the the talks of the swamis oh i cannot live without listening to him and they're all high the vedantic talk they will go and listen and they boast about that too i only listen to him without his talk i cannot leave but go and see their personal life so one actually deceiving oneself constantly so we have to understand and analyze our own situation where am i this is my condition my mind is bound with thousands of desires and i'm so egoistic i cannot withdraw if anyone says hey what happened to you immediately i'm angry why you are asking like that friends this spiritual life means very simple but at the same time very difficult why because it is so simple we do not understand it we always think in a different way it's a very simple because the understanding should be very clear the god and his creation and if i any way go for its creation that means the name fame wealth and all these worldly five different ways to enjoy the world then i am far away from god but if i truly understand that god is the main source and if i go to god i get everything what i need joy happiness please thousands and thousands time more if i can truly go to god and out i can go to god what is the process to go back to god not that i have to give up but i have to disassociate with it this association with the world things how it is possible to disassociate because i am there i am doing bhagavan sinam krishna said turn it towards god how i am the servant of god so i am doing it the god has given me the opportunity to serve whatever my capacity i am trying to serve in this way and i am so happy i don't want anything from this world rather whatever i have earned i'll spend it for the benefit of the other people why only whatever the money millions of dollars millions of millions is there they're millionaires but they always think suppose we die that should go into the hands of my children and they will become multi-millionaires they cannot think of the people who are not having anything oh that is that's bhagavan sinah krishna is the word let the rascal die and they think they will get the blessings of god they think they will go and listen to the talks of the swamis and they think they will memorize the bhagavad-gita they think they have a group and all the time talking about god but the basic thing because we have to untie the bondage then only our boat can really go otherwise move other is not that as long as we are anchored with the ego so long rowing the boat is futile you don't go anywhere so this is clear understanding should be there i have helped my family and now i understood the other people all around they're also my family vasudeva kutumba come that is the the dictum that they taught us all the great rishis masala money devi said in this world everyone is your own there is no one that is not your own so think in that way how it is possible how they are owned because i am also thinking and also meditating on god trying to realize god and the same god same consciousness are also manifesting through them they're behaving different way they're having different names and forms but i know it is nothing but my god so i am dealing with them in a practical way but at the same time i don't have any hatred so i should not criticize them i should not try to belittle them to put them down no i should not do that so that is the way if we can then only the mind becomes purified otherwise it is not so triloka he was giving the argument but said there are good people in the world as well take the case of pundurika and that he is mentioning a devotee of the caitanya he lived in the world then the ramakrishna is mentioning he had drunk wine up to his neck if he had drunk a little more he couldn't have laid a worldly life they wanted to show that people who are living in the world caitanya mahaprabhu he actually blessed those people and he wanted them to live in the world so that the worldly people who are there the householders will get inspiration and bhagavan sirama krishna also kept some of his devotees so close to him they were coming to him again and again with the prayer shall we leave now like the master maharshi who recorded this and he sudama krishna said no you should be a teacher all through and try to inspire the young minds to go towards god that is your job and don't leave the world he said the same thing to girish chandra ghosh that these are the people they had so much of faith they could leave the world and they can they could live a monastic life but sudama krishna the god himself them to be there so that as an example they may be there and the worldly people they will get or the idea the inspiration confidence it is possible for me too grisham the gosh was also just like me he was a apparently an ordinary person he is doing the drama and drinking and behaving like this is so common so naturally if he could get the blessings of god and can develop the spiritual life of so much height there is an opportunity so this is the avataras they are giving them them this way the caitanya mahaprabhu also did the same so he is remained silent aim said aside to girish then what he has written is not true now the master mashay he was listening all this the girish ghosh was a was a great you know he had the capacity to talk so naturally he had the great capacity to win the tibet the master moshe enjoyed that trailer was a writer girish too so now the trailer wrote sudama krishna was influenced by keshav chandra shane and accepted that one can be in the world at the same time he can be pure realize god and the he objected in the beginning we were discussing that giri said no it is not surama krishna never did like that he was not even influenced by the kesha the opposite now the again the surama krishna entered and tsunami krishna said this he gave the example and we also find the same thing has been given in different our scriptures in the manusamita and all others yoga bashishta in the bhagavad-gita everywhere only one tune if you want to realize god the only way you have to give up everything from your mind from the storehouse of the mind not only floating the storehouse of the mind there should not be any desire sarvan partha manugatan everything should go be then only it is possible so that is the way we have to understand if i cannot no problem so i will start from there one step towards that is also a great step it's a great leap and now today i have heard bhagavan salam krishna is telling i have to give up everything to realize god so let me take one step today and slowly slowly i'm reading understanding and trying to practice and i need to learn to give up everything and go away suddenly no that is the wrong step what's ramakrishna is mentioning detest yourself how i can detest say thinking that it is the duty of the god i am performing i am his son i am his devotee i am a servant and whatever the responsibility god has given to me i am performing that and now god has asked hey look at that lady as your wife or that is your husband this is your children this your parents this is your family okay no problem by that way i am there at the same time when i am alone i am praying to god oh god please never ever make me completely forgetful about you and you should not cover my mind with your maya with your power because i am your child and that prayer that surrender to god will obviously remove all the bondages he is the master so obviously he can remove the and that is the way turning all our desires my anger should be turned towards god if they could realize god why i cannot god you must reveal thyself unto me when my tremendous desire is there the possessiveness so i must feel oh my god they are all holding those god i want you to hold you are my only possession so that is the way we when we are thinking we can completely be free from that so friends so let us now stop over here today and we will chant this mantra and complete and is there any question please can you read it out when we pray devas is asking when he pray to god for the well-being of our forefathers how it is beneficial for them even after their death who passed away more than a decade and might taken rebirth good question but the thing is it is not for them it is for us it's called sradha saddam that we are remembering them why something we have got from them had not they not be here we would not have been like this so we are not forgetting you this is called the respect that we are giving and purifying our mind it's not for them it's for our only personal mind so when whether they have passed away 10 years 20 years before it doesn't matter when we are thanking them praying for them seeking blessings from them by that way i am showing my gratefulness to them and this gratefulness is one of the pillar of human life so that is why we do thank you and radha she is asking what is a sense of life when a person is bedridden and suffering with mental agony and wanting death yes is a there's a really the question that you are asking apparently we are thinking in that way you know that that is the reason they always ask us to become spiritual try to try to develop the spirituality when you are young when we have the strength of mind and body but most of the people they make it a mistake they think that let us enjoy now and at the end of our life we will become the spiritual no that is the wrong thing but a person who is now bedridden and his mental agony is there and he is wanting death now we have to pray for that person and when you are praying for that person again we are actually benefiting ourselves because the compassion the love the concern for that person that we are showing by praying to god will have both effect the our prayer will give some solace to that suffering soul at the same time our mind will be purified because i am not praying for me i am praying for someone else of course the doctors are taking care from that on that side and how i can help by praying so rather we can if you can pray sincerely oh oh my master oh my god oh my mother that this person is suffering she was so close you are so close to me at this moment please help him or other suppose he or she is becoming all right again is good otherwise please do what is good for him or her that is the way we should pray thank you so let us now conclude niranjanam nityam anantharupam [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] namaste you
