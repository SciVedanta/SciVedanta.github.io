[273. Panchama Veda 273 : The Journey From Nishtha To Prema Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaXqi3FmXvI)

namaskar good evening dear devotees and friends today we will be discussing the panchama veda gospel of bhagavatam krishna and let us begin with this mantra as usual we do little now the last wednesday we were supposed to discuss about the journey from nishta to prema is the path of bhakti but as because that was the ram navami day so i discussed about sri ramachandra and the devotion of the maabir anumanji today let us continue that the journey from the nishta to prema bhagavan sirama krishna in the gospel of suramar krishna page 680 the chapter the star theaters ramakrishna at the star theater there he is mentioning nishta leads to bhakti bhakti when mature becomes bhabha bhabha when concentrated becomes mahabhava and the last of all is prima and here one by one step he is giving and we find that the five steps he is telling nishta then bhakti bhabha mahabhava finally prema friends we have already discussed about this bhakti a few times we have done sirama krishna many a times diapering about the bhakti the devotion and here he is giving the steps first is the nishta what is this nishta the nishta means suppose i have accepted something some philosophy some ideology and and then i'm sticking to that though i don't understand it maybe i'm not liking it in the beginning but since i have decided to do it i am doing it regularly without fail this is called nishta that sincerity and will never ever deviating from that particular routine that's why when in the bhagavad-gita see arjuna is asking to bhagavan sri krishna how it is possible to do perform then the bhagavan is telling that you have to about the control of the mind the bhagavan said and that is the only answer bhagavan sri krishna said you have to go on repeating repeating and repeating this then second line it comes if you like to control your mind if you like to and everything is control the mind again and again that i say that there is jagat there is this universe there is this world which is the creation of the lord and it is not real creation it is the imagination but when we go for that thinking that that is the real naturally we come back with the sorrow with the failure again and again again and again but that is so tempting we always forget it as the hiasins are covering the water of the pond and when we remove the ear scenes we can see that beautiful water very clean water but after some time again when you are not bathing over there again those essence comes and cover so similarly our mind is also covered with so many desires icha vasana all these words they use now one after another the desire will come and it will cover so what is the sadhana only to keep away all those desires the desire for the worldly things how we can keep away those desires creating a desire for god the mind cannot go without desire it needs the desire and instead of the desire for the world if we give the desire for the god so obviously it will go towards god it will try to find god understand god but the difficulty is in the beginning it is not that tasty as because we have not seen god we have only heard about god but we have to have the faith in the words of the great rishis our gurus and the scripture and we have to say to our mind no that's because these great souls they have said like this so obviously it is better that we we put it we should completely as because we are constantly thinking of the worldly things it is better that we say that no we are not going to go for these why because again and again we have tried to get the joy out of this and again and again we have failed this is our experience from that experience only we are applying this mind so this is called nishta the repeated try that is nista but nista the beginning even that f4 don't come if we don't have faith the fast is the faith that's why shraddha swami vivekananda again and again he said becomes and he gives the example of the nachiketa the sridhavan means the example is the nachiketa he had the great faith on himself and also faith on the words of the scripture the guru so himself faith means faith on himself means that i can do it i can achieve it it is possible for me unless that basic thing is there we won't be able to try again even so we have to start with the faith and then we should not give up the reason also when we are giving up the reason then that faith takes us to a very narrow dark lane where instead of becoming a spiritual person we become debuts so that is the reason we have to be very very careful sometimes some people will come and they will according to their own the way they will explain the scripture and in the name of god in the name of religion they will ask you to do some work which cannot be religious work so that intelligence should be there and well you are asking me to go and harm those people in the name of religion but who is god god is full of love who has created this universe god has only created then as he has created me has created that person also so why should i go and harm that is the basic question the first question so bachara always the discrimination is necessary in the name of religion no i cannot do that that's the first thing whoever says even it says that suppose the vedas say that the milk is black is it because the veda says shall we accept it no we have to go and analyze no it is not possible then the swa dharma is there in my sadharma as because i am a shatria and a soldier i am supposed to protect the country and the people then i have been asked to do this go and fight i will do that for that i am not thinking oh i am going to fight maybe that i will kill people maybe the scene will come no i am observing doing performing swadharma it's a very subtle thing we have to understand this so the bichara the very sharp bachara is necessary and that is why again and again we have to go to the holy company holy company can only help us to do this the first thing is this first is i must go to a holy company hear about god listen about god try to understand about god and if i have the luck then i will be guided by a real good person about god as a shankara says the guru the guide spiritual guide is because of the lord's grace god's grace you get this we begin then the guru says in the morning and evening you should take the name of god then you should read the books like this then you should try to meditate try to help others all these processes here begins the nishtaa the surama krishna is telling about the but in other places he said when someone was asking said is it possible for us the householders to realize god why not how it is possible sadhu sangha go to a holy person and listen from him then he said nirjanabash you have to leave in a secluded place to analyze that word is it possible for me am i progressing like that and then bichara the suppose i go for these what i am going to get what are the things that going to happen that sometimes some people come for religion only just because of the miracles they think if i go and meditate if i learn this if i learn that then the miraculous power will come i will become like this i will become like that nothing to do like in the in the spiritual life the true spiritual life means love for god so suramar krishna is guiding us and then he says nishta frost and we heard from the guru heard from the scripture and then we have got the instructions that to develop the spiritual life to go to god you have to practice like this we from here nista and state firstly we are going on repeating that the when the nisthas ramakrishna's world leads to bhakti now comes the bhakti and about the bhakti previously we have read many of the great uh the devotees the scholars the chandelier narada they have given the definitions bhagavan sirama that means that to that god and here the whether the god is a mother or a male no it is that which is consciousness but you can imagine the god as your mother as your father there is no problem but you have to have the faith that is god is there then you are practicing and repeated practice will make your mind pure and what are the practices we are doing regularly taking the name of god bhagavan sirama krishna he has already mentioned about here kai monobakya and he explained even what is the kaya physically the with the hands i am serving the god whatever the good work i am doing any work that i am doing doing for the good of the humanity as because i have the lake i am going to the holy places visiting the temples visiting the holy people visiting those places where the good work is going on positive thoughts they are discussing we go and listen so kai mana bakkya and in the mind what we do constantly going on repeating the name of god and the bakya singing the name of god so these are the first he said we have already read and discussed about that so karma means three physical then mental psychological and through words that is very important so after that we are going on practicing from the patrice nishta comes the bhakti bhakti means a faith has come that is the beginning of the bhakti complete faith has come and in that faith because of the different experiences and we can now analyze i was just thinking that i should do like that and then somehow things started going on in favor of me then i could do it just few days before it was not possible now it is so the devotion is growing now god must be there he is helping me otherwise how these people are coming and helping me otherwise how these people are so kind to me and all those things that is happening all around me how it is possible faith is coming and on that bhakti as bhagavan suramar krishna is telling and according to the narada whatever i perform i give it to god because god is there first i offer him then only i take the food i am going out for some work i am first praying to god then stepping out of the door like this all the time feeling the presence of god with me akilah achara this is the way the someone is practicing not that constantly he can see the gods standing before him or her no but he's feeling that god as because he's all pervading and so many days so many years and so many difficult situations i simply could come up and then moving that means something is there which is helping me i should continue then bhakti the devotion is coming faith is coming love is coming and whatever i am doing i am offering to that god and when i am offering to the god can i claim that that is mine no i have written a beautiful article and i offered to god people are praising about the article not the book but i am not taking that credit because god gave me that idea i just could express it that's all and god was holding my pain i could write it that humbleness is coming it is said that when the lord krishna left arjuna the great hero was so proud about his bow could not lift it when the aveera a group of people they were attacking the ladies of the yadava clan the arjuna was supposed to protect them but arjuna could not do it he could not lift his weapon why because the god was not there if the god is not with us it is impossible so that is the reason one must be humble so what is making the narada he said i am offering everything whatever i do how i do physically mentally and through my words these are the three ways i am serving all the time these three all three i am offering to god what is it then after that what happens i become humble i become humble i said that is the main thing in the devotion that ego is going away and in exchange what i am gaining what are the positive things i am giving away then the positive what i am gaining thought that god when i forgave that god even for a second i feel bangs within my heart oh why i couldn't remember it why it is possible so that is the way we should have to feel so that says the bhakti and when bhakti mature it becomes bhabha now we can understand if the bhakti the with the sincere love and the faith and the feeling that god is always with me and the feeling that whatever i am doing everything because of the god all the success that i am having because of the god and my ego is going out me and lowering lowering and lowering so i am my mind is becoming pure the moment the ego is gone what happens revelation of the divinity within my heart that's all so that becomes bhabha when the bhabha comes then i see god everywhere without god i cannot think of each and everything is god now friends those who have read the biography of bhagavan si ramakrishna you know he went to zoo garden and he saw that lion over there the moment all people are looking at the lions the big big cages and their lions are there it did as a that is the how the the it is for the teaching it is about the knowledge of the people so what is lying how they leave etc we all go see that beast that much but what bhagavan suramar krishna saw he saw mada durga because the lion is the carrier of goddess durga the seeing that beast seeing that animal seeing the lion immediately the mind is going to goddess durga this is because of the bharabha completely everywhere one european boy he was standing leaning against the tree and he was putting the leg in the the such a way as we always see the image of the lord krishna playing the flute and standing in that way and three different parts of the body is bending so it says in sanskrit three bhanga muradi muradi means the krishna three bhanga in three different places why because he has become so soft why so soft because devotion so that is the symbol of devotion one european boy he was playing over there in calcutta park and suddenly sudama krishna noticed that boy he is leaning against the tree and standing in the way that the krsna's image are immediately he didn't see that european boy again he saw krishna over there this is the bhabha and he could see that true person sometimes some people used to curve externally they are so religious time but sudama krishna couldn't even touch them or accept anything touched by them why hypocrisy they are not thinking of god they are very egoistic only they're demonstrating in such a way having the marks and the putting the cover and all that as if to demonstrate that i'm a holy person people will respect them but sirama krishna's eyes that immediately could extract that and feel they will never so that is called bhabha bhabha gives us that so first is nista nishta to bhakti bhakti to bhabha bhabha when concentrated becomes mahabhaba and in this mahabharata we can imagine the bhabha and muhammad when the word maha the supreme has been added with this word bhabha that means every moment of his life he sees only god and nothing else then come prima prema is the ultimate now we read from the gospel the in the words of bhagavan krishna the last of all is brima prema is like a god by prema god is bound to the devotee he can no longer run away now he says an ordinary person can at best achieve bhabha nan but the ishwara ishwara koti attains mahabhaba and prema chaitanadev attained them the mahabhava and prema what is the prema when he or she the devotee forgets the body consciousness they always think about that i am that god it is like if you as because they are we are discussing on the path of bhakti the if the path of gyana they'll say ahamra mahashmi aham brahmasmi is the prema or mahabhaba condition of the devotion so as the path of knowledge takes us to that height where we can say that i am that supreme brahman all but with pervading consciousness and he cannot think of anything else but that the mahabharata that great devotion also takes us to that and cannot think of anything else bhagavan sirama krishna is talking about caitanya mahaprabhu who was almost like 500 600 years before bhagavan sirama krishna and what happened to him mahabharata he could not differentiate the ocean and the krishna and even the ocean was nothing but the krishna for him he used to go to jagannath temple in puri and there when he is to look at that mahaprabhu jagannath prabhu that image is there hundreds of people are looking at that image but the caitanya prabhu saw that he and the god are one that's why he never went close to that the one day he entered into the temple and marched into that he passed away so that is mahabhava how ordinary person can have that we are going on cleaning our mind we are removing all our past karmas and we are trying to think about god constantly all the process making our mind pure and purity means giving away the world accepting the god that's all so when we are going on practicing that ultimately we can reach up to or a great soul can reach up to the bhabha so when he sees the god everywhere he feels god presents everywhere up to that but the mahabhava and prema it is impossible when that that's why i for the prema they always talk about the radha some people they say the researchers they say that radha was not there in the there was no mention about the radha only one in one place it is there so it says the rather conception of radha it is the introduction by the godia vaisnap sampradaya why because of the prema the conception of the prema which manifested in the personality of caitanya mahaprabhu so they depicted that a lady as if the so much of love for krishna she is forgetting everything even the society even her personal life even a personal body she's forgetting and constantly seeing that god everywhere and then they gave the story in the beginning she was trying to remember trying to pray to god sometimes she was having her own ego that the god is not looking at me talking with me i will also not talk to him all those things were going on and then slowly slowly developed up to mahabharata and prema and she completely converted into the krishna so that these all the examples they wanted to present before us and as because it is the love so as a lady but sometimes the conjugal love they they are applying like that it's not like it's the pure devotion for the consciousness and when you feel that consciousness everywhere and you are making a personified thing so krishna that is the consciousness who is everywhere if you are reading the bhagavata and other places the sri krishna is having the company of thousands of the gopinis the gopa and gopinis the all the residents of that blessed brindavan the krishna is with each and everyone who ever went to krishna krishna is with them so they are thinking the krishna is with me each an individual like and when you are meditating suppose hundred of us are meditating in one place each and every one suppose at the same time feeling that god is present in my heart no harm because god is all-pervading it is not one god god can be in millions of hearts at a time and if you think that god is with me only god cannot go to you oh that is a very very narrow way and he has no idea about god and sometimes some people not understanding this conception of god who is all pervading who is present in everywhere they try to get the keep the god as their own personal thing that my god a god cannot be shared with others and no one can take that god from me no god cannot live with them and that is that that really happened in if you read the biography of krishna there was a person who is to serve suramar krishna and then slowly he developed the ego that i am serving sirama krishna and so many people are coming and worshiping him because i am taking care of him so he also wanted the same type of attentions from the other devotees and he grew up that ego then ultimately he was removed from there and the sudama krishna wished to depend on him because of his service people thought if he is going away from here what will happen to sudama krishna nothing some other people came and he they started helping and serving that person he was so close to sudama krishna these are the teachings he used to come at the gate of the dakshinesha but was not permitted to enter into the campus of the dakshinisha and he used to send words with a prayer to suramar krishna can you please come out i just like to have darshan sudama krishna went talked with him and said this is important he was there 24 hours with him now he went saw and said i am busy today come some other day exactly that happens if you like to grab the god it is only our god and we are not going to allow anybody to enter into his temple do you think that god will be happy exactly oppose it he will never get the blessings of god whoever is coming he may be his devotee maybe not maybe of your the same religion maybe not it doesn't matter at all god is residing in every heart that is the teaching one when they reach into that that is the idea that comes baba everywhere ultimately the finally the radha the she felt the god is everywhere and all the jealousies that all gone only the love flowed and she was also feeling that i am also with god in different forms the god is with him god is with heart god is with these god is it that i am that all the form that is playing with the god i am that that is called me stage when those people they reach over there they feel like that so nirvikalpa samadhi yogi will say this is the nirvikalpa samadhi one with god and the gyani will say this is the brahma-gyana bhakta will say this is the prema what is prema mahabhaba this is the prema this is the mahabhava how it is possible you have to be swattvaguni fast and what is the sattva guni the swattva is the best quality the love and unselfishness we can explain the sattoi these two words two qualities this one is love another is unselfishness that's why swami vivekananda and i quote again and again unselfishness is god those who are discussing about the religion trying to practice about the religion these are the things we must understand these two qualities we must have to have love for each and every one without any reservation and at the same time unselfishness time will come we are now slowly practicing and time will come that we can embrace each and every one and that is called sattva guna the color of the sattva government guna is white that's why the very fair complex what is rather very fair complex and what is krishna the dark complexion what is the krishna is dark complexion is he not having the sattva quality no of course he is there sattva is there he is beyond satya rajyathama and he is unknown the people cannot know him that's why that so these are all symbolic way the hindus are trying to give the profound philosophy the bhagavatama krishna said one can go up to that and he mentioned caitanya deva attained them mahabhaba and prema so friends we are now a journey that we are in the form of this star let us begin with nishta and our goal is to reach to that bhabha then maybe if we are blessed by that god someday mahabharata and praying will also come so nishta bhakti bhabha mahabhava and the prema i will conclude this particular discussion by you know that one's incident that happened when bhagavan sirama krishna asked maha saradamani devi you should not give the my foot play to anyone because different people with the different mentality they are coming that touch thing i cannot accept you know that the that incident and the the lady who wanted to ma mother sarudamani devi she was bringing that plate and suddenly that lady came almost snatched from the from mother's hand and brought that plate and placed before suramar krishna and for his lunch suramar krishna sat over there couldn't eat and the mother came as sardamani devi as because the warm place she was fanning a little so that the person who is eating can feel little comfortable and mother was doing that suramar krishna told you know that lady and why you have given the food to her mother told two sentences this is important if anybody call me as mother i cannot say no to him or her just call me as mother the mother's day is a coming so this is the word masala mani devi said and what is this mother compassion what is this mother all all covering compassion love so that is mother mother's heart only my children should survive martial children should eat and nobody is not that is not the mother's heart so this is the mother don't she said i'm i cannot say no to them who will call me as mother so that lady came and wanted the plate to carry for you she called me mother so i gave next day even again if she's coming and doing the same thing i will again give it to you get to heart to bring it to you then she said you have to eat it why this is the great word she said any wife would be very happy if the husband is telling you should only bring the food no other one should bring and you should take care of me i'm not going to take the help of anyone all the wives will be very happy if they can do like that with the husbands but the mother said you are not an ordinary person sir though you are my husband well i have the opportunity and the right to serve you but you are god and as because you are the god you are all pervading you have to accept each and every one and whoever comes before you with a great love and devotion and faith with an intention to serve you obviously i will also accept that that is called prema the prema there is no difference so friends this is a great discussion a journey from nishta to prema and in between to reach from nishta to prema we are covering bhakti bhabha mahabhaba then we are going to prema let us pray that someday we will develop that prema bhakti for the god now suramar krishna is telling what is the meaning of gyana yoga so this is the notice this is hinduism the fast the the uniqueness of krishna he's guiding through all the four paths sometimes some most of the teachers most of them holy masters what they did only one path they showed then devotion only devotion gayana only gyana but here bhagavan sirama krishna he is accepting all the four paths so he is the god of samanya samannaya devata the unification of all different paths all different ideas but taking to the one goal only that is god who is all pervading consciousness he is telling like this what is the meaning of gyana yoga bhakti yoga he was discussing yoga means union union with god union with the atman union with the consciousness brahman so here he says what is gyana yoga is the path by which a man can realize the true nature of his own self yet the is is capital if the self means the paramatma now through the prema where we reached to god and who is this god is he separate than me no i don't feel that because everything including me i see that is god and what the ghani will gany means those who are following the path of knowledge what is their experience self what is this self the paramatma that is the consciousness that is residing within me as the jivatma as an individual self and that is also the supreme self paramatma it is the path by which a man can realize the true nature of his own self it is the awareness that brahman alone is his true nature then he says pralhada sometimes was aware of his identity with brahman prahlada was a great devotee it's a character that you find in the bhagavata the pralhada though his father was a was not at all accepting the god but his son the man who never accepted god rather denounced the existence of god his son got that devotion he became the prahlada a great devotee he many a times used to feel that he is brahman why bhagavan sram krishna is certainly mentioning this because we should not think that there are two different paths and still now we are fighting among the hindus no no they are all ghana yogis we don't visit them so we are only bhakti our devotion will be and if we are going and mixing with them and listening to them and so sometimes i have a heart those who are following the path of devotion they ask their disciples their students not to listen to the talk of the jana yogis why your bhakti will be harmed with the wrong conception through this path you will reach to god and where you will see you and god are same through that path they will go to the ultimate and they will find not god but the self is the same only terminology changes but the thing is the same here bhagavan sirama krishna again the eunuch friends you know many of you those who are knowing me i have a great dream and i am constantly praying to the divine lord bhagavan si ramakrishna and the shakti the power mah sharadamani devi that let these come up successfully that is home of harmony it's the home the people should know swami vivekananda came here in chicago standing over here he gave the call of unity and not destroying the diversity unity doesn't mean that it should be mixed together and make it no not like that it is only each and every individual will be separate and their ideologies their philosophies their paths all will be different and let them enjoy that but the ultimately when they go to that summit there they will find the same thing some people are eating bread some people are eating rice some people are eating only vegetables but the goal is to satisfy their hunger taste may be different cooking may be different the people who are serving may be different the places where they are sitting and eating that may be different but what is the ultimate goal satisfaction of my hunger if by eating rice i am still hungry that means that is not the proper food for me something wrong so that is the ultimately we are coming to that and what is that god again and again we have to remember l o b e is god whatever the religion paths that we are following it is a high time now in these modern societies when we are debating on so many things and we know so many things we have to understand and we have to unders not only understand we have to teach our next generations that it is love that is god you may call the god as jehovah or buddha or whatever name you like but it is only love and that love that reaches everywhere embraces each and every one so bhagavan srirama krishna he was talking about the bhakti just next para he is talking about the gyana and he is taking us to that ultimate goal of the gyana he says it is brahman pralhada a devotee sometimes were aware of his identity with brahman and sometimes he would see that god was one and he another so this is the devotion and the gyana coming together and it is possible for one person also to understand and realize and enjoy the two different things at such time he would remain in the mood of bhakti hanumana said to rama sometimes i find that you are the whole and i am part sometimes that you are the master and i am your servant but o rama when i have the knowledge of reality i see that you and i you are i and i am you that this is a great sloka that had said and this is true hinduism there is no difference so friends i have a dream that in that home of harmony we will invite the different groups of the hindus and will ask how you think how you look at god sit by side by side please tell what is god you think what are the practices you are doing performing so that you can reach to that ultimate goal if we sit together and say our goal and the practices i am sure we will understand actually we are going to the same goal somebody is going by train somebody by a car somebody by some other vehicle but we are going over there to the same goal and then this the in the name of religion bloodshed will be lessened i cannot say completely stop will listen because this is the teaching of bhagavan si rama krishna unification the more the people will read the biography of bhagavan si ramakrishna will read and try to understand his teaching through the panchama veda gospel of srama krishna the more it is better for the human society and it says that girish he was listening he claimed ah he was satisfied listening to this the master is telling why shouldn't a man be able to realize god in the world why he is asking surama krishna is asking why shouldn't a man be able to realize god in the world but he must have discrimination and dispassion he must have bichara is not only giving up the world but at the same time you have to accept the god and why should i do that when i am debating within myself and that is called discrimination i i'm judging i'm debating i'm trying to analyze i'm trying to understand why should i not go and grab that power that money the name the fame why not that is called discrimination the suppose i gave that for how long where is that great napoleon in the page of the history that's all and for that should i give my life so many times i was born so many times i will born again if i am not realizing this one truth and so many times so many different forms i will take and so many times i will suffer so that is we have to understand again and again why shouldn't a man be able to realize god in the world but he must have discrimination and dispassion he must have the unsick shakeable awareness that god alone is real and all else is unreal and has body two days existence it will not do to float on the surface you must dive deep you must dive deep thank you friends so today after this and then again in the summer the day in the next wednesday we'll discuss from here let us conclude by saying this prayer our pranam to bhagavan sirama krishna he asked us to dive deep so when we are listening these words reading these words pondering on his teachings and then our mind should be withdrawn for the world and go down to the god which is consciousness [Music] is [Music] [Music] namaste
