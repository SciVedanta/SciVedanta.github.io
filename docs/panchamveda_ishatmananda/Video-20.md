you let us begin tabu khatam rhythm dr. G venom kobe VI rhythm calma shop ahom shravana mangalam srimad athim who Bakunin te hui da jana august 27 that class we heard from sri Mogg is expressing his idea about agha bansi ramakrishna raghavan see ramakrishna the god in human form but the way he is telling it was unique the way he is expressing it was unique so after hearing his answer ceramic ISNA laughed he was happy and he up appreciating his analysis that shows then you rate that see ramakrishna asking three more master masha to meet him at bollaram Babu's house at band baaja calcutta sliema he said well i will come then afterwards when he was going out almost near the gate of the docks anisha he felt this person the balarama borscht is a very rich man is a landlord will you allow me to enter into his house so he came back when he came back he saw ceramic in a different mode ceramic ich nur was cutting jokes is making fun and that was a different ceramic ish nuh but this time win three more made him he was alone pacing that not mandira and immediately three more he felt on our picture the word he has used a person who is not depending on anything else he is completely in his control he knows what is it that on a picture the wonderfully he mentioned and then afterwards three more when the monster masher I see Ramakrishna asking why you have come back then he said I think it is better that I will meet you over here next time otherwise if they don't allow me to go I enter into then see Ramakrishna said the tumi amar nom curvy you just say my name utter my name pronounced my name nom even ami the name the world that is connected with the personality they're all sing nom evil nami chaitra Chaitra gum according to a gavotte Gita this is the body is the  and trigger is inside and the moment we are touching the taking the name of the Chaitra gum everything is done talkin give hora Tamaki ah marka Cheney has been someone will bring you to me he is confident now up to these we have great here is a next chapter today will read that account of three mom he noted this account in March eleventh 1882 he is giving the title of the chapter see Ramakrishna dr. shangai ceramic ISNA in the company of devotees he's mentioning about out eight o'clock in the morning see Ramakrishna went as planned to balarama Bo's house in Calcutta it was the day of dholu yatra you know previously 3mon knew the serum krishna said you were to come but here he made one little mistake after the researchers next researchers they are mentioning no it was not the dolo yatra they're mentioning that it is actually they according to the almak of the gupta priests 11th march 1882 was not the dolo yesterday it was after cement seven days of the doriath the usual in Calcutta and some other can cities in those days daljit remains it will continue for in such a long time the people will be playing the collar and all that if the fun goes on and on so obviously three mom thought that when he came there still may be that thing's was going on so he thought it is a dull job resume perhaps he mentioned like that rom mana mohan Rakhal need to go pal and other devotees were with him into Kim has bidden by the master as a ceramic ISNA asked him to come so he also came all these devotees the devotees and the master sang and danced in a state of divine power several them we're in an ecstatic mode neato gobbles chased glued with the absurd of emotion and Rakhal lay on the floor in ecstasy completely unconscious of the world the master put his hand on Raquel's chaste and say peace be quiet this was Raquel's vast experience of ecstasy again in the hood Bowden they did a research on all the small small things and particularly shantou Reuben and that you will be coming here in October fifth will address here that shantou Reuben and the G was the person who did the research on the khatam Rita and made it the whole thing as a day twice and then finding out small small loopholes corrected it giving the footnote here he has given the footnote that the it was not the fast one it was the second ecstasy that rock Alma Hodge experience because master Michelle he himself had as mentioned in September nineteen eighteen eighty four entry rahuls fast experience of ecstasy happened in 1881 and the account is eighteen 8211 March so obviously look at it it is so critically things are being judged every moment everywhere so this way we find that ceramic ish nuh is he lived with his father about the Rakhal maharaja we came afterwards the first president of the Ramakrishna martin mission he was the childhood friend up naringin are Vivekananda he also joined and afters became sannyasin very famous and yasi and he lived with his father in Calcutta now an then visited the master at dictionary about this time he had started a short while in big toe sucker schools at shampoo cool those are the places one should go all now it is congested so many people are there and Calcutta has developed so much but those are the places where alabanza Ramakrishna is to move now it is not ramachanda are the Krishna this time vagabond has come in a different form in the sri ramakrishna and he is going and meeting the devotees why to remove the ignorance ignorance about what ignorance about religion and he was pouring in them giving them the spirituality so that is exactly the whole area used to roam because that time Calcutta now the present calcutta where all the government officials are there and afterwards it is very new recent only in those days the british used to leave on that dedos area so they never allowed the Indians to go and leave this to go and do the services and come back and main Calcutta area with all educated people bengali particularly they were in the North Calcutta is called North Calcutta and the but Roger kanal is there well mother's houses there the bug budget canal it was there they said the previously the marathas used to come from nagpur kanako particularly pune those areas is to come to plunder and britta shirts they never fought with them because they were ferocious fighters so naturally the British as if they are going to fight there will be some people will die acceptor why they will take the risk late this poor people died and they are dying in the hand of the same people let them and that's why the British astable protected their own people who are living in that area and Marathas used to come crossing the Andhra Pradesh then the Bihar girisha and the part of being all and at the time of going back many of them the settle but when they came near to Calcutta Britishers found if they entered in to calculate America houses also so they dubbed a huge strange it's called murata canal and this side in the Calcutta side is to put the cannons to protect the Calcutta and murat has understood why do you have to go inside because all money is here so there's two and then leave doll so many of them didn't go back so they mixed the Bengalis and the murat ease the many many places they mixed up and that is the new generation of bengalis they are also living over there so this was the story long back at present when see Ramakrishna is coming he is coming to the Calcutta from destination crossing Ganga entering into Calcutta and roaming about in the North Calcutta because all these people were there and Rakhal Maharaja also the brahmana and the G afterwards with him as Swami he was staying with his father because his father wanted that he should receive the English education so he was studying in Calcutta when the music was over the devotee sat down for their meal bholaram stood there homley that master mache is no teaching and when he is giving the report you see how perfectly he is giving the report whenever we ask someone how was that retreat when the schwa me came I was in Calgary how was it and I asked three or four of them for different types report so one this is just a joke one person he complained to his master said you paid me so less but were paying to that man sitting over there all day and you call him manager and pay him so much I am doing so much of work all day and perspiring but you give me little money and he is giving so much of money is it good the master said ok that's true let me judge you I'll have it xane see there's a sheep has come now go and inquire about the ship he went and inquire and came back running very happy what is it Oh sheep has come from Italy is it what for that I didn't ask you have to from grad the cheapest so I only ask that okay go and ask what what they have come he went and asked but they have brought so many mark in visas they will sail over here what are the mark in pieces that I didn't end where you told the what photo like this he went ten times and then complete picture okay like sit over here now i will send the manager manager you go and see what is that ship is for manager when noted down name of the captain and the from the ship is coming what are the market indices they like to sell what are the things they like to purchase exit to Exeter all details he brought and the master sexy look at this so the observation should be very perfect when we have given the description we should not have anything added from our site no emotion no attachment no likings no dis likings exacting we have to reproduce then only it is possible must immerse a description was perfect the he is giving it when the music was over the devotees sat down for the meal bholaram though he he was the master of the house and he was the landlord stood there humbly like his servant look at it when the people are coming to my house and I am feeding them okay have you taken that that was nice and we brought it from there event no not like that very harmless standing like a servant the giver should kneel down swami vivekananda is telling the giver should kneel down so when you are feeding people are the people know that the living gods at ET de Beauvoir so I am feeling the div 0 TT is there but by God's in different forms so that we have to be very very humble aim was still a stranger to the devotees having made only neuringer addiction Asia now when the devotees coming together meeting each other and they are becoming a family that is the idea of Ramakrishna mission so that way only they all become together and become friendly bhakta johnny marr wilson the devotee has no caste and Creed and race and all that the devotee of God that's all that is the beauty of the teaching so that we have to invite whatever is has become following salam kitchen is difficult the ideology of Saddam addition is so far so broad so deep so that is the reason we have to understand that serum Krishna is going to different devotees house I'm calling different people over there he is not only going to meet only the family members of the cows know when he went to cholera Mundine and that balarama Monte ray went for more than hundred times and not only that he took rise over there you know in those days a brahmana taking arise and Balarama was borscht he was not a ramen so obviously he's taking the cooked rice over there and so much of discussion will be among the ground means in those days naturally he never cared more than hundred times you go into it there he went and took the cooked food because he is to see the heart afterwards if you just latter in visited the master reduction in sure it was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the master and he were sitting on the steps of the shiva temples looking at the temple of radha krishna across the court here the master went into an ecstatic mood let me ask you a question how many of you have visited Calcutta the cynosure oh so many good so now otherwise I would have asked you to go to now there is a program is coming in will mark the concluding function of the Swami Vivekananda's 150th birthday anniversary nearly fourteen fifteen thousand people will assemble so they are giving an option for us if you want you can say the the devotees from Chicago so of course the 31st August was the last day but I can request them to extend it so if anyone particularly any American friends they like to go it will be an experience for them it will be January 25 to 30 januari 2014 today and it's a very good time january is coal and with a very good time and they'll be taking to all these devotees to come out to cojer Ambati all the places and you can go and see so many thousands of people will be there and beautiful by the side of the Ganges is a wonderful pandal will be there salam Krishna's temple and all other temples a huge area and since that master mache there is looking at bitter so really master went into an ecstatic mode to the fall his wife is a husband but the officers is totally ransom facility whether one father is very caucuses ingenious you were stealing his daughter we are not going to stop us like this market and people to me very much talking do something he will be finally to passing by God it will poke it and stop his over here but in the shop father will go she will pursue what you wanna know more how of the mother through the step I must now the same person when he's here in office can eat all in its property like this / daughter came his simply shouting the next day she was dead and the other was deleted we mainly because we are only late you see it alone hi shishito mr16 yet till I'm 16 you are not supposed to be a vegetable so this is another year so we do it so she is he had to live because of the relation do you know same God he's dancing and killing destroying the whole universe thinking to make it totally different keep it in shape that is a different machine tax you endeavor to and for the Ganges water but the bill but these are there no no one can a crystal Sheila doctor is going home and the scenes you will be sitting quietly all people away and making fun bleeding and these are there is interest with the devotees she was different with the demos the similarly we were no God completely sasame business my father but he did back freeze to deal with yearning her he can reach me through the eye place but any more extreme if anyone is mainly you i am good knowing you how many more anyway this is the only the same detect the bottom society girl and this week we are going to the piece for me we next to survive we let progress willing to be good education to our children we need good health prediction for the younger generation economic the jobs is the one nothing why not that rich nature's to write them why they're constantly thinking about the war and fighting and this is dead didn't see anywhere everywhere these are the frosting now they are not a car that is problem happy because you as salaam business taking here in the lethal Legion with all so many division but to deal with the yearning hurt he can reach d through digress by any path mother show me sometime how the Christians pray to D in their churches the excellent prayer I want to go to the charge I want to see how they pray to thee in the name of Jesus Christ see the broadness of heart again the ceramic ISNA is telling Bart mother what will people say if I go in if I enter into the church and then will the my people the Hindus will they allow me to enter into the temple again it is better you show me from distance why is telling like this is he afraid with the society no Shami be wakened is telling truth never pay any homage to the society society has to be homeish to the truth why then see Ramakrishna's telling like this because people are not ready they have to wait they have to learn I was talking with our different frames the Hindu friends they came I told it is very good that you were constructing temple everywhere it is good that you are bringing the priests who are properly trained to do the worship but take care they should not bring along with the religion and the other knowledge of religion pooja the superstitions if they are bringing the superstitions along it theme don't bring them rather you learn and you see after the retirement what you are going to do to go over there learn the puja do puja that will be sufficient I am Telling You God will be so pleased with you in ramakrishna mission everywhere in the private centers our 10th president of the Ramakrishna order he used to inspire you should not hire any priest for thuja rather has been drive let you come in the morning and do something little puja and next another couple will come in the evening they will do the puja what harm nothing wrong in it God and me is the father child relation why should I have to hire from somebody else I will cook and offer to my father to my mother to my relatives should I have to every time a hire someone who will cook for me why should I have to so this way so simple relation at the god the Tucker is telling mother suppose they don't allow me to enter into kali temple again well then show me the christian worship from the door of the charge swami vivekananda who you revitalized the Hinduism who gave the life to the Indian psyche when he entered over there they washed the whole temple these people and dear why the Ducks nature is so popular because the Ramakrishna was there like the same temple same column indeed same type of structure so many are there what is there hundreds of temples of cali temples are there everywhere wherever there there will be five bengalis there will be a little more there's no problem then why not all people are going to dictionary sure because of ceramic risch nuh he brought the goddess Kali the divine power the shakti in life and his own image swami vivekananda was not allowed second time to enter these people so in the name of religion we called the goddess Kali mother and we say that it is the creation of our mother then how there will be differences that is exactly what ceramic ich nur is telling he is the god of unity in diversity he is never telling some people will be talking about the unity but that unity means break all others become only one is not like that is the unity in diversity let everyone leave as they are leaving the language the culture the third the religion the behavior let everything be intact only one thing they should have as I am supporting my own part I should also support the other spa to in our Ganges the retreat center we are developing a shrine trail only to teach people these we are Hindus we are the daunting but we also expect that you come and learn that all religions are same there is no differences then we put this there will be Christian there will be muscle man there will be Jew there will be every type of temples if those people come see to but their prey for to their God in the solitude inside the jungle they're allowed so that is the way we have learned because this is the philosophy of Sri Ramakrishna another day the master was seated on the small couch in his room master master writing with his usual beaming countenance all the ten smiling him arrived with kali krishna who did not know where his frame aim was taking him and the name of the Kali kishna he became the senior professor of Sanskrit afterwards this Kali Krishna him related this to see Ramakrishna amy was telling that I will take him to in Bengali it has it nicely tschudi buddy ninja wish anybody means where they sell the wine in those days people are in the habit of that so he thought really how it in the daytime he is taking me so he is confused and then when he came over here saucy Ramakrishna he was so naturally he was so happy cali Krishna he has come over here and see more well master ma che told his friend where you are going to the shops small small thing I will take you to the source of the wine and what is that wine what is that intoxication laughs of God Master mache told it to sri ramakrishna and he laughed and then said the Bliss of worship and communion at God is the true wine the breeze of worship look at the world varsha puja sometimes some people they will be feeling during the puja worshiping is a boring job know when you love it it become blissful how hours together people will be sitting over there praying offering food then the water then the burning incense sticks and then imagining the God has come and sitting over there taking the food and then giving the comment this is not good that was all right this state test is good and that is not as if talking with me and sometimes just like a young child he is not taking the food properly so you have to talk and then you have to feed him like the towers will pass and that's where he said Lisa worship and commune communion with God is the true wine the wine of ecstatic love he is forgetting everything when the people is totally drunk what happened he forgives the whole surroundings he'll be walking on the street without caring for the red light in the griddle green light also he'll try to cross and other people will come and help him because if everything is oblivion he can't see he can understand when the person goes deep into that in the name of God the same thing happens master is telling then he is singing the wonderfully he's telling k Johnny colleague c'mon shadow darshan e na pyar ocean who is there that can understand what mother Kali is even the six darshan errs are powerless to reveal her that translating that song k Johnny Callie c'mon sharra darshan the six systems of Indian philosophy couldn't explain it because unless and until you are realizing you can never understand gharshana means the philosophy by sheikh na sang kee yoga mimamsa and vedanta these are the six approach so this only there he is telling even the six approaches they have explained the whole thing but they cannot fully say because they are also human being what the Philosopher's they're also human being maybe they're realized soul but realized what may be one part of it even the shuka do the man like godiva even he was not knowing the complete God because the moment you know the God completely he is no more infinite he is finite to obviously think that becomes finite is going to destroy so this is the thing if in the through the song he is telling k Johnny cali c'mon shadow darshan in napa duration at mera mera at mccallie prom on pro noble Mouton um cara um cara is the symbol of the brahmin prom on prom on we know that that is the only way we can understand thats called home cada she giati gotta be Raja curry eat jamui ichijo Mon Gotti Gotti means in avery being he is there in avery being in the vedanta also in the bhagavad-gita that same sri krishna is also telling i belong to everyone in every every being that you see is nothing but me the same type of knowledge again and again then ceramic ISNA is talking about another master said again the one goal of life is to cultivate love for God one goal that is that will be the only to cultivate the love for God the lab that the milkmaids the milk main and the cowherd boys of the brindavan fail for krishna why brindavan is so famous they never read books they never read philosophy they never knew anything when the wood da became he's a philosopher he's a gani and when he saw that all the gopis are crying for Krishna he said why you were crying he is all there in every being within your are you try to see Krishna in all being concentrate your mind on Krishna you will see then the gopis they were illiterate she took bart said we don't have our minds with us our mind has gone with the krishna how can I concentrate the mind the ended of understood I won't understand this thing this is the love he's not or she is not having the mind itself because that mind has been given to God I cannot think I cannot do unless he's same thing we have seen in the personality of Sri Ramakrishna anyone is coming to him anything he wants to do immediately ran to Kali temple mom he has come to give me dick shiny stealing he will give me diksha what shall I do then he will come like a proud child mother told she has send you for me give me diksha you get it can you imagine so this way he is only mentioning and singing not words he's leaving the truth and master said the goal of life is to cultivate love for God the love of the milkman the milkman covered boys when Krishna went away to mathura the cowards roamed about weeping bitterly because of their separation from him that is called love for God how many of us can feel like that and he's singing again through the songs decay alarm at Naveen Rakhal naveen Tohru dhal pourri knowing what sekulic or a bali coat arrived I can I is a the song just now I saw a youthful cover while a young cop in his arms there he stood by one hand holding the branch of young tree where are you brother can I these cowards they were totally different they were not slaughtering the cows and selling the meat of the cows they were only milking the cows so they'll love for the cows were totally different and from that love when they started loving the Krishna was also living with them along with them as a cowherd boy the whole love went to him and when he is not there they are feeling that they have lost everything so that we can I'm can I means the Krishna then afterwards the ceramic ishness singing bali kothari Vikon I a bar Cobb we can I be Ranieri the moment i utter car he couldn't say the whole name car 9 only three later named only he said car and went into that ecstasy and he's crying couldn't speak the full name couldn't pronounce the full name so much of love and devotion and that is the way one can master masha he when he was listening to these words of the ramakrishna and the song he was also led in with love and tears rolled down see Rama kushna then he was sitting in another place and in the english translation they have not completely translated nickel ananda ji maharaj is having two books one is full another is a priest but the abridged edition here it has not mentioned all these things right directly it has gone to come algo tier and conversation with veena with the sugar in between there's a full chapter and wonderful chapter I don't know why they have not and the complete the book also they have not translated a wonderful portion that see Ramakrishna came to prana Krishna Makka pakka in the shampoo cool bharti he came to shampoo core shampoo kusa plays again the bug bahasham puku or just nearby neighborhoods the side by side there salam o Krishna came to prana Krishna he was a very good devotee and ceramic ish needs to come and call the see how he is propagating he is going to one place and calling the devotees of that idea he is going to another place and when calling the river and the calcutta in different parts he is roaming and calling the devotees of that locality and that should be the idea otherwise if you are not telling the philosophy song should be there merry men should be there food should be there but philosophy should be there discussion should be there question answer should be there otherwise how people will learn so this is the way see Ramakrishna it's wonderful planning is a man to man person to person in the same place he is going talking he went to that prana Krishna to a second a brief and he went over there and SAT over there and he's talking with the devotees that is not completely there in the big book also see Ramakrishna his sitting today see Rama Krishna has come to Calcutta he's sitting with devotees in the parlor on the first floor of prana krishnam of mukherjee's shampoo core house having just eaten a meal with the devotees it is Sunday second april' 1882 see this Sunday's only used to go because that was the holiday in Calcutta also that time the British Ertz the offices that the Sunday used to go and when there is a food naturally all people is to come to take the Prashad and they're free when you have to go back to houses and cooking and all that natural the ladies it would have been difficult for them to come people are also feeling hungry they will go so there's to come AB the Prasad and then the discussion now this discussing bright fortnight of chaitra the time between one and two in the afternoon captain leaves in the same neighborhood and Tucker wants to go to his house after resting at branch ishness captain means he was the ambassador of Nepal Nepal was a free country so naturally it is to give an ambassador the ambassador of Nepal he was a big man Tucker is to go to him too he used to come to see Ramakrishna so we can understand how he was related in the society very ordinary people at the very at the same time very high position people too then he wants to visit a shop same the same day he is going to so many places in his house call Lily cottage prana Krishna is sitting in his parlor Rahman amante de Surendra Gerindra sure indras brother Rahul Balarama aim and other devotees are present who had the present why he is mentioning again and again in every chapter because that is the authenticity historicity all these people were there the moment this book was published everybody appreciated and has ideas it happened nobody contradicted so that proves the authenticity of the book some gentlemen of the neighborhood and other in invited guests are also there they are all anxious to hear what Taku has to say ceramic Asia they are all sitting see Ramakrishna says Taku turtle in a lovingly distance a God and His glory this world is certainly his glory in Bengali cinema Krishna stealing Isher arta oh I sharjah assure after we shot Joe here they have translated glory a jogger tar a charger this world is certainly his glory it's not that good translation this word is his glory they say I sharjah means glory that way there but actually he is giving the expression in a different way God Himself giving the expression / are with the Opera Vita and in Gita also recovered get also same thing we find and Saddam Krishna never read Gita but he knew the whole original thing how realization this is the important thing even without reading anything going to anybody he could say the truth and which was totally in commune with the other scriptures and other religious teachers because it was truth and he realized it and he's telling we should Judy Keyshia Cole apologize Salem concealing his splendor and glory people forget everything else jar we should you Tokiko Gina but they don't look for him who is the master of all these reaches once some people do tease they were following show me turian and Richie and there was a beautiful house they're all wrongs and rummage errands and they saw a beautiful house and the brahmacari perhaps said what a nice house immediately Shami stopped and looked at him and said why you were appreciating this house the you are not appreciating the beauty that has been created in the mind of the people by God when you were thinking about this even sometimes when their money is lying over there salam occasional never liked the devotee should pick it up why you are peeking it's not my money why should I pick it up let it be there I have no concern with those things so that way you have to think this jagath I sharjah some people are so beautifully looking very handsome very rich very educated what is that to me I usually love my god i only love my god what ash water I'll do with all this so the places that we go beautiful scenery and all that that's okay but who has created this jagat that is cinema Krishna is telling jar wishard Joe who has created this beauty pakka krajina i went to calgary from calgary they took me to a beautiful place and that was a long weekend hundreds we when he went over there it was totally full the he was not getting even a play one place to keep his god we had to go so much a long and climb there he'll there only one place was lived that to some p1 people I come I'm a group of people the left there immediately we had to keep our car and we had to walk down and all this what is there a glacier water is coming down and the glacier water going somewhere else both sides as a heels is beautiful nothing is good and people will be there and they are all going to with the preparation that they will stay in the nite majority of them they will stay outside only camping and they will climb they will sit over there they will eat they will drink they will dance they will lit a fire and then afterwards they will come down okay what so that is the thing we have to understand after these words long weekend nice long weekend we look again we'll go to Alaska will go to these are there after that heart when you come back no peace in our mind why because we have not gone to the root what is the root who has created this beauty suppose going over there if we see it meditate sing the praise of God try to be calm and quiet then we'd better we will see we can remember them long before we went to Gangotri and it even the Ganga was frozen that time we walked over the Ganga to pay respect to Ghana what to do because Ganga is totally frozen and it is hardly morning at about two o'clock and we walked over the Ganges SAT over there and the Sun rose my god so two different type of reflections of the sunlight on the ISIS then slowly slowly I started melting then the Ganga is flowing and all the mongs there so many in different places all alone tremendous cold they're all sitting marsden meditation we were having some of the worm clothings and the blankets many of them bare body sitting over there meditating meditating hours past no one looked at all this here and there they were all waiting for the water to come down from the go mukha the moment the water started pouring down we went and took the water and so this is the one type of that remains in our mind when you were coming back the joy of that place beauty of course the scenery natural beauty there is good but you have to find out that is sharp see Rama Krishna is telling we will read only this comic con gian book the shock aleejack into Duke oh oh shanthi be shi xiong sharjah no by shahla killed oh no Cudahy Egbert poorly are rockin I da means the wildering will pool is constantly the water constantly roaming and tracking down even the board big boat if it goes near that it will go down but there where nobody knows so this samsara this wall that we see name fame in all these things that we see afterwards nothing remains nothing remains but if you once go into that with all your mind you cannot come out every time it will drag Sosa Ramakrishna is telling that you have to be very very careful then one devotee is asking icon who by the way he was he was explaining the naturally those who are devotee they were afraid now R it is really every time every time we are taking bart and every time we are dying every time we are having so much of friendship relations relatives and every time we are leaving everything and again taking birth again going like this going on and on the moment we understand it we are afraid da Bagh neat optum everything is burning I don't want this God please give me peace where can I get the peace this man is asking why Kanu pie how we can save ourselves ceramic ISNA the famous reply Shahu Shanga are piranhas he is telling the to this time the company of the holy person and the prayer in between another two are there can you say that what are the another two he told in the first chapter newgen gosh which are correct and the sadhu sanga means the holy company and after list thing you have to go alone we have to sit alone you have to ponder over that and then which are you to analyze the thing accept it and then create God how we can pray when we can pray when you are sure that God is alone there sometimes when your heart and then we think why God has done this to me because he wants you to think about him so that is the idea next day again we will read from here neden genom nityam on antelope um bak tonneau compa Drita be crumby ish Avatara para Misha medium tamarama krishnam she reshawna mama oh shanthi shanthi shanthi hurry he owned that said sri ramakrishna our eponymous to next Tuesday we will read this gospel of
