[143: Panchama Veda 143- The Gospel of Sri RamaKrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOKKZICNwyI)

good evening let us chant this mantra and start discussion on the bunch of Aveda the gospel Takahama rhythm dr. G venom go vvv rhythm calm of Shaba stubborn among golem srimad aciton booby green and DA holy dodging aha in the last class we were studying the sea ramakrishna he is discussing about the manifestation of God in human form so the greatest manifestation of God is through his incarnations the devotee should worship and serve an incarnation of God so this is the way he is giving an idea how to understand God the completely the idea of God is totally different completely different and usually normally we think that is the problem though whenever I think about anything in this world whatever may be the subtlest of the circletine in this world we have some option there is a time space and causation but when you think about God there is no such option how to develop fate how to understand this ability of God so the God comes in the form of human being and he comes and manifest as an avatar incarnation of God we are all manifested from God but there is a difference so that is exactly what the Ramakrishna is mentioning when you're speaking about the God and to make it that the vastness of the knowledge in the last time we read 354 page it is said like sages like guitar trio and Java rasa did not return to the relating plane after having the vision of Brahman he is not mentioning the God he is mentioning the Brahman the soul the ultimate God is much lower concept from the Brahman and it comes God Himself comes in that form and then he is creating his sustaining he is destroying all these actions are possible when he is coming let me down and having three gunas etcetera all that we have discussed and maybe we'll discuss in future again and again but here to make us understand how difficult it is to really understand the Brahman he said these are the sages even after the realization of the Brahman the source they could not come back to this normal life according to some people who could ever taste it only a drop of that ocean a Brahman consciousness here he is mentioning Brahman consciousness that Brahman consciousness cheek that is a different thing but the Brahman consciousness is unthinkable and now in present condition so to make it easy for the ordinary people that same consciousness taking the human form here he says there was an infinite field beyond the high wall he gives an example four friends tried to find out what was beyond the wall three of them one after other climbed the world saw the field bashed into loud laughter and drop to the other side it was so joyful thing so elect wrapped him so they climb they saw they forget the back others are waiting they jumped into that joyfulness these three could not give any information above the field only the fourth man came back and told people about it it's tremendous control and unselfishness when we are reaching over there to the god resource also attractive and joyful even sometimes we sing the song of God together and we dance in the name of God all we sometimes see the movie of the great personalities we are moved so much by dad but when we see the real happiness of God what really happens to him so only the fourth man came back he is like those who retain their bodies even after attaining Ramayana so those who retain their body body means I consciousness and is so difficult because after reaching over the edge is impossible to remember that this consciousness this body consciousness and the consciousness of the others absolutely it becomes nearly so why I am Telling getting this just to have a glimpse an idea about that absolute joy but these people they come back come back why because of the love in order to teach others that is the love the love of others they are coming back why not for themselves they're coming back for the benefit of others after that great joy after the great knowledge they could mix into that but instead they are coming back and they're killing others there is something over there if you follow this path then you can see then see Ramakrishna commenting divine incarnations belong to this class this class means this the fourth person who could retain his own personality even after seeing even after enjoying even of the feeling realizing the oneness of bliss is still thought I must have to go and help others that's why shall we be vacant to say to give the definition of God unselfishness is God what is God unselfishness the moment one can become completely unselfish he become God we think of God in a different way but this is the ultimate in the unconscious completely unselfishness this is then he was telling all this and ultimately it came over here he said so the greatest manifestation of God is through his incarnations the British manifestation of God is through even Ganesha why does the good retain their own personalities when everything is melting the earth they were retaining their own personality coming back and telling others the tremendous love for other filling for others and that is why when xiaomi Vivekananda is stealing promising in this way when there will be a one dog unfeigned I will come back can you imagine the way they are thinking that is tremendous love the vendors concern so the Incarnation so the greatest manifestation of God is through his incarnations the devotee should worship and serve an incarnation of God then he said not all by any means can recognize an incarnation of God assuming a human body this is what the Ramakrishna is mentioning here long long bad shri krishna also said like that and very peculiarly you will find the issue a good person is here was very difficult to recognize them but some other people and wonderfully they can put things and people will go to him but in reality is not good in the name of God in the name of spirituality and as because he can manipulate he can put the world thing in the beautiful world in such a way they can extract people will go to him they are so clever each and every one of us are so clever when you go to market to purchase anything we always first we try to get the branded thing and we are sure that this will be good and then otherwise we judge and then only we accept like that everything we do before getting anything but when we talk about God realization of God except in a bad then somehow we become very childlike and we accept those people who could really sing and dance and embrace you that is the thing and that's why Shankaracharya in the BH Romani and almost in the almost beginning on that one or two sloka he is telling is very difficult three things monoshock nakshatra and the third is Maha Purusha Shama straya the company of the Maha Purusha by the grace of God only one can have and that is the reason is really very very difficult so many people hundreds and thousands of them they are coming there reading their hearing but they are not taking it into their mind they always go for those type of talks and then this being their time over there ultimately they cannot reach anywhere and that's why see Ramakrishna is constantly searching for those genuine souls and guiding them a virgin and imamura ma who seemed the new maasdam in the bhagavad-gita shri krishna say it is very difficult Mura those who are deluded did youdid in many things some people go to the that church a temple or to go to listen to that person where many people are going just because oh there he is so popular there must be so they go only in that way without understanding what religion why he is that why I am Telling this because the Ramakrishna Shri Krishna all they're giving the caution that this is the ultimate path ultimate steps that we take in our life and we go over there we spend some time we try to understand then we jungle love then come back frustated completely wastage of time and we can try many other things but in the spiritual life how many times you will try at those ways complete wastage of your energy very very sincerely we have to think why should we accept these and why should we not accept that so that is the reason in bhagavad-gita three thousand years before shri krishna he said of a Jonin time' Mura mana seem to know bottom when the God in the human form I have come but the mudra those who are deluded they cannot recognize me now we are worshipping the Krishna now because so many great souls they have come and they have expressed explained the dc's God so now we can understand to some extent and go back to just out of popularity oh there are so many songs are there Mira vaginally then we go but we do not know actually what is krishna but when you go when we learn when we hear when we practice slowly slowly love for Lord Krishna comes and this coming Sunday will be discussing about Bhagwan Shree Krishna because the Jang master me exacty see the date will be on Monday America Monday but in Monday we won't get any people so we will celebrate in the Sunday morning 11 to 12 so we will be discussing about Shri Krishna and singing bhajan about him except etc and he came on the cry of Bhutan arm ma machine there Oh obstacle he came in the human form why because again another ayah that the story that saddam krishna say the fourth person he came back restraining his tremendous joy that was waiting over there he came back why uh nagoya just to have the love for the people for the others they have not heard about it and we have found out it's not that only we should enjoy let me go and kill other people also and this is unselfishness and he said ultimately man-mana bhava mad-bhakto on the Georgie mom dommage guru you become my devotee why I am God myself Mon Mon up above mother after you think about me become devoted to me see Ramakrishna said that devotee should worship this is the reason he said the Incarnation goes into that class the greatest manifestation of God through his incarnation and devotee should worship and serve an incarnation of God as long as he leaves then otherwise it is impossible you won't be able to understand then I find that he is going on talking about and expressing the love to love an incarnation of God that is enough that is the topic that I mentioned to love an incarnation of God that is enough what ecstatic blob the gopis had for Krishna here he mentioned the Krishna an incarnation of God when the incarnation of God there are different incarnations the conception of in the Hindu is a different type of incarnation of the manifested incarnation means manifestation so in the beginning how it was and slowly coming down and ultimately but afterwards we mean when we get a chance we will discuss how the things that change so the Vishnu was the main God and afterward in September I will given retreat on these I will be discussing about him Thoreau will discuss about how things changed there in the passage of time the thinking changes so it was Vishnu and the Rama and Krishna was incarnation of Vishnu afterwards the popularity of Krishna became so much we started telling in the Bhagavata Krishna stood of the Vance I am but he has the Dhamma Krishna is mentioning to love an incarnation of God that is enough then as an example he is mentioning ah what extractive love the gopis had for Krishna in the if you go to Brindavan you always talk about the Krishna and Radha the whole thinking all the time going on chanting the name of Krishna and Radha they say have not tested twenty-four hours non-stop there will be given it to me the song of their Krishna somebody or rather someone or other here and there going on if you go in parikrama there are small parikrama and bigger prick Rama that means the long route and all the small route in the next city you are going white because they are the god lived he played he stayed over there so naturally when you are moving you are not just walking he was remembering those things this is the place where he did this that is the place where you are so it goes on in this way I use down when a person goes thinks about the three Ramachandra and when he's thinking about the rahmatan at the same time he's thinking about all those things that he has done so this way slowly you are remembering only God and nothing else so this is the way was I was reading you know different type of messages all the time coming in nowadays in smartphone you can stop it people will be going on sending different type of messages but sometimes that these are many very good the one lady came and he was she was complaining to this the Poojari the priest of the temple said I lacked love to come over here but now I am thinking that I should not come then the Poojari the priest acts while my daughter what happened see the here the people they come over here and then they will be posing and taking the photo they will be talking about many other things they are singing the Virgin they are not concentrating quietly you're so disturbing this temple so I am thinking I should go somewhere else or I'll be in my room quietly I'll think about God then the Poojari said give me a chance come tomorrow at least for one day so tomorrow she came when the pooja he gave her a full glass full of water I'm going to offer this to God can you please carry this water without spilling even a drop around this temple and come back and give it to me I would offer to God and she very seriously hold that glass and she went around and came back and gave it to the Poojari and the pooja reaction and assured that there is not a single drop or no I am sure I was completely concentrated or very good and now when you are walking did you notice that people had talked about something else instead of God that disturb you I didn't because I all my concentration was in that water you told that you were going to offer it to God but I should not believe in a draw so naturally all consent concentration on the water did you see the people who are snapping taking photos no I didn't notice that but that way whenever you come to the shrine to the temple just look at God and don't bother about others so you will find the peace you will find that loneliness so that is your mind that is the concentration when I was reading the story I was remembering one sharmaji with whom we have for a long time in of the custom in our formative years and he is to tell about our one of our resident Swami ji he was sick he was admitted in a hospital our own Hospital in Shiva petition just behind that and there below there is a place and all the poor people then leave mostly the rickshaw puller and all that and in the midnight also they'll be shouting fighting and using the abusive languages it is very very difficult it is not like America calm and quiet everywhere the whole mind the whole city is alive so difficult so naturally this young man one day he told resident sharmaji that shrug senior Swami come it is so difficult to even to sleep in the night hold the disturbances but anyway that we can manage but in the night also we cannot take sleep for four or five hours so much of disturbances I think it is better for us to go back to bed alone even for your health sake then the Swami - do you hear all those things but I never heard I consent it on God and I never listen I'd never hear anything anywhere so that is the thing the concentration the wanly concentrate on God what happens all the qualities of God comes so incarnation they come they do so many things and they come and they do they perform they say according to that particular time and the people and then it goes to eternity so that is the reason that is the waste Ramakrishna is deeming what was the love that you must take the love ecstatic love the gup-e dad for Krishna this to forget their own bodies they are ladies all those things before God is to run only to listen sometimes come people they depict a wrong picture about it this is wrong as because it is love so some people depicted that that lady and oh man and the man is not man oh man is the love for God and the love for God forgave their body consciousness and when you are not having the body consciousness then what what is the human the male body or female body is nothing like that so that we should understand see ramakrishna went into that mode and he was thinking Oh Krishna you are the soul of my soul I cannot think of anything else in the ramayana we find the hanuman this all methodological way the story that gives anumana he is opening up his jails and people saw is only three rama and nothing else he'll agree honey true story fall they are mentioning that Ramana was not having any other personalities accepts Islam he thought rahmatan brings each and every moments for him in the whole world it was nothing but Saddam urgent krishna also same way again continuing the master said when krishna suddenly disappeared in the act of dancing and playing with the gopis they were beside themselves with grief the object of love that serrano krishna is mentioning so much of love so much of devotion so naturally when that is out how people will think a fish out of water that is the explanation the way the game and if you put a fish on the floor you will find maybe is a very costly carpet is there but the free she will jump and it's long for the water and similarly a devotee even if you put him in the white house even then it will jump like that fish I like to go back to the seclusion where I can take the name of God I can love God I can sing for God so that is the love for God pushing a Maya table they started seeing them so each and every one the started feeling that I am the Krishna and they started looking at the tree and they say to the trees o tree you must be a great Harmeet you must be you must have seen Krishna otherwise why do you stand here motionless as if absorbed in Samadhi this is how they saw everything is nothing but the manifestation of this in God when they saw that tree they thought it must be a hermit must be a sage standing over there motionless because completely absorbed in Sri Krishna looking at art covered with green grass they say Oh art you must have seen Christian otherwise why does your hair stand on end the grasses they saw and they are thinking in that way you must have enjoyed the thrill of his touch looking at the Madhava creeper they said o Madhava give us back our mother the gopis were intoxicated with ecstatic love for Krishna a crude or cream to the Brindavan to take Krishna and Balarama to Mathura when they mounted the chariot the gopis clung to the wheels they would not let the chariot boom saying these see Ramakrishna Stang assuming that attitude of akrura akrura she was driving the chariot so he wanted to take Krishna away Krishna and Balarama his brother and the Gopi is all the devotees they came and they were stopping by clenching the the wheel then he sang whole not whole not the charges will is it the wings that make it move don't you understand that without the will of God nothing moves if the Krishna says no you think I have any power to take him anywhere so Donald or owner of the chakra a lot of the chakra Charlie chakra means the wheel please don't hold the wheel Donna don't hold it do you think the wheel is moving out of his own no but the mover of his will is Krishna though by whose will the worlds are moved the beautiful song some of the fingers the singing in a wonderful way is it the wheel that makes it move Salaam o Krishna again repeating by whose will the worlds are moved the driver moves the chariot that his master's bidding I feel deeply touched by these lines some business is feeling like that so if we look at our life where we were born where we grew up what was the family what was all our neighborhood our friends our teachers our school our college and all these things and then we are going on moving from here and they're developing friendship with others developing relationships and everything in different places if you think quietly as if someone is putting it in this way we are just acting in that suddenly a thought came I saw an opportunity I tried to get that I got that again again again we are all moving if we think in this way it develops the faith in God there is God he is moving everything why should I have to think then whatever have I done naturally I have to suffer or have to enjoy I am bound but now that by the grace of God I have come to know about these the secret of work I must be very very careful and that way I must try sometimes some people they come and lament oh so many ds and this I don't think of it there are so many babies even after birth there time the parents cannot take care or The Situation's is so different they died but we were protected we got a beautiful parents they protected us we got a wonderful family they were all helping us now slowly slowly you people have come to America it's not so easy to come to America millions of people who are there just dreaming to come over here you came here you got the opportunity even when you are not happy what else will make you happy them and whatever the other things have happened happened to think of God and pray to God I must have done something wrong my boss now that I have come to you and understood you I pray to you please help me please help me please with me each and every moment that I should remember you make that situation make my mind in that way so that I can only be remember you and before my last breathe before my death I can see you I can talk to you I can realize you I can understand you why not in this life I should do because I am you I am your child I'm your son I'm your daughter I have every right to see the face of my father my mother why not one of the great xiaomi is agora more Krishna mission is to serve Maharajah money baby and you know in those days our ladies just to cover their faces even today if you go to the villages particularly North India they'll be covering their faces they won't allowed us so he used to go is to see only the feet of the mother EE feet then he didn't say anything right there when he used to come back is to say in such a way so the mother can listen mother can hear a my heart should Marshall means the is the brother of the husband so usually the ladies will never show their face to him out of respect do you think I am have a suit that she is not showing her face to me I'm a son even then the mother didn't allow but just before the last day when she knew that she would be closing and go back to the owned aboard she sewed the face to that son so that is the way if we bring will surely see and very ordinary person never meditated never took any mantra or read the Holy Scripture he was a scavenger in that temple garden even then he has a great faith in see Rama Krishna devotee shoots up the incarnation of God Rama Krishna stealing that man I don't know where they are these are not but out of his that his work he was so devoted he started believing ceramic isn't so difficult really to understand the personal only man the great personality when we are living in his company the contemporary people it is very difficult because you only see that ordinary things in him oh he is eating he is meeting he is laughing he's going there doing this all that we do the history he cannot be a very holy man a special person that we think him that way but that man he thought no one day when he founds the ramakrishna all alone and he was the brahman he was a barrier bloom caste and he came and he lied down at his feet and said sir won't you save me Ramakrishna said what do you want and he was so clever he didn't say give me my son should get a good job there should be no poverty he was in poverty used to live in a video Denis house but he never cared for those things he says before my death you should come and take me to the heaven where you live and that really happened so this is the way it goes is not only that we are making them cinema Krishna he is thinking Oh mother I have no one else to blame alas I think in the will these very hands are dark karma-phalam those guru no anger the same this you cannot blame anyone army shock also surely do this Mori Shama dose guru no ego I know you don't come many of you understand the Gauley but the beautiful song the moment you read this word you feel like singing I wish you could have this songs very hard so it's constantly reminding you be careful be careful be careful whatever thought you were thinking that is going and making the follow the reserve whatever you work you are doing there's also making the result everything your thought and action is accumulating be careful how to discriminate how to be careful whatever you do questions in nan de Xiang ji Grande arche angarchand Sokka mission Paulo forest region didn't no one mentioned omission rupee in the bhagavad-gita whole thing not a single thing he has left Krishna he is telling even the blinking of your eyes whatever you do offer to me so in that way it is not that according to the least we should do that means every time whatever you do we should offer to God now we are reading the book after that we always always say eponymous to orphan I am giving it to you because when we are reading a holy book obviously some good result will come I don't like to give that also I like to give that to you all but sometimes I am making some mistake that also Greece take and forgive me so I am NOT taking anything then we want what you say Ramakrishna again he is telling a story a man has a beautiful bucket full of water and you were sitting outside the village and the people who are going over there with their clothings and he was asking make this a green he was dipping in that and giving the green one mixed might not read he was making great but the just clean water he was showing the all these miracles one person was sitting quietly observing then when everyone satisfied went back and the magician turned to him and say what do you want then he said give me that color by which you have colored yourself it was the power of creating those things so if we want God these and that small thing we will give obviously but why not ask God himself then everything is over a bigger came to shamrit at birth adverbs are there's a story and that time he was praying to Allah the God and the beggar was sitting over there and waiting wind he will finish his prayer he will then ask then he hard that some God he is the king of gaming's he was begging to God Oh God give me blessing so that I can win that war I can capture that person I can administer a good way I can have this much of wealth so that I can maintain so he was going on begging one after another all the lists so the bigger God up and he was going away by the time almost he the but saw the king he finished his prayer in hey you came here to ask for something where you are not asking what you are doing a bit wait and coming then he said said I don't big from a bigger my god what what you say you are also begging to God so I am understood that the God is the highest who can give so there's a hindi song daata eak Crom so the beautiful song is there the daughter the giver is only as Amma why you are asking this man and that man is better to go and pray to God and see ramakrishna promised the Avatara of the present day he promised the manifestation of God in cinema Krishna form promised God listened to everything only one thing is this very complete faith and second tears with a prayerful heart crying if you can breathe your break will be surely accepted and he is sitting is even the Nanta his guru the Ballentine and he was a man of profound knowledge the song moved him to tears though he didn't understand its meaning look at the same same song the same song douche Karan I go bah Oh mother I am I cannot blame anyone it is my fault only so when cinema Krishna was singing in Bengali his guru or do it in guru who was from the U P but so naturally he couldn't understand the Bengali but he could feel the things and the meaning of that song in this way to it he started crying moved him to tears though he didn't understand the meaning but melodeon also waved when I sang the songs of Ram Prasad about the Divine Mother they were great scholars this to debate about in the Bonanza but the heart was so soft the moment is to hear about this there's Takei the cinema Krishna River into certain place someone said to me nobody sings the name of God there now you see a different picture we see God in the Incarnation we see God in the temples and churches and mosque we see God in the indifferent holy places now someone has come and he is complaining like nobody and nobody seems the name of God there sonication was talking about the song here is it it is no holy atmosphere he complained no sooner did he say these then I perceived that it was God alone who had become all living beings a devotee a personal God that is the relation but the moment he said those people are not that way holy are devoted immediately his mind went into that equate in condition and he saw that God has also become those people so don't blame others don't criticize others whatever they are doing is the will of God let them do in their own way you think about yourself only in the spiritual life that is also a great selfishness I have to think about myself so what I am doing was look at that boy he is not doing look at that man he is not doing you needed to bother about that as a God will everything is going on no sooner did he say that this then I perceived that it was God alone who had become all living beings again I perceived that living beings are like different flowers with various layers of petals they are also revealed to me as bubbles some big some small this is the ceramic is not this is the speciality of siddhaloka Schnurr this time that God has come at the Ramakrishna he is not showing any miracle as such like Krishna lifted the hill about the hill he didn't do that the Ramachandra just by his name it was written and the stones were floating on the water long thing you didn't show anything like that but it changed the mind of the people thousands of people he changed the mind that is the miracle and here he said I find some sometimes that living beings are like so many pills made of individual consciousness in device consciousness once I was on my way to Bardo on from Camargo cool at one place I ran to the meadow to see how living beings are sustained I saw ants calling there it appeared to me that every place will was filled with consciousness look at it the cinema Krishna wished to worship Govinda wish to worship Kali whose two worships the Dhamma Chandra as completely personal gods and goddesses taxi ramakrishna is finding consciousness everywhere sometimes some people they talk about that this way even through the devotion we come to that point where I see that ultimate consciousness everywhere ultimate knowledge of Vedanta consciousness everywhere this is Groot in the life of ceramic dish I have become I am here he saved while describing this way the vision of different divine forms the master went into an ecstatic state and said I have become I am here so that is the whole ultimate on Twitter I and he so I am he who can say something some people just like that you will say I am here anyone you can say like that but to understand that you have to go through so much of different processes so that you can understand just Archon like a parrot or do the big answer is the last world before that we had to develop faith in God existence of the consciousness who has become God and then he that God has created this universe and the manifestation of the God in different forms and that's why I was dreaming I still like dream that we should have a place where all the religion should be defeated because this is the sadhana Krishna no never complained against anyone all paths are leading to the same goal in the human society there will be an emitting as because the politics is because of society as because of the language as because of economy so many other things are there so obviously we cannot we can never even imagine someone is dreaming that day will come when each and every one of us will be framed I think it's not possible because that is already there within us that images with their liking disliking will be there but not in the name of religion at least in the name of politics or economy in sociology and these and that if we are fighting ok but speak the region because the particularly the religion when we are talking about God thinking about God and praying to God how in the name of God we can become so critical in others so that we must understand but this is high time we must understand this we should not mix never ever mix religion with politics religion with economy religion with something else the religion is complete the all of human society if we destroy that there will be no chance for the human society to survive religion is love the love that manifesting the hearts of the mother and father the love that is there in the hearts of the frames in the heart of the lovers the dad love coming together that complete total love is nothing but God how can how can we complain about it so this we should understand and hear so I think it is time is up so ceramic Krishna is mentioning about it and it says that so Abbate is not saw my young father birth is not doing there is taking the form taking birth it never say like that a booty is not consciously coming down above above means below as if he was somewhere above and is coming below and saw a Bettina saw my ayah and he is just thinking putting that Maya on him and then coming down we are forced to come each and every being that is taking the bird they are forced to because of the karma fella somewhere good somewhere bad so different they perform different types of features different type of lifestyle because of all that God has nothing to do with all those things he never did anything he is not having any kind of Allah but why then he is taking the human form we should not make any mistake that he is also bound by karma no nothing he is coming here only a Bettina saw my ayah in the Bhagavata it says in the gopal toponi is another scripture he is asking in question Sahib Oh Gavin hood Turkish city that God where he is living because when the moment that God the conception of God is there then where is he very easily believes this place that place what he is living saw he Bhagavad that God could wear this tepee living and is giving the answer saying they're giving the answer mo him nice way Mahim nice way there's a small book a very nice book about master Dominique written by one of our Swamiji to sway my him name three means that God is living in his own glory he you cannot say that God is here and he is not there it is not everywhere sway my evening Mahim means way he is living if we say he or see or eat as because it is the consciousness living in its own glory Magna so that may mean in the suti in the better we find a come Eva a diem become evil a DTM having no to eco peace and Buddha you've got e iike a Pisan even though it is one Buddha in many party party means we see in that way is all the manifestation that we see is not not real that is the Barrentine way of explaining but the devotees they say why not God is all-powerful why he should not so when they say how come the God that all-powerful all-pervading God coming into one form is it possible in reply to that three logu Bhagavad our memories of another book it's not the father were you three logu father but humble there's the name of the book si lo Guba Guba Tom Rita he says if you say like that even actually you are denying all powerfulness of God that you cannot do todd grisham chip in our shop thing if you are asking how can God take form let me see us challenging God that he is not having that power to take the form the addition to be Nashik team now seated parami shaka param Asia forum aja aja means that God all-pervading God all powerful God the moment you say Asia Ishwara all-powerful and forum the higher above that nothing can be there and at the same thing you are telling God cannot take the form is a bland screaming like pink otherwise you say God is not having all power he is having some power we can make a list that these are the power that God is having that you are powerful in the God you are making the list for God so moment you say so this is the argument audio piece under by art MA Bhutan army sure hope is on recruiting zombie style some Gaga me at MoMA I on this of course I am coming in my power so we will be discussing it in our next Sunday we will be having some talk on the Sri Krishna but that babe instead of going into the this type of different type of question answer we will talk about the Krishna his contribution and will be singing the budget so today we can conclude by quoting just mentioning not quoting just mentioning a beautiful later that was written by Spinoza a very famous western philosopher to his friend Alden bark to Oldenburg the Spinoza is writing dear Spinoza is mentioning I can accept Jesus is a very good person son of God incarnation of God is too much for me to accept actually this is BR the followers of the path of knowledge and also in the brahma sutra fast sloka that sleep bomb baby is explaining same thing is telling God cannot take this human form it is impossible so this is also present were there so when you go down and the all the shivananda all please look at that photo of the ramakrishna and below we have quoted one of
