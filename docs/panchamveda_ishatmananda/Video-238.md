[239: Panchama Veda 239 : God is Your Own Mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axvjPltVTFE)

namaskar they are devotees and friends let us begin our the weekly class on the panchama veda the gospel of sirama krishna as usual we will chant this mantra from the gopigita and then we will read and discuss tabukatham so we are reading from the chapter 31 title advice to ishaan on page 611 of the gospel of siram krishna written by swami translated by swami nikhilanandaji so we are reading from here what are you still here are you still performing the sandhya master suramar krishna he is asking ishan and those who are attending the class regularly you know the kishan ishan he came and he met siram krishna then he went to visit the kali temple and he was doing as normally those devout hindus they do in the evening time when the sun is sitting they'll be sitting quietly taking the name of their god or goddess the ishta devata so he was doing that sirama krishna came and he made him he saw him performing his daily sadhana and then now surama krishna is telling him what are you still here then he said are you still performing the sandhya now ladder sandhya not sadhana sandhya what is the sandhya santa means in the morning when the the night is going away day is approaching that is the time is called sandhya and then in the evening also the sandhya this sandhya that usually the the devotees they perform and taking the name of god or sometimes performing little puja this they do he's telling still performing sandhya why takur is asking this question that why he is asking this question krishna himself gave that reply through a beautiful song and what is that song i will read from the translation and it says it's a bengali song why should i go to ganga or gaya or kashi kanchi or prabhas so long as i can breathe my last with kali's name upon my lips so that is the point when one can continuously take the name of god and he doesn't need to go to any pilgrimage or any spiritual practice nothing necessary why we practice spiritual practices to withdraw the mind from the world to give it to god and we try to repeat the name of god and then when i am repeating the name of god try to meditate on god or god is my chosen idol chosen deity so that is the now if i can continuously take the name of god and can remember that god or goddess then why should i have to take that in a particular time why should i have to go to different holy places to remember the gaia ganga kashi kanchi it is all very holy places of india all the devout hindus all they will go at least once in a lifetime they will surely go to visit these places and goya is a place of the vishnu and ganga we know that holy river but people they go to the source of ganga and they go and bathe over there the gangotri it is not necessary to whom who is constantly taking the name of god why because when we go to those holy places that is the time that is the moment we take the name of god and we forget the creation so that is the reasons ramakrishna asking the devotee you are still practicing that means you have not developed the love for god so that is the way one always think in this way why should i go to gaia or ganga et cetera take the name of god constantly take the name of god constantly that is what suramar krishna is asking creator and the creation in vedanta and also in the vaisnava they always they think in this way the teaching of the hindus are very clear you should go to the creator and how you can go to creator think one process the creation is completely false the path of knowledge the creation is not there it is maya this this is just like false thing the magician's magic think in that way path of knowledge the creation is a god's creation and it is his business i have nothing to do i will go to my god that is devotional path just thinking in two different ways but the goal is the same what is the goal the ultimate the god the supreme the brahman so that is the teaching the surama krishna the great guru he is teaching in this way how long must a man continue the sadhana the spiritual practice is called sadhana in sanskrit what are the spiritual practices reading from the holy books meditating on the teachings of those holy book or taking the holy name of god praying to god visiting some holy places giving charity helping the poor or the needy these are all only work and that is called sadhana but then there is another higher state continuously keeping the mind under control because mind wants to get agitated wants to react when i see something immediately my mind says no i should say this i should go and tell this or i should do this there should not be any reaction that control should be there spiritual practice this is called sadhana that's why martial devi in a very simple way so many times we say that i always try to remember that by saying my mother said what is sadhana somehow to keep the mind at the feet of god somehow whenever i am helping a poor i am thinking in this person who has come to me for help god is there god wants my service and this world with all these things that i see it's nothing it's temporary i cannot take it back i cannot take it anywhere so why not then help a person who is there let's say from compassion but from devotion god has come to me in that form he wants some help as if if the rich people are not helping the poor people are the poor people going to die they may die but again they will born that is a system will go on it doesn't need anything but those who are really intelligent will think how the wealth has come to me and what is this wealth actually is nothing but getting some comfort and if there is no one around if i am sitting in a desert with lot of food and wealth and gold then what i am going to do with those things i need the company i need people i need society this is a peculiar system it goes on moving so we have to understand the spirituality doesn't mean that i have to go in a secluded place i should not talk to anyone there's only the beginning by understanding why every week we are reading from the panchama veda there is a book of knowledge the gospel of krishna to understand this simple thing god is permanent and the world is temporary we are in the world and if we go for the world for a temporary time we'll enjoy but the time will come when there'll be no one around us and all the wealth and all the name and all the fame and all the certificates and all the the papers in the bank everything will remain so why not keep the mind on something else which is permanent and that is god how long must a man continue the sadhana as long as he has not developed love for the lotus feet of god as long as he has not developed the love not the a-l-o-v-e only four letters but this is a great word the love what is that love is a continuous attachment with someone something that those who love the barred watchers i saw one gentleman he will go in the early morning even the birds are now sleeping that time but he will go with his camera and and sitting in one place continuously without movement when the birds are coming he is taking the photograph watching them continuously love if you ask me to do that may maybe for a minute or so just to satisfy the other query what is this what do they do so that much but this man goes on doing it every time recording then photography is taking and then analyzing whether that type of species are there or not love and in many many subjects this is the love and spirituality love love for god why it is so difficult because we have not seen god the man who is watching the bird he has seen the bird a man who is watching the animals he has seen the animals the man who is doing something a research in the laboratory he is having something to do with but a man who is searching god what he is having nothing but faith nothing but faith and that is why this is very important suramar krishna said if you develop faith then everything has been achieved the faith on what on the instructions of the scripture and what the scriptures are the record of the realizations of the realized people so this is the way we have to understand and that is why this panchama way the gospel of krishna is in scripture and the realization of whom is telling the when the fruit grows the flower drops up he's giving an example when one has developed love of god and has behaved him then one gives up the sandhya and other rights that is the way we always go the if you result has come already then we don't need anything else at a time in the students they study so much because they have to achieve something they have to in the the coming exam they have to see they have to write the exam to get the spouse and then the certificate and when they get the certificate they don't read in that way the before exam as they were they were doing they won't it's not necessary the same way in the sadhana with sadhana you have to restrain your senses control your mind practice the truth and not hurting anyone but anyway all this the people who have already gone the gurus they are giving us back those teachings and those who are now practicing they know that result is going to be as the ramakrishna realized god as buddha realized the self as jesus realized the god same way it will go same way some people may say oh this is blasphemy jesus is god himself ramakrishna is god himself okay the of course they are god no doubt about it but when they came in the human form they are the great teachers and the human form they were born in a very humble families and they were not attending any universities or colleges they grew the knowledge within themselves and then slowly they proved through their life that god is there that is the most important thing so this is the way we should also can follow and sudama krishna said when you achieve the fruit then you need not to practice but before that you should you cannot achieve anything by moving in such a slow space slow pace when you are moving slowly slowly it will of course you can reach but it will take long long time maybe that one may feel oh that is a long so many days i am practicing forget about it let me try something else mostly it happens to those who are trying so the people will go and few days they will practice vaishnavism they will sing the kirtan they will dance they will have the marks and then after a fake few years they'll say oh this is not satisfying the same kirtan all the day again they will go to somewhere else but let us go to the buddhism after practicing psalm with this meditation these that oh that is nothing is happening let us go to vedanta so by that way they are going on tasting only but not digging why anywhere any path you take it sincerely with only two thing in mind god is there the eternal all-powerful all-knowing it is there and this path is a valid path because buddha he followed this path because caitanya mahaprabhu followed this path because jesus christ followed this by because sudama krishna vivekananda they followed this path so this is the way i am choosing this is because according to my temperament i will follow this that cerama question is telling but follow when you are doing it do it sincerely and with great attention and if your mind going everywhere you won't be able to practice this way and the ramakrishna mission those who are brahmacari is there the novices their training is very hard usually they don't allow them to go on reading the newspapers and seeing the movies and these and that nothing on pointed you have to read the holy scriptures you have to work hard because the young body they have to give up their energy for something to the services and then they should become humble so they are serving the seniors cooking the food all the visitors they're dressing the vegetables and also serving the elderly swamis all those things they will do to make themselves practice the humbleness then the time will come when their mind is becoming pure because they are detached from the worldly things slowly slowly mind will go only in one point god purity spirituality love so their mind becomes pure and one pointed they realize god and what is that god the love and unselfishness this unselfishness and love these two qualities that grow and when it comes then you feel the whole world whoever may be there you're friendly your own you like to love them serve them feel for them god realization doesn't mean all the time you have to see the form of god or goddess the quality surama krishna is telling that you have to then he is telling you ask me why you don't feel stern renunciation renunciation what i have to give up tiaga and yoga the tiago is giving up yoga is getting back what you are getting back the joy the love the god and what you are giving up the creation there is also all those things are there but camouflaged in reality there is no love in there it is there is no permanency but camouflaged in such a way in the world oh this is the love i should have these than that and then when i hold that thinking that this is going to give me joy one day i find that it has slipped from my hand so many experiences people are having life after life we are experiencing and then forgetting again we are going and trying to hold that that is the problem so you need a guru who will constantly go on telling you don't touch that don't hold that don't anchor for that turn back turn back is the great guru he is teaching these again and again you are asking me why don't you feel stunned renunciation there is a reason for it suramar krishna giving the answer you have desires and tendencies within you renunciation giving up will come when there is no desire when there is a desire you cannot renounce that renunciation will not be the real renunciation without caring for anything am i going to get food next day i don't know the one swami this is a beautiful the one brahmacharyani she has written an article comparing the characters in of the upanishad and the present-day life vivekananda's disciple he came under the great person he came to swami vivekananda with a request that i like to become a monk you know what swamiji said he said you are going to accept me as your guru right yes sir then whatever i will say and i will think that this is right for you will you accept that yes sir if i think that i should sell you sell you in the tea garden in those days in the bonded labors if i sell you in the tea garden because if i think that that will be good for you are you ready to accept that yes sir like that swamiji another in another place he said if i think that it will be good for you and ask you to jump from that tree the long tree palm tree are you ready to do that without any hesitation yes sir so that is the way having faith in the words of the guru that this is going to give me my ultimate thing it's not going to deceive me but one should be careful about those people their character unless and until we can understand the spirituality means only two things again and again i say i felt it that is love and pure love and love without any boundary without any boundary or this is my country i love this is my own people i love this is my own thing i love no not like that each and everyone and no selfishness i am doing it calculating that i will get some benefit out of it no nothing like that so that person you can accept without hesitation as your guru as your master as your preceptor and then listen to him so sirama krishna is telling the great master that this is the reason because desires and tendencies are there do you know what is it like it is like the needle of a balance on a count of the weight of lost and gold the two needles are not in line the beautifully he always gives this example when he will give one line advice immediately will give an example to make it completely clear what it meant that in the balances there are two needles and the if the the balance are not equal the needles will never be equal because the last and gold is there so obviously the needles are not getting the one the last and goal that means desire desire to enjoy this world it may be kernel desire it may be the name and fame it may be many other ways but ultimately it goes to these two that's that's why ramakrishna again and again mentioned in this way even no doubt in the world now the beautiful words of a guru you are no doubt in the world what if you are you must surrender the fruit of your action to god you must not seek any result for yourself but mark one thing the desire for bhakti cannot be called a desire you must surrender the fruit of your action to god karma nevadas any indian saint will quote in this way from the bhagavad-gita shri krishna is telling to arjuna he is urging arjuna to fight fight for the just cause and then he is telling you just do your duty and then don't wait for the result hanker for the result so this is the way this is the teaching suramar is also telling the same thing why we are in the world we have to perform something sometimes as a teacher sometimes as officer sometimes as a father sometimes as a son sometimes so many duties and responsibilities are there we have to perform those things but the technique is i'm not going to be bound by those how don't wait for the result to come perform it wash your hand that's all good good bad bad whatever comes it's up to god he will understand but if you are doing essentially it will always be successful and always be good so that is the way this is the training then when you are doing it to do and then forget about it this is not only for the monks you know ramakrishna mission monks their sadhana their austerity is very very great why because now of course in different organizations they are having many other things previously it was the among the hindu monks it is only ramakrishna mission those who were having institutions a big hospital a college and then the schools and so many other places now the insur swami is a monk and an administrator and for the administration you have to say whatever i say you must do i say and you do there's a monk has to say and that is the authority otherwise the organization won't run there are offices are there so many people are there you have to impose that this is the thing you must do otherwise i am going to give you punishment administrative job a monk is performing at the same time being a mom he is constantly going on praying to god not me not me not me it is thou thou and suppose the call come from the organization you leave the job and go to some other place he should not feel a pinch for that immediate yes whatever best i could do for that particular place and organization that was responsible just given to me i have tried my best maybe my next person will come and do it much better let him do it all my prayer and blessings for him maybe my previous person couldn't do it's okay for that is god's will that he couldn't i will try in my own way and whatever the success come up to god offered to god this is the training it's not only in the pages of the book you have to have in the life also so this is the way one can become detached with the world what is the detachment what is renunciation salama krishna he went to the root of it we talk about renunciation and sadam krishna said ami the i that is the problem the ego is the problem an ego attached with this body and mind and what is that ego this body is not only there after a few days the mind all naturally won't be there then what is this ego for when we are judging then it becomes very clear and the person in a spiritual life these are the very important things ego should not be there but self-confidence should be there always every time if the self-confidence is not there you won't be able to do anything including the meditation and japanese tremendous self-confidence i am going to sit and meditate and i am going to see my god within my heart this i this confidence exactly in the in the line of the lord buddha i'm going to sit on this particular seat and maybe that all my body will perish but i won't get up from here till i get the realization of the supreme truth with that buddha side i am going to sit on the seat to that confidence so we have to understand it is not ego it is but self-confidence so we have to give up then you say no doubt that you are in the world you must surrender the fruit of your action to god you must not seek any result for yourself but mark one thing that immediately is telling there's always the the question comes asking for devotion asking for mukti is also a desire now giving the surama krishna is giving the reply to that the desire for bhakti devotion cannot be called a desire asking for liberation mukti cannot be called as desire you may desire bhakti and pray for it practice the tamasa bhakti now he is urging his teaching these three qualities are there and the tama means that i want it and now i want use that for devotion so he is telling practice the tamasa bhakti and force your demand upon the divine mother now comes this today we are supposed to talk about the god is your mother and it is saying by saying this you have to practice the tama tama means that type of quality that i should get it why not and always eager to force on that so that is good go and pray to mother you are my mother you have given me birth and now i demand this thing you must have to give as sram krishna himself did we went to the kali temple and he said you have given darshan to ram prasad to kamala kanta they were also the worshipers of goddess kali before him so why you should not give your darshan manifest before me why so what you need i i'll be ready to practice that but you have to give your darshan there's four things over there god is your own mother enforce your demand if you are part of a thing you feel its attraction a part of a thing the god has created me so obviously i'm also god if the god has created me i am also the part and parcel of god all those qualities are there within me the divine mother has created me so i have every right to demand that you have created me you are my mother you have to come before me stand before me listen to my prayer and help me to achieve my goal you can demand that is called tamasik bhakti bhakti means devotion and tamasika means forceful you have to give me the me is there very strongly but at the same time god krishna said this me is not going to bind you hey i am doing this i am doing that that will bind you that is ego but when i am going to die mother you must come before me this me is not going to bind you because it is for the god and you don't want the any other thing the surama krishna is telling the god is your own mother friends we all know that in the bhakti-sutra there are five different they have a traditional way traditionally they have mentioned and they urge that suramar krishna also said in many places you should develop a relation with god in the devotion the god is there i am here so you should have a relation with god only simply god is there i am here no it won't work that way but if you develop a relation according to your temperament so naturally all your emotions all your thinking you can force on that line it says in this way the god is the doer he is doing everything i have nothing to say and nothing to do that is called peacefully there'll be always so many things are happening all around and that person who has a relation with god as a santa barbara he said no god is the doer and suppose he is killing now the thousands of people must be there is a reason i'm not going to doubt about it i'm not going to ask any question nothing i am at peace that is a completely separated from the things that is happening all around in the world that is called santa barbara the rishis of the old they used to have this just to practice in this way their mind is completely detached from all around things that is happening they are all in peace next come the darshan the god is the master i have to serve him there are many people they like to work in the temple they'll be going and bathing that god and then washing him and putting and they love it so much everything they will do they are ready to do for the god and that is a devotion this is not the narrow thing no we should not make that mistake there are some people in the name of religion thinking that we are doing the god's work and going and killing themselves and along with them also killing some innocent people no i am not talking about that he had the service to god the god is the master he is the supreme i should go and wash his feet and then i will wait for his command whatever he asks whatever he says i should follow that there's a different thing and example is the dossier another is sakya sakhya is the friend he's not afraid of god rather friendly he goes and talk to god consult with god and he'll be eating and also the same thing he will offer to god can you imagine when your mind is completely pure and you can feel that you can eat and also share the same thing to god that is called the friendly the relation with god constantly and you feel constant pain if your the best friend is not with you you like to share everything with your best friend and when you were young the the best other friends are there best friend now also that some children will be there this is my best friend and all our friends that means the relation with that because the one person who can understand me and i can also understand him best friend so understanding that way that god is my best friend i can share everything with god oh no how can i talk to god in this way how can i look at god in this way no friend can do it and then it goes to baath saliyah that is a god is my child i have to look after the god otherwise what god will do he's a child he doesn't understand anything so this is the way you know that uh we four swamis we were going to in the in india there are four places and very important places and one is called jamun o3 from the the source of the jabuna and we went over there very hard walking and very difficult on the top of that mountain and when we came down exhausted we wanted to eat something so there was a person who was having a oven so one of our swamis went over there and requested can you please cook in this fashion something for us a little rise and land trails and all that and he was preparing a few ladies from the they were also traveling with us in the same bus they were from rajasthan a place in india very devoted people and very orthodox hindu and they were observing from distance and when they observed the cook is not properly cooking the ladies they came and they started rebuking the cook hey you should not do this you should not use these ingredients they are monks but the cook told but the swami asked me to do like this they are like children they don't understand so i heard that they are like children the god is my child god is that it doesn't understand anything so and that god likes to play like the child i have to go and sing and then i have to making sleep and they should be very soft the bait should be soft pillow should be very soft and it should be properly covered so that is the way they handle so that is called bhatsalya the sometimes the mothers particularly they like it very much to thank god as their child we know that they're famous our those who are in the tradition of ramakrishna you have heard the name of that the agar mani devi gopal's mother and people used to call as gopal's mother kupal means the god krishna when his child agar mani devi he was having this madhura bhava the classical example that is our radha and krishna god is my husband another in the historical character we find that another lady she was a great singer meera bhai she is also from rajasthan so she loved that god the krishna and from his child from her childhood days she started thinking krishna is my god my husband so they developed that now here the sudama krishna is introducing another relationship with god five were there the sixth one god is my mother that is a unique idea that i am not going to do anything because i am the child i don't know anything which is good and bad for me but my mother knows so obviously this attitude is the most holy attitude very pure attitude a very simple attitude only two things are necessary what is that the faith in the existence of god and whom i consider as my mother faith hundred percent faith the god is there my mother and she will take care of me this is the fasting complete faith and then sincerely praying to the mother as a baby as a child when the babies are hungry they can't talk what they do they go on crying the mother will come and they understand whether the baby is hungry or the baby needs some other attention they understand the baby is only one thing crying not expressing anything not telling anything but the mothers will understand mothers will help you have to change my dress or you have to take me somewhere else and the baby will go on crying the mother they understand what they need i have to cry i have to pray that's all nothing else so faith that god is there and there she is my mother the srama krishna is not telling father of course in the eastern religion the consideration of the godhead as mother that is very popular so mother and who is a mother full of love one who is full of love fast and that loves knows no barter as swami vivekananda said that no the carrying the baby taking the baby on the lap whole night baby may be crying something has happened the mother will spend the whole night awake to take care of the baby can you imagine the love even the nurses won't do the paid people won't do but this great love the mother will do maybe the mother is not rich maybe the mother is not educated the maybe the mother is not in comfort but the any mother has that great love and concern for her baby great affection i have noticed the newly born baby if you look notice the mothers they don't like to see anything else all the time they'll be looking at the face of that baby they like to observe that when the baby just is smiling then the mother will be so happy my baby is smiling the baby is looking the baby is yawning baby the mother's whole world goes to that baby so much of affection and that is mother just giving the birth and then leave that baby they are not mothers that begeting children are giving the capacity to give the birth of children that is not mother mothers are the qualities the quality first is the love the one way love not expecting anything return then affection they forget all other around constantly looking at the baby and enjoying great sympathy sometimes they're sick sometimes not physically challenged but the mother sympathy tremendous they will never give up constantly they will go on helping i have seen those great mothers going on helping their their children and they're proud of it not feeling shy and they'll be telling to introducing all other people she is my son and in the in the in a wheelchair this that boy sitting mother is pushing but with great joy there's a sympathy concern forgiveness whatever the child is doing mother will always forgive then the last blessings and prayer the mother when they go to pray to the temple to the churches they pray only for the children they forget about themselves oh god i am suffering please take care of me neighbor my child should be healthy my child should be successful my child should do this my child should do that and that is mother their blessings and their prayer constantly that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna said you have a mother god is your own mother is she a stepmother see why is telling like the maybe state mother is sometimes the stepmother may not like not that all the time stepmother means if the villian not like that stepmother also loves is it an artificial relationship no you can force your mother you can demand on heart then and whom can you force if the we are not forcing or sometimes some devotee they say shall i pray for my son's success to because it's a worldly thing as a mother to whom shall we go you go to god only no sometimes people they ask can we pray takur of course said the purest of the pure prayer is devotion discrimination that but when do up to that i have not reached what i can do at least i can say mother i don't have anyone else except you so i am praying to you so this here is a great faith when you are reading this gospel of sirama krishna what we are learning we are learning that god is there and in the form of a mother and who is always ready to help us who is always ready to forgive us but that is the great source and when we are in despair when we do not know what i should do what if the things are going to happen there is a mother just pray to mother and how go and demand that is what salaam krishna is teaching remember these o mind nobody is your own krishna is singing most of the time he is to elaborate his teaching through songs and then anecdotes and here is a beautiful song he's singing remember these o mind nobody is your own being is your wandering in this world trapped in the subtle snare of maya as you are do not forget the mother's name do not forget the mother's name the mother means whatever the name the guru has given us the god is our mother maybe it may be shiva it may be the visnu it may be anything but we will consider that god as a mother and the affectionate mother you have to pray pray and pray spend a few days thinking of god asking the devotees spend a few days thinking of god sometimes some people they like to go to ganges for a change they will go they will roam around and they will take photo and all that and then they'll come back it is okay no problem but those who go over there the ganges and our retreat center vivekananda retreat center and if there's a shrine if you can spend an hour over there and then sit under a tree and sing a bhajan then look at the sky all alone and thinking is there god can god see me can i see god fancy but still your mind will go and play on god but you have to be alone or with some people those who will cooperate with your temperament otherwise if they like to just make fun it may not be you cannot practice this thing but sudama krishna is telling spend a few days thinking of god just thinking of god so this is the beautiful way the surama krishna is teaching and continuing the master said what are these things you busy yourself with he is talking with that our devotee ishan ishan was an arbitrator that some property some problem different people used to come to him he knew the law he will sit with them help them that was it as because ishan was growing old salama krishna saw the goodness in him so he was trying to enough is enough you have a lot of money now you need not to spend your money days in that to earn money forget about all those things give up that is that is the best guru guru will never see anything else but the development of the spirituality in a devotee so that is the reasons ramakrishna is asking give up all those things arbitration and leadership i hear that you settle people's calls surround krishna is to give i the all information about the devotees let those who care for such things do them now devote your mind more and more to the lotus feet of god the saying goes but then he is telling that unnecessarily don't waste your time that is the teaching we do so many things thinking that if i am not doing who else will do is this world depending on me this was before it will be continuing without me also so what should i do the human birth is very precious and time is very short we do not know what is going to happen and when that is the reason when you are going to bed remember god and when you are sleeping think that you are lying on the lap of the mother then we get up the first thing that we should open our eyes and see is the great photo of the god the picture of the god nowadays is a photo that was taken of bhagavan sirama krishna so the mother said looking at that picture is as good as seeing god looking to that particular picture the morning the first thing i should see god pray to god another new day has come so many challenges before me but oh god do not give up do not let my hand go off from you hold my hand that's why this is the prayer hold my hand and lead me to the goal sunama krishna is teaching that kishopsin asked me why do i need why do i not see god suramar krishna is telling that giving the example of the kesha keshav was a great person in those days and kesha was a leader of a spiritual group brahma samaj so that kesha asks ramakrishna why do i not see god i said you do not see god because you busy yourself with such things as name and fame and scholarship it's very clear soon krishna was not hesitant at all to reply to kesha and he said though you are doing all these things in the name of religion but in the subtle mind it is there the name fame and leadership so scholarship so this is the reason most of the people they're bound by that this is a very subtle way of binding there are so many things are there that binds a spiritual asparant but the last is fame the people should appreciate me that is the last the huddle that a spiritual person should overcome so he was teaching kesha the mother does not come to the child as long as it shucks its toy but when when it throws the toy away and cries then the mother ticks down the right spot from the hearth and comes running to the child suramar krishna depicting in the village the mothers are cooking and still now in the indian villages there will be the handmade oven are there and the rice is boiling the rice eater so they're preparing their eyes when the child is crying the mother will know that this is the time i must go and take care of my child she will take down that cooking part and run that is the mother let the god become our mother let that be our prayer i think there are some questions please tell about ramallah now this is the ram lala some other day we may talk that is a different so completely and that is there in the great master please read that particular portion that's a beautifully depicted the relationship between the god and the devotee ram lala is a child and sirama krishna devotee taking care of the god as a child that all details are there so this is not the time to discuss but thank you for the beautiful question the second question is if god is our mother then why there is so much sorrow suffering all over the world no mother in this world wants her child suffering how can we overcome from it and the beautiful very good question the suffering that we see that sometimes we think that that is the punishment that the mother is giving you know that one thing we have to keep in mind that the karmapala the past karma that we have done we have to follow that mashardamani devi holy mother she also said this the same question was asked to ah then the she replied but your past karma and you were supposed to be imputed one leg that was so bad but if you are praying to god with open heart accepting her the god as your mother then the mother will protect you maybe you will have a prick of a needle instead of imputing the whole leg sir you know the different karma fellas things are happening all around so many things are happening and we are thoroughly confused don't disturb the mind with all these i know that obviously the emotion is there but at the same time as if you are a thorough spiritual transparent concentrate your mind on the teachings of bhagavan siram krishna pray to mother pray to mother to please remove all these sufferings all people are crying pray too hard and leave it to heart only same question from second question he's saying maharaja as a krihi can we experience god and if yes then how oh this is the exactly what's ramakrishna said we read it that milan babu i think if you once again go to youtube and then listen to this talk i was reading here you are no doubt in the world what if you are you must surrender the fruit of your action to god the greeks can realize god or how by surrendering the action at the feet of the god it is there if you listen if you read and the page number is 612 the english gospel people would appreciate me maharaj please tell us how does the idea will get rid of our mind people will appreciate me so this is the idea how i can go beyond that no no you need not to the in the beginning that is the the force why should i do that the children what they do if they are drawing something the elderly people they say oh so so nice drawing and they get encouragement so in the beginning when you are taking the first step in spirituality even if that thought is there let it be there then slowly slowly go on giving those things at the feet of god suppose you have done something or planning to do something go and consult consult with the god mother so i am trying to planning to do this see that i am successful see the people appreciate me no problem and then slowly slowly will grow into spirituality and then he will say mother whatever the success has come i give it to you but please you mother god should not leave me so this is the growth in the spiritual world is asking why can't i take an important decision what to do the taking the important decision means you have to go and pray to god with tears so this is the problem before me and please tell me that how can i take the decision many of the times if you are doing it with faith you will find if thought will come within your mind you better do this and that is the decision and second is whatever decision you are going to take see that it is not going to harm anyone god's blessings will be with you thank you thank you for the good questions let us now offer our pranam to takuran conclude this
