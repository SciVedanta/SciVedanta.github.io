[287. Panchama Veda 297 - “Sri Ramakrishna’s Attitude.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4PAIsVcaH0)

namaskar dear devotees and friends today the panchama veda that we'll be studying the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna let us begin the devotees and friends you know that last wednesday we didn't had this class because the society vedanta society of chicago observed the kali puja in the words of bhagavan sirama krishna this kali about he is mentioning whom you call brahman i call kali it's a great sentence great word that he said whom you call brahman i call kali you know the in in hinduism this is the brahman that is the ultimate all-pervading consciousness and on the basis of that everything the whole hindu religion the edifice of hindu religion is standing on this concept oneness one which has pervaded all pervasive all-powerful all-merciful and different words that they used but it is only one now because it is one and it is all pervading everywhere so obviously it cannot have any any image but hindus are having thousand and one images so many gods and goddesses kali is one of them a time came in india then some people a so-called educated people they started criticizing this particular image the goddess kali because the image and in hinduism this is the unique way the beautiful concept very subtle concept spiritual concept only for the ordinary people they have given some the form goddess kali is one of that but people couldn't understand and the tremendous you know against the anti-propaganda oh my god how could you worship a lady who is not having any clothes and cutting the heads of others and like that like that they used to say many of us they used to believe also some of the stories will be there it is nothing like that because the concept is completely different that nature which is all pervading which is the power of the supreme god which is creating constantly and naturally there is nothing bigger than that nature and how can you cover it second as because it is creating constantly so we have given the figure as a mother mother figure and this nature is giving the best gift to the human society the human that is his intellect the head is the symbol of the intellect she has not cut the head of anyone that is only story to attract the ordinary minds so this way if we can understand so there is the consciousness which is not having any action which is inactive but full of knowledge that is the shiva and the same brahman when it is active it is kali so that bhagavan sirama krishna the in 1836 the god himself he took the human form 1835 that they were planning to completely eradicate the completely uh distort the culture and the religion of the indian society but hindu society and that was the planning of the mikhail lord mikhail and 19 1835 he was planning 1836 the god came in the form of bhagavan sirama krishna and he re-established dharmasthapana in the meantime a group of people they started they were confused they were not having that spiritual practices uh the habit of their tapasya so couldn't get so only intellectually they were trying to understand and they were having different type of ways to go beyond this the onslaught of uh the other religion the other culture it is bhagavan si rama krishna who came and who worshipped the lord a goddess kali the mother and the lord shiva and established that this is the bodha are the same and then he said that brahman all pervading consciousness is the same as kali so when we worship the goddess kali we worship on that particular concept that it is that lord god bhagavan si ramakrishna himself who is that embodiment of the consciousness in the human form and active also the to establish the dharma so this is the way we worship kali and of course the traditional the mantras and the yagyas and all other things we perform the kali puja was done and now this our we will now own life as an example bhagavan sirama krishna insisted the devotee to realize god first then talk about him that is his attitude he give the ex his own the example he never talked about god he never gave any lecture he never wrote any book be only he practiced and how he practiced that is the example that all the spiritual uh the the mumukshus the people who like to get the liberation they should follow the life of bhagavan sirama krishna now friends let us begin from here as we we know that the conversation was going on with the devotees in kolkata and bhagavan sirama is mentioning in this way so the conversation turned to narendra a devotee why doesn't he come to you so frequently nowadays the devotee is asking raghavan sirama krishna the pointing that this narendra is not coming nowadays master quoting a proverb then when there is no money when there is a problem [Music] in the economical problem even the kali dasha the great poet the great thinker the he gets confused and sadama krishna himself said khali pete you cannot practice religion in an empty stomach so this is always in india they always understood this and that is why they balanced the both the things they were properly balanced and one was the spiritual growth along with that the materialistic growth it was balanced obudaya and nistreya in two sanskrit words it was used and one of the philosophies of the six philosophy they say that is the definition of the dharma the religion where the advices are given for the development of the both buddha that means the worldly prosperity and nystra usher the spiritual development both should go hand in hand so when you are hungry when the society is poor whether you are having a great philosophy nobody is going to care about it so that's why the india from the beginning itself they were balancing it and because of the social and the historical things it got changed now again once again it is coming back is mentioning about the narendra because his father passed away and his relatives they were also as usual in the normal the society life you find there is any opportunity to grab the others money even the relatives so close the they become enemies so same thing happened in their life too they were in great difficulty so narendra was trying to find out a job sirama krishna is mentioning that narendra frequently visits his friend ananda guha of the family of shiva guwaha balarama he is telling balaram bush the this one thing the narendra is a very important personality though he was hardly 17 or 18 years old sudama krishna used to like him love him very much the devotees also used to like him now that he is not coming all are concerned what happened to him now naturally different informations are coming the yeah the balarama is mentioning he frequently visits his friend ananda guha master yes i have heard that too narendra and his friends meet the meet at the house of a government officer and conduct meetings of the brahma-samaj there the brahma-samaj as most of you know in at that time it was very very popular among the educated people and this the same thing they told that the god cannot have the forms because god is all pervasive so they could not understand the why the god is having so many images if the god is all powerful why not as is the god is all-powerful can he not enter into an image that is the argument and moreover as swami vivekananda afterwards this narendra who became vivek and then afterwards he given a wonderful example to a king who was asking this question how can a god entered into a doll into a doll it's in so an image stone image it is not the image that you worship it is not the stone that you worship we through that we try to reach to that ultimate reality that was the answer the narendra gave the swami vivekananda to hear his narendra is meeting over there a devotee the officer's name is tarapada see when we are listen reading this page as if just normal we also sometimes when we meet together and then we some some person who used to come nowadays is not coming so obviously there will be people will be asking about him whatever the information about that person we know they'll be exchanging the same thing is happening over here is the officer's name is tarapada the balarama smiling the brahmins say that ananda guha is a very egoistic man balaram babu is a very good person and is a very good devotee this is all we know this balaram babu was concerned that narendra the young boy is going to their house and about that particular person whose house narendra is visiting it's not having a good name sometimes some people are criticizing saying that a egoistic person but now listen to the reply of bhagavan si ramakrishna never listen to what the brahm means say brahm means means some of the maybe priest of the temple the time you know their nature very well if a man doesn't give them money they will call him bad on the other hand if a man is generous to them they will call him good so all are laughing so the brahmins means that is the characteristics and how nicely is ramakrishna uh he is mentioning so if when some some people are giving some comments on others this is the way we have to understand and take that particular comment who is the person talking how is he his character so does it always say the truth that is the thing most of the time we are carried away someone is not himself is not a good person maybe having some the the wrong ideas the the get the opportunity and immediately criticize someone and we get that impression and carried away with that idea that is very wrong what is charitra the character these balarama is so close to bhagavan si rama krishna that balarama when he said something sudama krishna didn't rebuke him or scold him but immediately told the how one should accept this type of comments otherwise we make great mistake so we learn so many things the spiritual life means everything should be rectified corrected and properly utilized otherwise just going to temple and sitting before that for closing their eyes and then offering these and that and i am a holy person i am a religious man it is nothing like that each and every thought that is crossing our mind one should be very very careful so that is the importance of this the gospel of sirama krishna the sirama krishna he is mentioning here in this way that don't get particularly give much importance to those people's comments because they are not themselves a man made up characters the drawing room was full of devotees the master wanted to hear some songs at his request tarapada sang about krishna is a famous song o keshabha best to the grace upon the luckless servant here dina dina means the very poor spiritually poor kunja kanan hadi the delight in the brindavana there's a kunja gunja means as a grove there may be fruit trees and the flower trees like that so keshav that is the the bengali song okay is too thy grace upon thy servants here and after the song the two songs he sang then the master to girish ah it is beautiful song did you write it girish chandra ghosh he composed some songs and particularly he composed for his own dramas he used to present the dramas to and he used to compose the songs a devotee yes said he wrote all the songs for his play the caitanya leela then suramar krishna this one has really hit the mark that means it came from the heart that's why bhagavan sirama krishna is appreciating so much then the person who is singing is a different person is a tara prada but the song that he is singing it was composed by the girish chandra ghost seerah at sirama krishna's request tarapada sang two more songs in the first nitai exhorts people to share radha's love for sri krishna come one and all take radha's love the high tide of our love flows by so this is the way he is mentioning the the radha is mentioned as a kishari kishari is a radha rather's love is the purest love for god so that that is the reason bhagavan's rama krishna is always is to appreciate that there was no other thing in the mind but the love for god the love for love's sake so that was the purest of the pure attraction attachment for god so that is called radha's love this is those who are following the path of devotion the the most of them the vishnubbers they're particularly gory the bush nevers they are inspired by this devotion of sri radha next he sang about gauranga koranga means caitanya mahaprabhu who are thou gore of the golden hue his complex was the almost like the gold he was very fear complex person the gauranga caitanya mahaprabhu so they were named the devotees pressed aim to sing him means master mashay now master moshe was a very shy person though he was a highly educated person very knowledgeable person intelligent person and we can imagine the whatever the conversation the people used to have so many people and and so many different ways they're speaking all he could remember they say that they used to note down how can he note it down because different people different comments and immediately maybe that he used to write in a almost like a shorthand he used to mention one or two things and sometimes he used to write on his white cloth that used to wear over there so the people won't notice it and then when he used to go back he used to meditate the whole thing again and write it down he was sitting in this corner and that was the ganges was flowing in this this side this way and the wind was blowing it was this was the time sirama krishna stood up suramar krishna sat down says each and every details the photographic memory photogenic memory so that is the way it was so but now that he was very shy type so when the people in the lake pooling time that the master master should sing he was a headmaster and some of the his students they were sitting before over there the devotees praised aim to sing aim was shy and asked them in a whisper to excuse him that he was afraid the sudama krishna will force him like sing then what he will do say he was whispering no no please forgive me i won't be girish to the master girish was the you know that sometimes the bullying so he is saying to the master sir we cannot find a way to persuade aim to sing master and apparently showing the annoyance yes he can barely state at school that he will be showing his teeth at the school classroom because he's talking over there giving the classes but shyness overpowers him when he asks to sing but notice here suramar krishna knew his character he salam krishna knew he won't be able to sing there because he feel shy so he never asked the master why don't you sing as because all people are asking he didn't say that master masha himself is writing feeling greatly distressed remained speechless master mashay naturally people are saying like that suramar krishna said in that way he that also he has mentioned this is the beauty that he was unable to sing over there and for that he got the scolding from the master he that also he has noted it down he didn't he could simply uh not mention that and we no one could know it he mentioned that that is the genuineness of this book suresh mitra a beloved householder disciple of master was seated at a distance the master cast an affectionate glance at him and say to him and look at it salaam krishna knew him very well suresh metra in those days it was almost the normal for all the educated and rich people and shurish mitra was not only rich but also very influential government officer so obviously drinking wine and these that so many things they stood to now slowly slowly they started coming visiting sirama krishna and because of his holy company they all got transformed the masama krishna when he noticed that both they are sitting girish and suresh the sudama krishna is saying to him master cast an affectionate glance at him and said to him pointing to girish you talk of having lived a wild life but here is one who you could not surpass that means the girish chandra goes and we all know girish the girish was that and he never tried to hide that sudan krishna loved those who were not hypocrites well i am having this type of attitude and feeling what to do with that i am coming to you god please help me surama krishna was very happy and not only that he completely transformed them this is the beauty of bhagavan sirama one time when he came in the form of sri rama he had to take up the arms to fight as a krishna he had to do a lot of planning and himself sometimes killed but as a ramakrishna the same god in the form of sri ramakrishna time changed society changed people changed now you need not to kill the people but to change their attitude change their mind change their thought process and the man is changed exactly that what suramar krishna is doing this girish chandra ghosh or suresh babu they were different type of people coming in contact with the holy person like sirama krishna slowly slowly they gave up all the bad habits and became a wonderful missionary they themselves not only practice that truthfulness the holiness the love the service attitude concern for others and these to go and mix with the society and spread that message that is the unique missionary work then his ramakrishna making fun you talk of having lived a wild life but here is one you could not subverse then the suresh is with a smile if we just close our eyes and you know in bengali it's called atta means having the nice time gossiping and talking and leg pulling among the friends and the lord god bhagavan sirama krishna he's having that the unique way and the suresh with a smile yes sir he is my elder brother in that respect that that means the girish gosh the girish to the master well sir i didn't have i didn't have any education during my boyhood but still people say i'm a learned man krishna muhima charan has studied many scripture a big man to aim to master moshe isn't that so mahi macharan we know those who are following this class those who have read the gospel of sirama krishna the mahima is a very frequent visitor to ramakrishna and he not only read the scripture he memorized so many verses the slokas but did you notice only memorizing the slokas and the verses and quoting them and bhagavan sidha krishna is not very happy with that now what is there just quoting so sirama krishna he mentioned that the mahima is a very learned person isn't he when the girish gosh mentioned that why people are thinking that i am an educated person did you notice that sirama krishna is not commenting at all about that the it is the girish the who in those days that was almost the way people used to learn and rich people and and that their children they never attended the schools by that way but mostly they got educated in their own home and girish was very intelligent he self-taught not that he never attended the school but not going to the universities or the colleges like that but srila krishna didn't pay any heed just listen to that and immediately asking raising this point particularly about the mohimacharan master masha the aim yes sir girish what book learning i have seen enough of it it cannot fool me anymore so this is girish very straight forward srama krishna with a smile do you know my attitude today i have given the topic sadama krishna's attitude friend we must be careful about this ramakrishna's way of practicing or thinking because we are following bhagavan sirama krishna and how he wants us to be that is important do you know my attitude books scriptures and things like that only point out the way to reach god after finding the way what more need is there are books and scriptures then comes the time of for action so this is very very important kind is coming for action action means we know that there is god and we read different scriptures different books and then quote from there and right from there some people have the the very st the wonderful the power power capacity to express the the language capacity so they have the power on the over that language and they can express and so beautifully people are mesmerized but what is that tata kim tatakim there is a verse is there you say if you your mind is not going to god what is that of that if they're just you are reading and then a quoting and there and saying and putting that just like a drama so this we have to understand sadama krishna wants us to be very very serious to apply and use our time for god realization and that's why he is telling then comes the time for action not that we should not read the scripture we must not that we should not hear about god we must but after that when we know what is the goal and how to reach over there and what are the hindrances now we should try to realize god by practicing those here the keno punished it says ii chapter [Music] means knowing that if you can realize god here and now oh you are lucky the great that is the best way that is the best the process to utilize our human life time is short we do not know what is going to happen when and how so whatever time that we get we must try to keep our mind at the feet of the god some people unnecessarily are going on saying there is no god there is no god how do you know that there is no god so this is and some people they have a habit of saying no anything no i i don't believe i don't believe can you prove that there is no god god that is the consciousness that is everywhere not knowing that just because of this way if we say that is not good moreover when we try to prove that has a few system one is the system is that shabda what is that shabda shabda means those who have already realized the god those who have realized god when they say they talk about god we must have to accept that that is called sabda pramana prataksa anumana upo mana shabda etc there are processes to prove you know i cannot prove that inside uh in the the chemistry lab or physics lab so i don't believe in god god is completely different a inner self how can you prove that can you prove love in the laboratory my my mother loved me and they will go and put the mother in some taste oh he's when she is in this mood she is loving me 95 percent and then it is what that nonsense the love and the all the concerns all this thing we can feel we can understand but we cannot prove before others how can we prove by external behavior we can how it is then when we love each and every one without expecting anything in return and that is called the love how you have generated that love because i believe that my god my beloved god is in every being that is the way so shabda now the great personalities like the buddha like the sri chaitanya like jesus like bhagavan sirama krishna when they are talking like this they are not having any personal agenda nothing whether you criticize them whether you accept them or not they go on telling there is god and look at their life full of joy though they were not having any worldly thing that is the proof so and upanishad we particularly those hindus we always believe in the upanishad the veda upanishads is the main veda and do punish us the same way same argument the rishis they realize that in the pure mind what is the pure mind there is no desire at all in the mind desire for the worldly things that is called pure mind in that mind slowly that manifestation comes that is called the revelation then he says if you can realize here and now in this life then it is great if you cannot then it's a great loss for you because you do not know in next birth how you will you will born whether you will get the opportunity or not because of the subtle desires because of our other certain work that we have done for that maybe we have to suffer we do not know god forbid let each and every one of us we realize god and we go to our prayed places some people they like to go to heaven let them go to heaven but the particularly the the indians the hindus they like to go to they get the mukti not even the heaven heaven is also little place for them they like to go to that liberation the way there is no desire the desire for what the worldly things and what are the worldly things constantly changing i wanted a beautiful thing then i got that and after some time it is all destroyed it is all gone there is no beauty i don't like that at all so these are the direct experiences we are having every time every moment we are having that experiences and naturally we have to decide no it is not the worldly things it must be something which is permanent and that is god in this very life we have to and how that will come and bibek chula muni i'm quoting from vivek ramani that also it says the sixth verse of the biblic ceremony badan to shastrani jajan to devan quoting from the scripture badantu shastrani jajan to devan and worshiping the gods and in the temple they're constantly worshiping the god and putting on that type of vermilion mark and different type of dresses it is okay kurban karmani bhajantu devata you are also karmani karma means the yaga and yagya you are having great young girls every day they will be yakya and some people they like it very much they will be constantly performing the young that it is okay but now the shankaracharya he is telling us the truth that supreme god when that is not becoming united that means when you are not realizing the truth there is no mukti there is no liberation na siddhati brahma satan the hundred years of the lifespan of brahma and the brahma's life and their itself there's a they have given uh that four three two zero zero zero zero zero zero four hundred thirty two hundred thousand that is the one day of the human day of the human year now the brahmas one day 432 hundred thousand years of a human is a one day of brahma and then one night of the same period then comes 24 hours that's called adheena and that way 100 year that is impossible to calculate even so that is a huge use that means infinite that time that is called brahma and if you are not getting united you are not realizing the self with your own self then there is no chance of getting the mukti that it it says like that now brahma shatta antharip shatta means hundred brahma means brahma the creator opi even badantustrani yajantu devan kurubuntukarvani bhajanta devata and the people they have studied the scripture they are so good in narrating the scripture and writing the commentaries on that and when they give the talk people are mesmerized hundreds and thousands of people listening to them that is everything is okay but unless and until you have realized the brahman it is of no use so then in the in the biblical harmony again in the eighth verse it says now therefore obturan with the mumuksu the person who has realized this understood this now strive for liberation let us strive now let us try now to get the liberation liberation from where from desire how we will start the journey for the spiritual liberation it says by giving up all worldly desires sannyasins and nyasa means giving up the sannyastha by her sukha bhaiyasuka internally we are very happy when you are meditating we are seeing my lord inside sitting on the throne of my heart i'm so happy but here it is the external happiness from the objects that we get don't depend on that we have to give up that so we have to try to strive for the liberation spiritual liberation how by giving up the worldly things worldly pleasures then it is giving up but you have to have something positive what is the positive thing santa mahantam she comes by approaching a holy guru just without knowing anything if we go on giving up the worldly things and like a homeless and living on the street that is not the way so that's why the acharya shankaracharya he is mentioning well just giving up the worldly things also on do there's a process what to give so go to a guru the guru who has already crossed that ocean the guru who has already realized that and how he will understand that he is a person of god only two qualities you have to see in him that that person is having only love and unselfishness it's not having any selfish thing the selfish people will always say come to me only don't go over there whatever you have to give give to me only don't give to others like that so they are selfish people they have the some agenda and they don't have the love for that when they see that this person is a rich man and he can donate then they will oh come come every day they will say and when that person is a poor okay you meet me and then we have already made so you needed to come these are not the good gurus the one should be very very careful of that one who is having the pure love and unselfishness so this is the pure guru and if we go to them and under their guidance if we try then concentrate your mind according to his teaching so this is the way we should move the srama krishna is mentioning that do you know my attitude books scriptures and the things like that are in only point out the way to reach god after finding the way what more need is there are books and scriptures then comes the time for action then he is telling and as always he used to give an example so he mentions over here a man received a letter from home informing him that certain person a certain presence were to be sent to his relatives the names of the articles were given in the letter as he was about to go shopping for them he found that the letter was missing he began anxiously to search for it several others joining in the search for a long time they continued to search then at last the later was discovered his joy knew no bounds with great eagerness he opened the letter and read it it said that he was to buy five shades of sweets a piece of cloth a few other things then he did not need the later anymore for it had served his purpose putting it aside he went out to buy the things how long is such a later necessary as long as its contents are not known when the contents are known one proceeds to carry out the directions so bhagavan sirama krishna by this way he is mentioning the scriptures teach us how we should what is our goal and how to reach to that goal that much now sometimes we give so much of importance on those scriptures without even opening and reading that without trying to understand that without following the instructions of the scriptures we go on fighting with others why you have touched my scripture with the left hand or these or that what is this so under that's why in the in the hinduism most of the hindus also many of the hindus also can't understand that it says the even the vedas the what are that in the two different type of guyanas are there parachutes that is only mundane knowledge the there it includes the vedas also rigveda kalpa niruktam it says in that way so that means all the vedas are also giving you only information they were talking about the ultimate truth that is the the self or the atman the brahman but but that is the highest knowledge when you truly realize that is giving emphasis all the time on the realization of the brahman and god this is the beauty of this religion that every time every guru every scripture is constantly going on telling ya you must realize here and now in the scriptures you will find the way to realize god but after getting all the information about the path you must begin to work only then can you attain your goal so how we will know that we are making the progress the more and more unselfishness will come within my heart more and more love for others understanding will generate so i'll be a really a different person the person who was so sensitive even a glance at him means immediately he will be angry why the man looked at me like that that person will be so loving caring helping so that is the change that comes through religion each and every one of us has to examine we cannot go to any person to say can you please test me and say that i have progressed in this spiritual life it's not necessary the one we ourself can understand the whether we are making the progress or not so that is exactly what bhagavatama krishna is mentioning here many a times i as i mentioned that the 12th chapter the from the 13th verse to 19 verse the bhagavan sri krishna the lord he has mentioned whom he likes the god is liking someone who is having these qualities whether he is a brahman where he was born in a higher caste whether he is educated whether nothing like that friends we should understand that so we try to get the attention of the god his blessings we like to go to him but he has already given us that these are the qualities if you are having then only i will like you i will love you i will bless you and in the 16th chapter first three the slokas the verses containing 22 wonderful qualities divine qualities if we can imbibe that and that is religion that is the religion religion doesn't mean only the dogmas and these and that bashami began to say is a transformation being and becoming and how we will transform this body is not going to be permanent whatever the yoga we practice whatever medicine we drink whatever other processes we try it's not going to be permanent and if not then why to waste the time whatever is necessary to maintain the body that is sufficient but we have to turn our mind towards mind that this weekend the saturday and sunday i'll be in minnesota going to give a retreat the purification of mind the mind is very very important and if that mind we understand the dc are the things that we have to follow then the mind gets purified as the we are other processes are there for the external purification but the internal purification mind is a very subtle thing how to purify that that the scriptures are instructing us and then how i will know that i have become purified that examples are also there and then what is the are the processes by which i can reach over there so these all things will be discussed this saturday and sunday mainly saturday the whole day the sunday as i give the classes sunday class will be from there online so this is the mind human mind is very very important if we are thinking about the world we become worldly if we are thinking about god we become divine and what is are those divine qualities the people they want the family they want the children then afterwards they understand what they dreamed what they wanted from their children it is not possible for them to give it to them so their desire is always there oh my okay i gave so much to my son to my daughter to my children now i am not getting back as i was thinking was thinking your mind you were imagining it's not possible same way with the friends same way with the relatives oh that relative when he was in this race i helped now he is not coming to me when i am i need so then all these complaints are always there in our mind and we go on complaining and all the time we are unhappy so who is unhappy me who is suffering me why it is my thought so we have to understand this way if i can change my thought that is the mastery one must become the master of one's own mind you know all the hindu swamis they particularly the tsunami sampraday the that is shankaracharya made they get the award the swami s-w-a-a my swami swami means the master master of whom master of his own mind he should become the master of his own mind the bhagavad-gita krishna is mentioning the scriptures are also asking us you have to control your mind then we can go and what will avail a man to have mere scholarship a pandit pandit means sanskrit scholar may have studied many scriptures he may recite many sacred texts but if he is still attached to the world and if inwardly he loves the is having lost in gold then he has not assimilated the contents of the scriptures for such a man the study of scripture is futile the almanac forecast the rainfall for the year you may squeeze the book but you won't get a drop of water not even a single drop so laughter all people started laughing though sirama krishna this is very special whatever he will say immediately he will give an example and in that example he is mentioning like that the things are there written in the book but if you are trying to squeeze the book will you get a drop of rain no girish goes he liked it he's smiling and repeating the same what did you say said about squeezing the almanac won't a single drop of water come out of it all laughed sirama krishna with a smile the pandits talk big but where is their mind fixed on lost and gold on creature comforts and money the vulture so very high in the sky but its eyes are fixed on the kernel pit it is continually looking for the kernel petes and the dead bodies to girish narendra is a boy of very high order now look at it we began the discourse we began the conversation of agava krishna with the discussion of narendra and about narendra he is giving the he is introducing the future leader and narendra himself was not doing but the god knew that he is going to take up the cause of religion true religion and going to march forward and he is telling narendra is a boy of very high order he excels in everything vocal and instrumental music and studies again he has control over his saints organs he is truthful and has discrimination and dispassion so me so many virtues in one person to aim to master mashay what do you say isn't it unusually good friends if we notice that this was at at least two years before is passing away and he is it is 85 86 the lord passed away so all within one year a few months were left these are the people greece chandra ghosh master maha there are householder devotees and sirama krishna slowly bringing up the young man narendra not because he will lead the whole organization and for that a monastic life is necessary a householder it won't be possible for them because they have other duties so that those duties and then they are coming it is not not possible the sannyasins are not having any bondages they are not married they have not having the children no family so obviously the whole 24 hours they can concentrate on this holy life not only for personal but also for the society moksha jagat atman moksha anyone can do so helping the one's own self it is possible but going out and serving the others inspiring others and helping others too much going forward for the god realization is a huge task so sirama krishna how wonderfully introducing the narendra and at the same time the the words that he has used those are the qualities that god loved he said the narendra is a boy of high order he's telling he's successful in everything vocal instrumental music studies again now he's telling he has a control over his saints organs this is most important he's truthful he has the discrimination and dispassion bichara and vadagya so these are the qualities that will take us towards god and these are the qualities we god's blessings will come on us thank you friends we'll stop over here and in the next wednesday again we'll meet we will discuss so if there is any question yeah there is one question from satish patel he's saying how can i get rid of ego and attachment to worldly things satish ji is a very important question a party and christian the moment we can go beyond the ego immediately we become god you can understand that the ego is the only carton that is not allowing us to see god god is there it is not that we will go and get the god it is there already but the ego is covering it now how to bhagavan suramar krishna suggested that whatever we do we have to think because of the god i can do it suppose i am a very good singer i am singing i'm getting a position from the society from the audiences now i must internally go on praying to god it is because of you oh god i could do it i am successful in any walks of life this is the way we can become humble oh god because of you i am successful and that is the only way thank you srima biswas is asking what is selfishness the when a person is thinking about himself or herself only that is selfishness so whatever happens you will find that sometimes in the in the market when some scarcity of food the people will go and punch on that they will take as maximum food possible never thinking what will happen to others who are coming after me and it is not necessary and if we have to die let all of us will die no i will grab everything only me and my family will survive let everyone die can he survive when everybody is not there so this type of attitude is called selfishness thank you thank you friends let us churn this mantra and offer our pranam to god [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music]
