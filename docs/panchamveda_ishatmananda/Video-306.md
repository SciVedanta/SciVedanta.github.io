[307. Panchama Veda 307 - “Sri Ramakrishna: A Bridge between Nitya and Leela”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mp_MbkpmoI)

their devotees and friends let us begin our discourse on the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna tabakat written [Music] he was talking with the devotees and the devotees after listening they were wondering is he a man of knowledge or a man of devotion so a devotee pointing to another devotee was telling he has the attitude of the gopis gopis you know those who are following the uh these classes are the students of bhitantha the gopis the reference to those wonderful minds and there was to love sri krishna the ladies the gopa gopis so he has the attitude of a love for god then the rama ramjandra and he was a doctor immediately saying no he has both the attitude of tender love and attitude of austere knowledge then the master when he heard that they were talking about him he it didn't clearly understand what actually they were talking so he asked ask them what is it that you are talking about sirama krishna inquired about surendra so they didn't reply maybe just they just laughed and uh because they were gazing they were sadana krishna's actual mood so it is unthinkable almost from all types of human moods we can say the human attitudes the human uh the way of thinking krishna approach through all those that is why is the unique personality krishna sherhudy mentioned is a phenomena so uncomparable and no one in the history of religion we find they practice like that as someone practices through the path of devotion someone from path of knowledge someone to the path of karma or dhyana there are but one who has not only traveled through all this he has also the other philosophies and other religions the other faiths each and every one he is the colossal he himself is the parliament of all religions so how it is possible now here slowly we will come to the today's topic is the bridge between the nitya and the leela nitta is the brahman and leela is the manifestation of the same brahman as this world so he is the bridge so this uniquely in the upanishad it says it's a bridge we need a bridge without the bridge we cannot reach over there now he has created us now he that supreme being whom we call god has come down has taken the form of sirama krishna and he is showing us the path he is the goal he is the path he is also the guide this is the uniqueness of bhagavan sirama krishna he is living with us and he's guiding us he is leading to this path which will take us to the ultimate and what is that ultimate which each and every human being is searching that is peace that is joy and ultimate joy is called peace we are constantly searching for that and srirama krishna is leading and when we reach to that surama krishna that bliss we find oh this is srama krishna himself he was guiding us and he was showing us the path and he then ultimately when you reach we find it is he only he is the goal and he is the guide and he is the way that he is the bridge between the nitta and the leela we will come to that and here the rambabu here waiting about you etc etc now we have already completed that girish saluted the master and took his leave devendra and the other devotees took the master to his carriage seeing that one of the neighbors was sound asleep on the on a bench in the courtyard devendra woke him up that's a very funny thing this person from the neighborhood came to meet and listen to bhagavan's ramakrishna he heard a holy person is coming to visit that house so he came now maybe he was tired and so he was sleeping on the bench at the courtyard and and he slept so fast and yes ramakrishna came everything happened all the discourses on the and also at the the prasadam everything everyone got the food and the poor man was sleeping and nobody noticed and when they were returning back then noticing that gentleman is sleeping over there that devendra went and told hey why who are you and why you are sleeping over here he got up and he said has the parameter come paramahamsa and that way the people used to they call bhagavan ramakrishna paramaham means the supreme it's a sanskrit term parama supreme hamsa means the swan the paramahamsa is the symbol of the brahman paramahamsa is the symbol of that god the why the swan because it is floating on the water but not awake by the water and that is the beauty it is in the world mixing with all people visiting different people talking with people but at the same time never ever touched by the greed the loss the anger the jealousy the competition nothing what are the all the traits of the world all the time people are like that and that is all this is free from that like the swan in the water the paramahamsa living in this world so this is the paramahamsa so he has the paramahamsa come all burst into laughter the man had come a long time before sirama krishna's arrival and because of the heat had sprayed a mat on the bench let down and gone into sound asleep so this is a symbol that sometimes some people you know before we read that some people came to visit sirama krishna and they're from the neighbor but they didn't like his talking so they didn't like the god and they left and sudama krishna also mentioned what type of people are this they are not liking the spiritual discussion they don't like to know they are also practicing spirituality also called religion but they are always they're closing their eyes and they think whatever they have understood that is sufficient did not like don't like to open their mind they don't like to receive the the great ideas so we will come to the next chapter the 39 is the page english page is 743 and bengali the complete book published by the utmodhan it is 793 english 743 and bengali 793 now these are the people who are coming here sitting and listening but they are not impressed why the siram krishna is the simple the god is simple just natural normal we are gods but unnecessarily we have superimposed unknowingly superimposed or some time when we grow up in in that atmosphere and that uh in the society we slowly uh think that we are these we are bad we should follow these we should follow that we should eat these we should not eat that all sorts of thing but the good is so simple it has nothing to do with what are the dresses we are wearing or food we are eating nothing like that it is the mind what is that my they're free from the bondage and what is this bondage craving all our desires and where from the desire come i me mine so ultimately we have to go to that ego that bhagavan sram krishna pointed out the ego and if we can uproot that then there is no connection though we are living in the world but we know that we are not bound by this world by that we we are completely free and that is spirituality that is religion and there is no question of hating whom to hate why because the god has become that he is just behaving like that he has become the king and he has become the subject he is behaving like that the subject he himself is playing in there and the scripture also he has written the the moment we understand these we are free that's called the religion is realization what is the realization what to understand this so this is the unique way bhagavan si rama krishna the god himself the gold himself the bridge himself he's trying to guide us but some unfortunate one will never listen they like to close their eyes and they like to go and the same the path they think that is the they will also reach but in a roundabout way after experiencing lot of the miseries and downfalls and all that let them go in their own way but we should follow the whole the hand of bhagavatama krishna our spiritual guide and will follow the path of bhagavan sirama krishna then it is the master's reminiscences the our the teacher master mahashaya is recording it that is the april 12 1885. sri ramakrishna was sitting in the devotee with balarama's drawing room in calcutta that calcutta is a very holy place for those who are following the path of bhagavan sirama krishna and kamar puku jairambhati these are the very close to calcutta not very far so maybe two three hours drive and one can reach over there these are the very holy places because bhagavan's rama krishna he took the human form as ramakrishna and he played over there then he came to calcutta as that krishna was born in mathura and grew up over there in brindavan and mathura and then he went to delhi and then afterwards of course and towards the gujarat and he stayed over there that his main field of action was then delhi so this is the way the krishna and sirama krishna main field of work was calcutta so he used to visit different houses and this north calcutta now they say north calcutta the there was a very rich person and very humble so god liked him because of his humbleness he was rich but at the same time he was very humble so god loved those who are really humble blessed are the mick but they shall see god so that is the way the make the humble though he is educated though he is having the money but no boastfulness no showing off of the ego oh i am rich and these are nothing like that so god love this so we have to learn from here these are the very clear indication it is nothing wrong if you are having education nothing wrong if you are having the money but one should be very humble so that is the main thing the surama krishna coming to that balarama's drawing room and now that balarama's house that their ancestors they they're also you know i should say the very kind-hearted people and religious people they donated that house to the ramakrishna mission because so many direct disciples of bhagavan sri ramakrishna stayed over there there was nothing that this is the 125th year of the ramakrishna mission is coming and ramakrishna mission was formed in that building bhagavan sirama krishna who never used to go to anybody's house visited more than 100 times to this house you can imagine how blessed that family so that our srama krishna the god he was there sitting in the drawing room arrived at three o'clock it means the master master is the recorder and girish balarama the younger norin pultu [Music] and many other devotees were there that those who are following the pages of the gospel of sirama krishna now acquainted with these names of the devotees shortly three look kashanal jai gopal sheen and other members of the brahma samaj arrived brahma samaj but still they used to like to listen to bhagavan siddharam krishna they loved to converse with him to learn from him and they were learned people they were in the high and of the society and though they were following a different path they were trying to develop that the brahma samaj but they used to come to suramar krishna and they all came many women devotees were present also seated behind the screen that was the tradition in those days the the women devotees used to sit in a behind us screen they never used to sit before the male people and that came much afterwards the previously he was not there in the hindu society afterwards because of the political and social changes this change came so they were also there among them was mohini's wife who had almost gone in sin on account of a son's death there were a few other afflicted souls like who used to visit the master to obtain peace of mind sirama krishna was describing to the devotees the various incidents of his sadhana and the phases of his spiritual realization now friends there are the afflictions there are sufferings there are insults there are please and there are acceptances there are so many things goes on in the life any human life means like this sometimes we say oh at the time of sri ramachandra everybody was so happy no rama had to fight and punish so many people his own wife mother shita was abducted by the ravana people were there so bad and good people all through and we find the rishis are coming and requesting sri rama to go and punish the bad people who are disturbing their regular worships and regular practices bad people were also there at the time of rama but we have to live with this the good and bad will always will be there we are imagining that if we go to heaven everything will be so good of course that will be good comparing with uh with this present the worldly life but imagine the some devotees will be there so close to god some devotees will be there according to their mental attitude according to their karma of allah they will be little away from god won't there be jealousy i think there will be because that is the nature though less but giving up all those things they could reach to god but still there will be there because the duality so this we have to understand what we are learning we are learning this do we we have to go to the source and how by giving up all desire what type of desire craving i should have these i should have that i should be pleased by each and every one i should not be criticized by anyone all these type of thoughts are distracting us and when we think in this world that i am the mother my son has passed away i am the father my son has supposed to be of course the attachment is so close a terrible pain but if you can't overcome this pain who is suffering that person if i am that i am suffering i am thinking that somebody is thinking bad about me i am thinking whether the other people are really thinking bad or not i don't know i am imagining hundreds and thousands of people are suffering only through this imagination constantly we imagine educated people and they came i know few of them they came from india settled over here they're good engineers they used to have the good work just they developed a peculiar imagination the people are trying to harm them people are doing these this is terrible thing and how to overcome this just think of god the god is there he is my father he is taking care of you why should i have to if the people are trying to harm me let them do i don't care because i know i'm protected by god this is called faith and that is called spirituality and that is realization so sirama krishna is now telling this thing to encourage people what those people master mahashay wrote afflicted people this the life which is burning which is afflicted full of sorrow and i don't know where to go and the in the bible shankaracharya is excellently he's explaining [Music] if possible many of you have must have read the vivek choramine if you read excellent and so political way the shankara is explaining that i am running through this jungle fire all around me it is fire it is going to burn me i don't have anyone no god or guru except you i don't have anyone if you feel like that then you will never be and at least attest to this world you are there in the world but are not of the world this is spirituality understanding this so sirama krishna he is explaining to them the divine mother would put me in such a state that sometimes my mind would come down from nitya to the leela and sometimes go up from the lila to the nithya nikta and leela these are the two words he has mentioned the sometimes before i received a letter from a gentleman he also wanted to know about this nitta and leela nitya literally the sanskrit word nitya literally means eternal no changes what is that brahman the consciousness all pervading consciousness but the problem is we cannot imagine that particular state it is constantly the same but we are right from the birth and also before this birth so many births we have taken and every time we are accustomed to understand things with diversity there will be different people they'll be educated uneducated poor and rich and uh the male female these that so so so many diversities now suddenly if we try to understand there is nothing is there it is only the one then how we can imagine how we can realize that and that is called sadhana and that is the truth we have to reach it is all one it is not two the sirama krishna is mentioning you know that in the it is said that renunciation uh after 12 years of his great sadhana after 12 years of his unprecedented human austerities the divine mother told him that you remain in bhabha muka keeping the mind on the border line between absolute that is nitta and the relative that is leela the nitta and the leelah suramar krishna completed all different types of his practices the most of you know by now and those who don't i will request you to read the biography of sudama krishna of all the religious history this is the only and the unique person person i should say the god took that for human form sirama krishna and it was necessary for the present-day human being to know that all paths are leading to the same goal when the same suramar krishna came in the form of rama or in the form of krishna as he himself said some people may admit or may not but that doesn't matter this is the truth and the truth is the same god the supreme being taking different time different human form and trying to guide us but how he is guiding us at the time of sri rama completely different way at the time of sri krishna and another way at the time of sri ramakrishna as a society already became very modern very developed so it was it was necessary to guide them in a completely different way you know when we were children and our parents were children that time their parents and their teachers they thought that when they to make the child attentive you must sometimes use the cane the rod so that the child will understand having the physical pain oh my god if i don't do these then again i will get the beating and nowadays most of the modern countries they're banned you cannot do anything like that on a child so how they have guiding them because children are have also grown up their intellectual the iq is also has developed and slowly slowly their understanding that if i don't do this i am going to lose and when the mother of the father they are just explaining their understanding so this way the human society we handle according to the situation and the presumptive world in the now this is the 19th 20th 21st century when the bhagavatam krishna he wants to guide us these very advanced people those who are sending the rockets to moon and the mars for them what is religion oh the god is sitting on that and the high on the top of the himalaya if you go over there no they won't believe it immediately they will ask question there are so many satellites thousands of satellites now they are observing every inch of the world and the earth now tell me where is god you cannot simply say like that you have to explain it that's why the vedanta is accepted all over the modern world what is this vedanta says just analyze logically try to understand what is this that bhagavan is giving and now we have to understand very logically what is this nitya and what is this lila nitya is eternal unchanging and leela exactly oppose it constantly changing these are the two condition nithya unchanging lila changing and both are there and there is a bridge from the leela the changing constantly there is a nit there through the unchanging in the upanishad also we find this type of references in a one tree two birds they were sitting of the same plumage they were apparently they were both same but one was quietly seating unperturbed undisturbed and inaction he was not doing anything the same the other one he was hopping from this brunch to that branch and picking this one a fruit that fruit sometime good sometime bitter and that experiences then suddenly he saw the other bird and he wondered how come that he is calm so composed why he is not behaving like me then the question came as the same question came in the mind of gotham who afterwards became buddha how come when all people are suffering a man with a geruah with a saffron clad as a sannyasi as a monk how he can retain his calmness and his face is beaming with joy how it is possible because of this so this is nitya and leela those who have god that nithya aspect of nitya understood that or trying to reach over there their character changes and those who are in the leela always changing always changing sometimes in the below the wave and sometimes on the top of the crest of that and they are very happy again they are suffering again they are happy it goes on as the wave goes on up and down the suramar krishna is mentioning he completed all his sadhana i am mentioning from the great master where srama krishna heard that the order came from the supreme that you should remain in bhabha mukha the sudama krishna i thought that my purpose is done i came over here i wanted to know the which path is leading to which goal then i found that all paths are leading to the same goal all paths are leading to the same goal there's the himalaya the mount everest the mountaineers they always like to go over there some they will be climbing from indian side two three paths are there and some will be from the nepal they're all aft ultimately reaching to the same top of the mountain on the summit they see the same experience those who are climbing from the side of the nepal or from the india when they will reach on the top what they will see what will be their experience same experience it cannot be different from the nepal side they are coming up oh we saw there is a huge lake on the top of the himalaya will they say like that neighbor even if they say of course nowadays all scientific things are there from the satellite they will say nothing is there so their experience are the same but why we fight oh you are coming from nepal side oh we are not going to talk with you you are not my friend why should we the same way the someone is coming and going towards the god from one path and he said that this is the path of the buddha as the path of the hindus the path of the christians path of the muslims part of these parts of that let there be so many paths what is the problem but reaching to the goal on the top on the summit what do you experience tell us that until and unless you reach to that experience that just on the hearsay if you fight with others well people will tell you are an ignorant so ignoring people only they fight not knowing themselves where they are going they'll be fighting thinking oh my path is the best why ego again so nitta and the leela we need a bridge and sudama krishna is the bridge he is that preach to that eternity it says it's a bridge to the eternity krishna wanted to give up now the mother said no you have to and what is this is a it's like keeping the mind on the border line between the absolute we are using the english word absolute no changes just imagine no changes at all that is nithya in the again the sanskrit will say it is nithya nictu means always every time every moment eternally is the same that is called nitya and then in the relative plane the leela why this relative plane it is different when someone is looking at something we went to some place and so many other tourists were there we were looking at the same site that and people are explaining in different way it always happened i look at that that on the top of the hill standing here oh look at that the sunlight is showing so wonderful golden glow and from this thing another golden you say but come here and see it it's just silver the same light the same place a different people from different angle they are seeing in a different way and that is called relative but absolute no change if you reach to that absolute it will be always the same if not you have not reached the absolute if you see differences know it for sure that you have not reached to that ultimate point so nitta and leela we need someone who has already gone over there and come back and tell us it is really really there it is there something which never changes truly we heard about the rishis and maharishi's who went over there and came back and in great joy they said srindan to bishop oh the children of the immortal police listen to me i have gone and what is there is this the place no is it time no what is it beyond ignorance i was there it was there with me all through but i never knew suddenly with the grace of that supreme the black curtain removed i saw that and i can't express it i'm sorry because i cannot express it in any language so that way they say that i have seen that but i say they will be telling if you follow this this this way you can reach over there you can surely reach over there so sirama krishna is mentioning after reaching he wanted to remain into that absolute but someone told him guided him no no no no you have to become a bridge you remain over there and you should be the bridge between nitta and the leela you are the amritas the word that has been used in the upanishad can be applicable only with the suramar krishna amrita is the bridge of eternity bridge to eternity at will he could go to the attributeless brahman nitya attributeless what is the attribute satya rajatama we understand in that way oh that is a good person okay there's a mixture of good and bad and the bad person the good bad and the mixture this always whenever we judge a person we judge in that way and you'll find nowadays whenever you go to an astronaut even to the astronaut they will go to their webpage and see what is that comments are there the people will judge they will say give the number 4.8 number you have got and the comment is uh good people this is okay but don't give prasad so no to number so 4.8 like that why you can't got the question not got the prasad i'm joking so this is the way if you are talking like this so you go and you see and when everything is all right you give the number after seeing that number other people are coming it may be for the things that you are going to purchase from the shops when you are going to different shops you are purchasing and then you go and check what is good what is bad its okay about the hotels it is okay but about the holy people holy places now you have to go yourself and see because the reactions are completely different sometimes when you go will you see the same place same person your reaction will be oh what is a wonderful place and wonderful people i like to come back as it happened in the life of master marsha he also went with his friend and relative but that friend and relative who took him introduced he never came back he never liked that place he never liked that bhagavatama krishna we never see that he is coming and meeting him again second time but we find all the pages of the gospel of sirama krishna and many other times maybe this master masha been to her there why so if you master masha suppose if master moshe inquired from sidhu how do you like that place that she does oh if you go by the bank of the river ganga okay this is wonderful the flower garden is there you will you will enjoy but inside if you go there as an elderly person sitting over there giving the talk sometimes some people are sitting before him i don't like that and inside the temple the priests are all worshiping i don't think i'm not much impressed but if you go yeah that is a good place and that garden is there you can go and see it and you can whistle if you like and hearing that if the person deciding not to visit the dakshinesha and salama what a great loss the same way it is very every individual according to the karmapala if you come to that place immediately you will feel this is my place and i like to be here that attractions will be there and if you are not that is not your place maybe somewhere else so this is the way if we understand then we understand so this is the example of the nithyan lila sirama krishna was sitting on the border of absolute unchangeable brahman and next step coming out in the leela where so many things are going on happening because of the attributes so one is attribute less brahman and also come down to the relative world seeing it in the manifestation of the god alone it's a god alone it is not a separate thing it's not a different thing the brahman is different the world is different no the god same god examples of nitya again in the that the great master it says when totapuri the great advaitan teacher left dakshinesha after spending there for 11 months usually this type of sannyasis they never stay more than three nights in one place because then they will develop the relations and they will develop likings disliking in hindi in indian language they will say ramtha sadhu bahata pani as the when the water is flowing the it is all clean and similarly a monk should also move around so you will not develop attachment for any place of the people they used to but here this person he lived for 11 months instead of three nights he was also learning from bhagavan sirama krishna because he was the bhagavan and the tota puri he was a very perfected soul but still he was thinking this way that way the same narrow thinking only through the path of knowledge one can reach god not the path of devotion so he used to argue with sadama krishna and slowly slowly sudama krishna though the disciple but the supreme lord and made him understand that it is possible for everything is possible for god and whatever you see is nothing but the same manifestation whatever you see is nothing but that you in the again in the indian language the sanskrit the hindi there's a song whatever is there is nothing but that is the realization of krishna is mentioning that he was practicing what happened sudama krishna decided to remain united with the brahmana and non-dual state friends this portion is very important because we don't have any experience no one could tell actually what happened when the say nitya the eternal what happens over there no one can see but sudama krishna through his that's why he was mentioning not that to get the clapping from the people he was telling to give us the understanding what happens over there then he was telling like this in this state there remain no connection of i and mind you and yours or the idea of one or two it is the reality beyond imagination we cannot imagine even that is the reality the illumined person realizes within himself through samadhi the infinite and indestructible brahman indescribable brahman the source of knowledge and the absolute please now here source of knowledge and absolute bliss we get a hook to understand we understand joy we understand happiness and we anchor for the happiness we anchor for the joy now absolute maybe thousand or million times more that happiness is blessed maybe and in that way we can imagine the please so this is the word that we should remember in nirvikalpa samadhi there is only bliss and more bliss anandam it is only bliss is more please so what is the goal ananda is the goal is that bliss the joy and we think we'll go and eat that particular food and i will get joy of course he will get temporary we think we will go and go and meet that friend of course he will get some joy temporary because again he will leave and you will be again the parting is there meeting and partying these are same the averse and the rivers of the same coin so when we are meeting we are happy but after some time we have to say goodbye so that is called parting but here it is only please and please alone and nothing else so what you are searching god and what is this god please and when after practicing spirituality we become angry we become cruel we become the killers stop stand before a meter and ask am i truly going towards god no the answer is very clear so answer is if we are going towards the god it should be the joy it should be the happiness it should should be the please no hatred no jealousy no anger so this is the main shankaracharya i will quote from here the shankaracharya explained in the bible the verses 408 408 409 and 410 410 so this if we can understand so sorry so this is the way we have to understand this uh shankaracharya he is giving us the idea i'll quote only from one verse four zero eight if you are interested you can read four zero nine and four zero train obtained from the bible reality beyond imagination kimopi i don't know how to explain means what how can i explain this this is a very subjective you have to realize yourself so the beyond imagination you cannot imagine that this is this [Music] the continuous unchanging bodham the feeling kevalam only [Music] is the feeling of bliss can't stand the feeling of bleeds the friends we all have to remember this particular word anandam please that is the goal and that is the ultimate reality and that is god in different names we called it means you cannot have anything compared to that peerless because that is the only thing how can you compare it so if you have another tree you can compare it to another tree so this tree looks like that tree oh this is uh the palm tree it looks like the dead tree so like that we can say so this is a there is nothing how can you compare so it says sometimes they give the name that means there is no upoma there is no example the brahman has no any second one to compare nirupama otibilum unlimited so you cannot say oh this is the god and god eats only vegetable food and god looks like these god has only two hands or four hands or ten hands and god only leaves over here or blasphemy you don't believe in god god is all pervading god is all powerful the moment you limit his power you are criticizing god you are just an unbeliever there is a blasphemy to say any limit about god so utilum unlimited i have realized up to this friend if you go farther maybe you will realize a little more and no one can give the complete idea why otibe unlimited eternally free why eternally free no desire what is the bondage desire i like to purchase the nowadays the new fashion people like to purchase some electric uh the car and all that now everybody oh you have purchased the electric they're like that so desire is there that when any little desire is there you cannot reach over there he does nothing why he is not doing any action because he has no desire again we always do something when there is a desire the sinama krishna never wanted to do anything but the supreme being who came in that form thought that he should be a breed otherwise how people will understand so the whatever work he will do as bhagavan suramar krishna as an avatara that is there is no desire for that swami vivekananda they were not having any desire except love and that love only was the main thing inspiring them to do something for the people to talk to them to go to them to guide them to console them help them so that is the only love and nothing else at the behind it nothing and nothing and nothing neither would be needed [Music] explaining in this this way he tried to give an example you know how it is the sky when the we see the sky we see oh that is the in the horizon the sky is limited but it's unlimited then in the if you go through the plane it is much much bigger than we were seeing the sky standing on a field when you go to the rocket and all those astronauts will say oh unlimited where it is ending we do not know that is gaganah gagan of the sanskrit word i don't know how they coined this type of words the gaganah means unlimited you cannot imagine the end of it like the unlimited and when we say the god is only like this and god has this name god eats this god put like dress like this are you not limiting him for your sadhana of course it is good the god is my little krishna baby krishna or baby rama it's okay but the moment you say this is the only god and if you don't believe come let us fight that is the problem so we have to understand this and those who are behaving like that they are going away from god god doesn't like that he's neither over the nishkalam without a growth or decay then no growth no decay as it is without doubt when i was going somewhere i went in india someone old uh the devotees they saw and they love me so they told maharaj you never change you are looking the same i took out the cap and showed them see previously it was all covered with hair and now it is very less here so am changing i am not nishkalam and just in a jokingly very said the color because i was a little baby then he became a young boy then a young man and then slowly an old person and then i will die in the color it is changing the body is changing mind is changing so i am not that but within me the consciousness which always say observed my changes in the body my changes in the mind that is the brahmana and that brahman i should realize and i will say brahmapurnam samadou and then illumined one realizes in samadhi the absolute brahman which is full of bliss and more please friends i think i think we should stop over here and continue and the experiences at the bhagavad game over me the mind left the plane of the leela and ascended to the nitya i found no distinction between the cigarette tulsi and ordinary sajna plant i no longer enjoyed seeing the forms of god so this is bhagavan sirama krishna and his experience we will continue sirama krishna the bridge between the nitta and the leelah thank you is there any question yes raj is asking often people comment and ask questions about spiritual paths with full pre-justice just to boost their ego it is easy to avoid if they are strangers but when they are our own family what to do so the year you have to be clever because you know maybe they are very close relatives maybe their father mother grandfather grandmother very close but still in the path of religion this relation has nothing you have to understand in the path of religion for other things okay you must have to take their guidances because their experience but in the path of religion you should take the path or teachings of those who have realized like bhagavan sirama krishna caitanya mahaprabhu etc so i should think it is better to be quiet when they are guiding and try to analyze the what are the good things are there in their in their teachings but at the same time when you are reading the scripture listening to the good at the discord says if you feel that that is the path try to follow that thank you ashvaraj has a two-part question surya nandaji once mentioned to sadhu sadhu shanthanath that when hanuman talks about the three attributes he means that lord can be realized through all three part two my question is it is easier to understand jiba buddhi and ahmadi leading to union with god but their buddhi leads to union with god is hard to contemplate how to contemplate it see that you have understood it very correctly that uh when the de habiti so when i am feeling that i am a separate body then i am humble i am like a servant i listen to you and obey your commands and when above that so i know that it is you and me at the bird so like that you have understood this and whatever the path you feel is good for you you follow but remember like every other knowledge spiritual knowledge also requires some practices some what's called the training and that is called satya then tyaga atma samyama and the all these so that i think you are practicing you have practiced and you have to practice that without all those practices simply thinking that i am the one with god it may be a wonderful imagination but it may not be the reality i'm sorry so thank you the next question is from jeff he's saying in english in course bliss sometimes means people so happy that they are oblivious to all things around them right is there a deep is there a deeper description of ananda than bliss uh you know the jiff of course that it is very difficult to explain so the ultimately they chose as another translate the ananda as beliefs not happiness or joy because bliss has to some extent we can say assam and the quality of the ananda but when we saw ananda that means the absolute joy and when the shiva is dancing his imagination because it is so full of joy cannot contain it cannot lie down it cannot sleep it cannot see it so he's dancing with great joy so that is called the ananda you know in vedanta in one of the punishers when one rishi he found that joy he cried out and he couldn't say any full sentence or word he only some of the syllables of great joy he said ah [Music] like that so it is the great joy yureka yureka you like that so it is very difficult to explain or to coin any word to explain that it isn't a individual resolved personal experience thank you jeff so thank you friends and let us conclude with this mantra by [Music] [Music] namaste
