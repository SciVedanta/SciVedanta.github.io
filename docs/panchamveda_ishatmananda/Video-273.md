[274. Panchama Veda 274 : Sir What Will Happen To These Sinners?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP_y4zwWles)

their devotees and friends today this wednesday so it's little the defect came in and that's why we are little late uh 15 minutes late so let us begin begin with the this our mantra taboo friends last wednesday we have discussed how one can begin with nistha and sincerity nishta and slowly slowly end up in the grand summit of prema prema means that is love of god in the path of devotion that is the ultimate the praying bhagavatam krishna he was discussing at the star theater with girish and other devotees and it was sunday december 1884 and we are reading from the english book page 681 hearing the wonderful realization of the mohave hanumanji who said o rama sometimes i find that you are the whole and i am a part sometimes that you are the master and i am your servant o rama when i have all the knowledge of reality i see you and i and i am you you are i and i am you these feelings is a the ultimate of the vidanta view vidanta path so from the prema the path of the devotion we reach to prema and through the path of the gyana this is the oneness with the ultimate reality hearing this the girish he was very happy and he said ah that he liked that statement of mahabhirji then bhagavan sirama krishna he is continuing why shouldn't the man be able to realize god in the world anyone anywhere must be able to realize god if it is not of course they should follow some process and sincerely perfectly if he or she can follow the process is supposed to get the realization of god if not there must be some defect in the process itself so that's why bhagavan's rama krishna when he's talking with the devotees the householder devotees he's mentioning why shouldn't a man be able to realize god in the world then he said but he must have discrimination and dispassion he must have the unshakable awareness that god alone is real and all else is unreal now these are the three things that if the qualities these are the processes if we follow anyone in this world anywhere will realize god what is that first is discrimination what is the discrimination in sanskrit it's called bichara what is the bichara what is the analysis and what is this that we like to know really understand it says this world is completely temporary it is not real and when you understand that then dispassion we are not at all attached to this world for anything and what is this word nama rupa only name and form and how we enjoy this nama rupa through five senses the eye the nose the taste the tongue and the skin and the ear the this pancha bhuta in five objects that are there rupa russia sabda gandha etc so again and again we have discussed that in the students of vedanta they know it but this is the only problem [Music] that is binding us that we are thinking that this world is permanent and we like to get the enjoyment over here with these objects we get that enjoyment we can say little joy little happiness but after some time all that is lost it goes away so this is the way always it goes so obviously if one understand it well we will live we in this world and we know that we have to live we have to survive and for that we need a house we need a car we need something and all those things but when we think that we are these are the permanent things and we have to completely jump on that only to get these and nothing else then obviously we are bound so this is the only difference and nothing else so friends we have to understand that bhagavan sirama krishna is telling why shouldn't a man be able to realize god in the world of course he will be but he must have discrimination which order understanding and analy capacity to analy analyze that this world is temporary and when he can analyze that he will have the dispassion no attachment these are the main two steps then what happens he must have the unshakable awareness that god alone is real unshakable awareness oh god may be real ah sometimes i feel not like that once and for all that god is only the reality and nothing else if the these three things are there it doesn't matter whether we are a monk or a nun or a householder married bachelor nothing so that's why bhagavan sirama krishna is telling so these are the three things then he said it will not do to float on the surface you must dive deep sudama krishna is a god himself so he has come to establish dharma and what is this dharma the dharma is the first and foremost thing the god is there the sudama krishna is giving us the that conviction the god is there and you should not think even for a second that god is not there if we want to realize god so this small four lines only giving us the wonderful idea and also the hope anyone any period of time anywhere can realize god with these three but he must be sincere so he said it will not do to float on the surface float on the surface means so we are thinking about god we are talking about god we are reading about god and a small group we are discussing all these things are good but one must be sincere to the born and praying day and night that is you must dive deep then he is singing dive deep oh mind dive deep in the ocean of god's beauty if you dissent to the uttermost depths there you will find the gem of love this is a beautiful song in bengali amar moon ultimate the goal of the path of devotion but bhagavan si ramakrishna said it is not possible for the ordinary people to have the prema that is because of that ultimate thing but one who is dub diving deep into the heart what is that ocean dup dub dub roop shagure amar moon ocean of god's beauty roop sagar sagar means the ocean so what is god's beauty god alone is there but look at it oh my mind the same god has become varieties of flowers different type of people animals birds sky sun moon so many things the beauty and now i go down and like to see from where all these things are coming up when ebedantin is going towards the one the only brahman is the truth brahma satya jaganth mitha this jagat this world this phenomena is nothing but temporary so it is mithya it was not there in reality only we imagine so that is why it is mithya so if this way we can think srama krishna is singing and then he said you must remember another thing in the ocean there is danger of alligators that is to say of last and the like now he is giving the hint about the practice spiritual practice first he said that anyone can realize god only you should have the discriminative capacity to understand what is truth what is permanent and what are the temporary things among the temporary things everything comes including my body and mind now we should go to the permanent then if we try to go to the permanent we have to give up all attachment for the temporary things this is two things then we should have the deep the conviction the only god is there then what about this world is the manifestation of the god in different forms that conviction so when i am behaving with them living with them how i will live how i will behave as i am behaving with them living with them i constantly have to think the god has become a bad person god has become a good person god has become the animal and also all these now what will happen when i think about these friends don't mix up with the day-to-day life we are now going to a very deep down understanding of the philosophy of spirituality and that is god alone only is there and nothing else god alone exists on the basis of that when you are analyzing yes there are bad people there are good people there are terrible types of animals are there all they are there each and everything including that insect which is crawling on the floor is also the same god because the consciousness is there when the consciousness is there we can say yes is the same now the nama and rupa are constantly changing that consciousness which is there now on into that insect may change to an animal maybe a bird maybe someday a human being but it is just changing the bodies the name and form and different type of activities then ultimately it will go and merge with the swords now because we have traveled all those things have come over here only one step in and then we are going to see the root we are going to see the source we are going to understand that we are the same god and when we reach to that height it's called prima the love love for that particular knowledge so this is the way we are so that's why we have to understand accordingly we have to behave also suramar krishna said now there is a trouble what is the trouble and he said it's like the danger is there like the alligators the crocodiles and that is to say the last and the like the first is the last last means the desire tremendous desire and that desire for the physical comfort that takes us down to any level so we have to control that and he's telling you must remember another thing in the ocean there is danger of alligators and that is to say of last and the lie girish is telling i am not afraid of the king of death then i am not afraid of death not most people they say boastfully sirama is telling not paying much heat to that but i am speaking of the danger of the alligators of lost and the like not about the death that is only one part of life what is life when you feel that you are surviving what is death when you feel that you are not surviving that's all only a little change and like the day and the night the daytime you can see the nighttime you cannot see the same thing the thing that we see now in the daytime in the dark we cannot see it is just like that life and death suramar krishna is telling i am not talking about that i am talking about the problems that are waiting on the path of god realization and what is that the desire i am not speaking of the danger of the alligator i am i am speaking of the danger of the alligators of last and the like because of them one should smear one's body with turmeric before diving in the turmeric of discrimination and dispassion is giving in the in the words you know that tarmac sometimes people though the those who go for uh the fishery where they go for the the fishermen that they know all these type of things you know then the villages they'll be using the turmeric powder on the body and sometimes because of the smell and whatever it may be the alligators they go away from those people so suramar krishna is telling like that but this is the just the giving the example but what is it is mean he wants to say the be careful about the strong desire for physical comfort some attain knowledge of god in the world mention is made of two class of yogis the hidden and the known those who have renounced the world are known yogis all recognize them but the hidden yogis live in the world they are not known they are like the maidservant who perform her duties in the house but whose mind is fixed on our children in the country the sudama krishna is giving beautiful example you know the people who are there in the household sometimes we think oh they're householders they're not getting that recognition of a monk when a monk goes people naturally among the hindus the highly respected the monks because they have left their heart and home they will go and take their blessings sometimes they're touching their feet to get the blessings and all that but there are people in the household the married people but their mind is constantly on god sama krishna is mentioning about them the hidden yogis the known yogi yogi means the united united with what united with god those whose mind is always united with god at the yogis even putting on this girl if people are thinking about political power social recognition name fame money maybe he is putting on the monk's dress but he is just a ordinary householder but a householder though he is not putting on the monks the dress and he is having the wife the children the responsibility the wealth but his mind is constantly connected with the god salama krishna is talking about them and he is telling they are not known they are like the maidservant who is serving doing the duties but knows oh this is my mother this is my father my family my responsibility my wealth my bank account all they are doing but constantly they are thinking about god like the met servant serving in the master's house but the mind is always at the village where she has left our children they are also as i have told you like the loose women who perform her household duties jealously but whose mind constantly dwells on her lover salaam krishna is not appreciating but he's only using these examples where the mind is so that's why it's very hard to cultivate discrimination and dispassion it is not easy to get rid of the idea i am the master of all these and all these are mine i saw a deputy magistrate who earns a salary of 800 rupees paying no attention to the religious discourse he had brought one of his children with him and was busy feeding and finding a good place for him to see it i know another man whom i shall not name who used to devote a great deal of time to japan but he bore false witness in court for the sake of ten thousand rupees therefore i say that a man can realize god in the world too but only if he has discrimination and dispassion two different examples from the householders suramar krishna is giving one is busy with his family with the children not caring about the religion though he has come to attain the religious the performance but not careful about that another apparently he is taking the name of god but at the same time he's telling the lies friends most of the time we will find this type of people they're giving donations for the constructions of the temple and they are going and meeting the holy people and showing great respect to them and sometimes they will be the first person he will see giving extra money they will enter into the the sanctum sanctorium of the temple where the other people from the distance they will have a glance of the god so these people they think that they are doing a great deal of spiritual practices by that way but they tell the lies for the money they cheat people surama krishna is telling nothing is happening to them they have to suffer for their karma of allah so we should not deceive ourselves when you are cheating is okay when you are doing something wrong it's okay i i am taking the responsibility i like this and i am doing it then why pretending that you are a religious person and you are talking about the religion reciting from the holy scripture that's why swami vivekananda said i can't stand everything but hypocrisy surama krishna is telling it is not that those who have left the heart and home only will realize god anyone can realize god but the three things again and again he is repeating that one you have to have the capacity to understand the temporariness of this world and then the capacity to withdraw the mind from this temporariness why should you tell lies to get 10 000 rupees when you know this world is temporary when you are taking the holy name of god at the same time you are telling the lies to get the money you're a hypocrite so that what bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling girish what will happen to this sinner when today's talk is what will happen to these sinners so that they are cedars why because they are not only deceiving the world they are deceiving themselves too so what is the scene this scene means now we know about that in hinduism the very specially they always say that this is one is god and his creation this world this material world it is nothing wrong if we are there in this material world and problem is if we think this is the only existence only reality and we like to do anything and everything to get a little benefit over here that is sin you know traditionally they always say there are six scenes what is that as bhagavan salam krishna again and again he is mentioning the last the karma it begins with the karma kama krodha lover moha mother and ma saria these are the six if these qualities are there this temperament mentalities are there then they are the sinners first is the karma the last the desire and then grow the anger when that last the kernel desire is not satisfied that person become angry and then come lower the greed whatever we see we like to grab we like to get we like to possess we are having so many things still we cannot stop we think we must have to and nowadays this is becoming too much in the society and this is in the name of professionalism i don't know where from the professional that means in by any hook and crook you have to be successful and they say we are professionals sometimes they will say oh nothing personal these are all professional thing what is it you are cheating people telling lies and then by that way you are getting a little success and little money and that you say professionalism where you are going ultimately you are thinking that you are successful you will be happy no you are putting the whole society into that suffering and yourself also as they call it in the hell fire the hindus they always say the fast you have to control your mind how will you control by discrimination by bichara and what is that bichara this world was there before me the world will be there after me so whatever i am doing and i've got the opportunity to do let me do something good for the people why should they harm them so that is the fast bichara that is the discrimination and then the when the discrimination comes you know how to control oh this is not this is not my cup of tea okay i won't take it you're not hard you're not using your cunningness to get that no somehow i must have to get it if not from the front door from the back door by who can cook no so this is the spiritual life and the spiritual life and suramar krsna's each and every word is the inspiration is the guidance for the spiritual life so that's why again and again i say it's the pan veda it's the knowledge the karma is the last the desire and then comes the krodha and lova the greed the karma is the ultimate but begins with the the greed the lower then because of the more heart the delusion we think oh this is wonderful that sometimes we read in the newspaper one young man he wanted to get a lady proposed her she refused then he became very angry and threw the acid on her face what is it this is because of the delusion and because of that the sinful act the heinous act he was arrested he was in the prison whole life he is also suffering and caused that lady also what he got from there but he can't think when he's thinking i am angry because the object that i wanted i didn't get well i will destroy it like that he is thinking because of the delusion and arrogance that is mother the arrogance i can do this i can do that and everywhere you will see in the movies in the other sources people are constantly going on increasing this type of passions in the mind of the people so we should be very careful because it is teaching the human being is nothing it can be a devil it can be a god if we can train him properly and it is only the mind bhagavan krishna and all the scriptures of the hindus and other religions they constantly going on repeating this why you are putting yourself into suffering not in this life alone you will be suffering life after life so open your eyes and see where you are going what you are doing the kama krodha lova moha mother and then matsuriya jealousy there's a terrible thing they call all these six of the scenes in the bhagavad-gita bhagavan sri krishna he gave only two words kama asia krodha asia raju gunasamud baba third chapter 37 verse the sri krishna is telling o arjuna we are having two terrible enemies and on the way to spiritual life and way to our happiness the karma and the krodham this is the it is desire and it is anger kama asia krodha asia it is desire and it is anger wherefrom it comes comes out of rajas rajas you know that the same again the three qualities are there the second quality know these as our enemies and all deburring and cause of all seen swami vivekananda he puts this and in a very simple term and he has taken it from the mahabharata mahabharata also says the same thing swamiji puts that mahabharata teachings he says para piden papa what is seen when you are torturing others that is the power how we torture sometimes physically sometimes through the thoughts and sometimes through the words and this three way we torture people all over the world you can see the people will be torturing those who are physically strong they'll be torturing the physically weak people those who are rich will be torturing the poor people those who are intellectuals and educated if they get the chance they will torture the uneducated people any opportunity but they're not that bad because they don't have the discriminative capacity that's why they are doing when we are reading this page of the gospel of krishna in one page we get everything of the spiritual life that's why it is veda and sirama krishna is telling see when he say asked what will happen to this sinner suramar krishna is not giving the direct reply because he said that you have to understand this world this world is nothing but very very temporary and from this world you are not going to get anything actually and if you think that this is the permanent thing and you like to grab it for that the first that desire then if you cannot get then you become angry and you go down and down and you take all your followers that's why friends we should be very very careful those who are doing something wrong whoever he may be even our very close friends and relatives if they are doing something wrong we should not be supporting them we should not be with them helping them anyway because the one who is doing that if you are supporting even psychologically mentally by encouraging them oh it's good good then also you are incurring sin so one must be very very careful very very careful otherwise whatever the good works that we are doing we are taking the holy name of god we are going and helping people and they are doing all good things whatever we are accumulating immediately it goes out used to say to his beloved disciple swami vivekananda you are going on accumulating go on accumulating all the good things so we have to be that way mightily and we should go on doing good things good thoughts helping people praying for the people and those who are doing bad thing telling the lies don't join with them not at all no you like you do but as a friend i should say why not discriminate somebody is doing something out of emotion don't quit that is it doing really good work for the people if not we draw this world is like this we should not get involved into it so very carefully when the girish ghost said what will happen to the sinner the ramakrishna sang a beautiful song to give the reply meditate on the lord the slayer of hell's dire o's don't bother about it what the sinner are doing and what will happen to them you better meditate on god and it is only the god who can help you then i am not reading the whole poem consider o mind why you have come to earth now again the discrimination again the bichara consider oh mind oh my mind why you have come to earth it says your gain is there in evil what gain is there in evil evil thoughts and deeds consider oh my mind why you have come to earth what gain is there in evil thoughts and deeds by meditating long and deep on everlasting lord perform your penance here the penance what is the penance whatever the bad thoughts bad deeds that we have done if we go and sit before the god and say i am sorry o father o mother please forgive me i am weak the please help me by that way if you are praying and meditating on god for a long period of time then slowly slowly the mind also becomes very clean the god's thinking god's thought clears the mind by meditating long and deep on the everlasting lord long and deep by meditating deep meditation means merging with that god and for a long period of time you forget about your body about the mind about the circumstances about this world only thing your beloved god or the goddess is there and you are merged with that that is the way one can purify the mind shankaracharya is also saying that we have to purify our mind many a times we have discussed about this purification of the mind is the mast and how we can purify just thinking about god taking the holy name of god that's why the initiation is very helpful if you take the name but one should be very careful about the person you are choosing as your guru how he is involved sometimes some people just for the sake of the religion they are telling lies collecting font and thinking that i am making the big temple of lord but what is the process how you are taking the money getting the money a religious man should always be on the righteous path if i can can't get the donation or the money can't collect the money well no problem why should i have to construct the temple if the god wills he will send money and in the right way with the right people one should be very careful and if those who are giving the donation to this type of people those who are thinking somehow we will make the temple and whatever the money however it is coming even by cheating people and others way ah the big temple i have made they're fools nothing is happening to god and are as per the bhagavad-gitas but the religious injunctions they're committing scenes only so even after constructing the god's temple each and every moment everything that we do it must be righteous and in a proper way the parapedian papa but no way we should cause the trouble to others the master cells across the sea of life in the twinkling of an eye one attains the vision of god if muhammad steps aside from the door the muhammad you know the conception of the power of god is the maya the word maya and the prefix moha that means the supreme the maya is the power of god what the power of god is doing is only diluting he is covering the truth and superimposing something else on the truth so avarana and big shaper these are the two sanskrit words the vedantin will be going on discussing about that talking about that first is this maha maya or the maya we can say the power of god it's covering what it is covering the truth what is the truth the god the reality the brahman and what it is superimposing on that this chaga this world there's so many varieties of things that we see all are superimposed on that and we think that that is true sometimes i give the example there is a white screen and on the white screen there is focusing so many things the movie a tiger is jumping a man is running a car clashing all these things are going on happening jagat nama rupa different type of things are happening different type of emotions we are then actually on what we see that on that white screen then obviously we have to understand that the white screen is that brahman is that god which is permanent which is always there and all the things that is happening on that over that is nothing but temporary things now we have to understand shall we go for the permanent or for the temporary because it will go and it will again it will vanish then ultimately we are we are thinking of beautiful plant beautiful tree and look at the butterfly coming and sitting on that i must get it i try to grab that i like to have that and if i don't get then i am sorry i am crying we have to understand for what i am crying these are all those things that will go away the other day i saw the photo of three great actresses in one time they were very famous in indian movies now they are elderly but very elegant now they are there they are happy even at this age they are happy and they are enjoying in their life ways but when they were young the people were so much fascinated with them about them they used to for to just to get a glance of their this to go and be crowding over there now everything has gone they've also understood it and the people have also understood those who used to go as a young people to look at those young ladies they have also grown and become old maybe many of them have passed away things have completely changed another group has come again the same thing is happening and this is called maya but we don't understand even though we have seen if we look back and we can see that what at our young age people used to do the same thing another these young groups are doing and what the elderly people are doing these people will do the same thing it's going on repeating every moment moment moment but still we are thinking these are all permanent and this is called maya where from it has come why it is covering our mind the god has done this the god's power the one should pray to god to overcome these otherwise again and again like a man constantly searching water in the desert and runs after the mirages and fall on that and can understand oh i am deceived once again it is not water i only thought it is water again he will say in a little distance another mirage he will start thinking oh this time it may be real let me go again he finds it is mirage the life is going on like this so what should we do we go back to bhagavan si ramakrishna who said it is only god and god is only existing and all these things that we see is nothing but the divine play as long as we are living in this world so long we will go on playing whatever the responsibility we they have given god has given to me but at the same time understanding the truth realizing the truth mentally quietly our mind should go to god and whatever we do we must always give it to god so friends this is the way we have to understand that the god is the only reality anyone can realize god any place any time only we have to discriminate between the reality and the unrealities and after the discrimination we have to give up the unrealities the temporary things and to prepare ourselves for the reality the truth which is joy which is love which is light and how we can do that through work physically mentally and through words never hurting never cheating anyone never causing pain to anyone whether it is in the name of religion or in the name of the nationality language nothing i am not going to do that and that is called spirituality and in that spiritual life slowly slowly one can concentrate the mind on that god for a long period of time and by that way all his scenes all these bad deeds will go away and the six the bad qualities that you also vanish only pure love will be there we will continue the this teachings with bhagavan sirama krishna in our next class thank you let us see if there is any question so the first question is from saneeth of energy the question is we know that human life is full of suffering but how could we accept this very truth that is true that those who are suffering is really really very very difficult but truth is true you know that when they say if say if we think in this way the childhood that was a fun and the parents where their grandparents were there they used to look after us we were so happy let me let me be continue as a child can we no it goes or is changing the change is life the suffering maybe with the some reason but now that we have come to know that all these things is going to go someday whether the suffering or enjoyment let me prepare for the actual real truth and that is god that is the way we have to continue thank you second question is from devashish he's asking in life we come across people who are very selfish and try to take undue advantage for their personal gain and motive is it due to our karma in our past life we come across such people and the second part is how to overcome from such situations and that's true you know the if we take the words of the gita as true they say that yoga breast that those who are praying to god and concentrating their mind on god trying to realize god doing good work thinking good way that after the death they go on a better and better and better places the family and the social conditions are good but from there if by chance the god's grace they go on up towards god again again there's sometimes when these type of challenges come around some bad people come maybe that past life something we have done now very carefully and very intelligent way we have to handle them and to go away from them and constantly praying to god god whatever i have done i am suffering in the company of this bad type of people please remove them please take me away from this situation you will surely get it and that is the only way the next question is from devjanidhar she is asking please explain how to feel that there is god with me even during our heart time up to our acceptance dev journey actually is really true true we can understand you can at a time a very hard time it is very difficult to believe that god is there even bhagavan as swami vivekananda sudama krishna's beloved disciple when he saw the people are suffering children are suffering he shouted towards god what type of god you are so like that why these children should suffer is really unbearable but the truth is truth whether we understand it or not the god is there karma fella the action and its reaction is also there so all things are going in that same way same direction now as because we are reading and listening from the lips of bhagavan si rama krishna who never told a single lie in his life whatever he said is truth and truth and truth only and mas aradhamani devi the wonderful character the divine mother swami vivekananda the exalted power that he was having this is these are all the three they are telling us that we should have to strive god is there and we must pray to god and are you as i was giving the people the answer believing that god is there and it is true we should go on praying it in our difficult times the god i don't know where you are but i have a complete faith on you i like to believe you please relieve me from this trouble i am it is too much for me unbearable pray to divine mother mother i am your child and it has become unbearable for me please help me please guide me and as a monk i can say from the long experiences it really answers and whoever will call me as mother just mother with a sincere heart i cannot refuse that prayer so that is the only way we can proceed thank you friends and once again i am sorry we could not start in the right time because of some technical defects and we are supposed to start this class at 7 30 chicago time now we started it at i think 8 45 something like that sorry for that so let us conclude by altering this mantra to bhagavan's rama krishna mantra and we will conclude [Music] bhakthanuka [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign you
