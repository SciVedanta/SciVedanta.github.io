[141: Panchama Veda 141- The Gospel of Sri RamaKrishna- Part -1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is9-Nf1tcE0)

good evening let us chant this mantra tava Kadam rhythm dr. G venom Co V be rewritten Cosmo sharp 'him seven among Gotham three Magatha tums Bovie grinning PA poori dodging aha we were reading and listening from Raghavan the ramakrishna the discussion was going on whether one person should leave in the household and realize God or he should have to leave the household and then become a monk a recluse to realize God Salameh Krishna says if you are in a household if you're a householder naturally your responsibility is there obviously you have to take all the responsibility of getting into those and at the same time you have to put your mind and soul to God a little difficult but possible but those who can't completely renounce for them it becomes only one option to realize God there is not much other thing to do so that way it is easy for them so to different type of lives now here someone was asking say is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the impersonal God so we discussed in the last time house Rama Tichenor is analyzing and giving the reply so this is the page three 50 of the gospel of ceramic is not so which I have given the name Pancham of Veda so it says is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of impersonal God so those who are attending this class and you mostly know that there are conception to conception personal God impersonal God the God with form and with qualities with epithets and God without anything so obviously we can imagine where there is no images no qualities no epithets nothing is there to concentrate our minds a mind like ours is so difficult so obviously the answer yes there is but the path is extremely difficult I was telling difficult ceramic richness mentioning extremely difficult the stage is only slowly we can reach to that when it's a young person going to attend the school at last grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 slowly he is moving upward and he is realizing understanding analyzing many things is all developing year after year as it was easy when he is in the right age and in the right study in it not to have all those books because it is already there in him for him it is very easy when he is going and attending a lecture by a renowned professor noting down his main points it becomes easy for him but not for a very young mind they need whatever the in the front of them slowly they can concentrate they can learn same way in the spiritual life those who are beginning the spiritual life without any help you can imagine where they will land how they will proceed is so difficult then obviously in a different way not directly but indirectly they are getting the mental support some of the signs they will take and with that help of that sign they are concentrating etcetera maybe sometimes the candle light maybe sometimes this sign that sign different type of of the spiritual and religious the signs are there that way why those things because it helps a human mind to concentrate to conceive that idea Hindus they understood it long long back so obviously they are concentrating in this way that you can develop a relation with God how the God is my mother God is my father God is my friend so different type of relations we can develop that is a unique way it is easy I am cooking for God I am preparing the girl and for God I am offering this thing for to God so in that way my mind goes to God that is the easiest simplest way the ceramic richness is extremely difficult after intense austerities the Rishi's of the olden times realized God as their innermost consciousness and experience the real nature of Brahman though we are be dancing and in Vedanta you are not supposed to take any the help of any images even then the own God so they are giving you an opportunity to concentrate oh mighty Brahma they say is the nearest there are some of the qualities such cheat onon the saruba how is Brahman his existence we understand existence oh this is existing for so many years that is their so existence knowledge we understand to some extent the knowledge and please the joy we understand to some explain the concept of joy the please so this is the way it goes but and as parent cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if his mind is stained with worldliness even in the slightest degree that is very important even in the slightest degree the path of knowledge is very very clean now the world and spirituality the worldly things means temporary worldly things means temptation and along with the temptations the desires anger and along is anger so many other things are all coming constantly we know one of the another we have perfect knowledge about all those things so obviously how he will turn your mind focus to your mind and concentrate on God without any form only consciousness and how is the consciousness no one could explain it to the digests perception of Berkshire aloo Gobi when we understand about myself how I look I go and stand before a meter and look at the meter and I know this is me in this way in this fashion I look so that a conception is there but about the consciousness how is that consciousness a vague idea then when we are conscious we can understand things we can see things we can follow things that's all there's a vague idea what is the consciousness actually that is also you don't know and when a person who be striving to realize God we doubt and form without any qualities obviously that that is very difficult slightest decree of this worldliness the mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form taste smell touch and sound and sometimes many people they concentrate on taste also it's a good tasting and then they will go on concentrating on that particular taste or the smell that particular smell they will concentrate on that smell or a sound most of the people they'll be playing a very soft music before concentration why because taking the help of the music but those who are practicing ganimard path of knowledge even that establish now that you can understand how very very difficult it is only thing to inspire yourself the Shankar Acharya and others they have composed some of the stotras and you are chanting distorter than the bhagavad-gita you are reading the those totals and then you are having some respite something to hold on so can you imagine the mind every human being just imagine that he is sitting in a room where there is nothing not a no color at all just blank no picture no sound nothing is there and he is concentrating his mind so that is the condition there is another kind of Samadhi now the Ramakrishna is giving after explaining that thing you samadhi you'd like to reach over there another kind very easy sometimes it occurred how what is that it's called one mana Samadhi uma√±a is a one attained eight by suddenly gathering the dispersed mind suddenly it sometimes it happened then some people they were talking suddenly someone told hey have you heard there's an accident and you're very near and clear one in that accident he has passed away immediately the shop that comes he forgets everything all around including his own person only oh my god and well his mind goes it doesn't know it is impossible to explain even not in pain it had it been in pain he would have cried out that comes afterwards but anyways the ramakrishna giving an example that this way also people reaches to that condition where mind become 1.8 the question is - mind become 1.4 getting each and everything all these varieties that we see and things that all around us forgetting dad one pointedness that is called someone has given me a one light two type of light that there are military people they use a very powerful light but you can spread the light and you can at the same time concentrate and when you are concentrating that you take just and you become very concentrated light only that particular spot you can focus and it's so strong so in the moment the mind becomes focused naturally become very strong and to focus that you have to add just your mind we draw from all other things that I have done the known people names forms these smell all those things you have to withdraw and that way and it can be suddenly it can happen sometime to some people and that particular position is dug as una mana samadhi mind mana own absent so alumina the completely absent mind suddenly it happens so here it says you understand there what does it mean he's asking the cinema krishna is asking his disciple in yes said yes it is the sudden we draw up the dispersed mind to the idea but that samadhi does not last long worldly thoughts intrude and destroyed yogi splits down from his yoga so suddenly the mind goes over there but as because it is not properly prepared to go there so obviously it cannot remain over there for long when other things are happening around immediately minds come down so that happens and worldly people may now and then experience samadhi many of the people you will hear you'll say I have seen tackle coming in this form Macaulay visualize giving that nothing this is very good instead of seeing only these intact different type of the dreams even if dream which we see taco does good but sometimes we think that is the ultimate no wrong that's because the mind is thinking on the Ramakrishna and the subconscious mind is also it is there so it comes even see that when you are in difficulty particularly fear then maybe the suddenly the images the pictures in dream of your father or mother or someone whom you can depend and used to depend on that dickham and they come and they say oh no problem I am with you except Exeter is actually from the subconscious mind is gone giving us the support it was already there I used to depend on our or him and now that my mind in such a condition it cannot think it cannot have that type of strength to think then certainly we go back to that stage and it comes similarly the God also nothing wrong nothing bad so this is also good but that is not final that one should know in the spiritual level and the spiritual journey but is a little advancement that's all and it gives us interest to we can feel oh this is so nice if I still practice if I still practice then we can go on doing it like this so the Lotus bloom no doubt when the Sun is up but its petal close again when the Sun is covered by a cloud worldly thoughts is the cloud the whenever's other thoughts are coming that is the cloud covering the mind again we forget so sometimes you see that the people who are coming and becoming the monk and the NAM they are practicing and the spiritual life in the beginning they are so sincere they're practicing doing and after some time the forget a little bit away that becomes a almost like a daily routine but that loved that just that de luces that is a dangerous thing because we have come for this particular purpose and then you forget the purpose you are just living like like life like that the complete wastage total wastage so that is the reason Swami Vivekananda see ramakrishna maharaja introduced the selfless service the circular service also observes we cannot keep our mind constantly on the conscious level so that is the reason one should be careful and now ramakrishna mission unified four different paths together that helps only meditation is really really difficult and when you are not getting success you become frustrated and maybe majority of the time people become hypocrite they are not militating but they practice to see it on the and the West scratching position for a long time as the practice only and will be sitting there for a long time and people think is very taking his closed his eyes thinking something else all sleeping whatever is a hypocrisy that is developed because there is no other way he cannot realize God and we don't have that type of love the eagerness to practice is really really challenging for the spiritual people and Ramakrishna mission in the new this is the new introduction and you will see in our symbol all the four yoga's are there and if one sincerely practicing with the faith as because the Ramakrishna said and practiced as because Mara domine the baby Sade and practice Swami Vivekananda say practice and introduced and all the great Souls like the direct disciples of ceramic Islam they have said we have realized that so have faith and practice what at that karma-yoga jnana-yoga ya know yoga bhakti yoga the devotion and then the knowledge and also the surplus work and of course meditation only meditation is very difficult only reading the books and discussing and practicing the path of ghana as a sort of it and there's sometimes some people they prefer to do that they're actually hypnotizing themselves so I am reading the book and that is called so dire so what the ayah means with the faith I am studying rain if you can do that very not that it is not there it is there but very very difficult not only bhagavati Ramakrishna in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna is also telling very difficult and then he is also speaking about the four yoga's if you can do like this - you can't these these these different type of yoga he has introduced shri krishna here the path of knowledge is difficult una manera samadhi sudden realization that is also possible but that won't continue and then he says isn't it possible to develop both Gianna and bhakti the aim master Masha is asking and now all these days up to page 350 he was going on talking about only gana because in those days in the society is to talk about the God without any form which form how God the Supreme God all-pervading God all powerful can be in a small image or in a picture or in a symbol how it is possible so that is why the confusion was there and a group of people different groups also that came up and they were Turing why not in our breeder there is also there that you need not to bother about the image that is also possible so that was the wave it was going on and three ma master Marcia he was also carried by that to him so constantly he was thinking is it not now he is thinking oh as because the master is scaling it is very difficult okay now let that be there in editions of T he is asking this question isn't it possible to develop both Gianna and bhakti by the practice of spiritual discipline then see Rama Krishna is giving the answer through the path of bhakti a man may attain them both he's talking within you have to understand that was the Ramakrishna a great master he could understand the psychology of a person he knew that he is thinking that you will become a good singer or a good scientist or but it's not having that capacity so obviously what will be beneficial that is the Guru Guru knows what is beneficial what is good for the particular person and he is helping him in that way he is a guide spiritual guide and not only that is a realized soul in himself passed through that path so obviously he understood that he is click tailing through the path of bhakti a man may attain game but why master Marja inside it was all bhakti all devotion he wanted to depend on God knowledge means no dependency and that strong mind it was absent in muster mache so he but about swami vivekananda who wanted to become a devotee said no your path is gano and that young Noreen he fought and he said no this is very bad to think that I am God how can that be I am making mistakes I have desire I have so many other things how can we perfect God Saddam okay she used to say but you think you could you a tour to he end and you beyond that anything that you see is nothing but you God you were also saying why don't you follow that he was helping him to follow the path of knowledge whereas is constantly inspiring master Marcia to follow the path of bhakti so master Masha asking this question and he is telling it is possible through bhakti you can get he is not feeling through gana you can develop through bhakti gana is also come and he said a highly-qualified aspire and may develop gold Gianna and buppie at the same time highly qualified aspirant a desires to realize God and what is that quality knowledge and devotion together then he is giving such is the case with the issuer forty he should a koti again is the classification of the devotees the students were seriously following the path of spirituality and Ashura koti is the highest issuer means god and they belong to that particular category of God so he sure got it dear thinking their capacity mental strain clearness mental thing everything is so different Shaitan Jana for example check the new Mahaprabhu so naturally we can understand but the case of ordinary devotees it is then he said there are five kinds of light the light of a lamp but is also light that's also dispersing the darkness that also helps you to see things but it is a small little life only illuminating a little area that's all light of a land and light of various kinds of fire sometimes small fire something big fire that's also light it is also eliminating the area it helps to see things and light of the moon you can see all things in the world in the light of Moon but not as clear as in the light of Sun so he says the light of Sun is very clear lastly the combined light of Sun and the moon that means D and nine twenty-four hours you were illumined bhakti is the light of the moon gianna is the light of the Sun the true fifty maybe there is a little mist maybe that it is not that clear as in the daytime but you can see and very comfortable so in the daytime your mind is sometimes we see God jealous God but constantly it will be enlightened it'll never going to be Dirk I mean the dianna sometimes it comes it is so bright the bhakti and Jana we can we can think of that condition of Shri Krishna when he was giving that gita about Gita he was going on giving the advice to that Arjuna because that was a crucial time very critical time origin was the main hero basing on whom Shri Krishna the Lord the God he made everything now suddenly that very person the Arjuna he was confused he was thinking whether I will fight or not whether I will take the other qualities like the brahmanas baking and leaving some of them all here the Krishna that God he gave the light of Gita that's just like the Sun very bright very clear afterwards Arjuna himself admitted not to move Ozma till of DA that Prasad odd Maya cheetah he a tutor I have muha moo-ha means that delusion so that has been gone and and understood the truth what I should do now I'm here then the war and all those things was over they won the battle and after that one day once again he was it be asking the krishna to repeat can you please repeat those things that was wonderful but I have forgotten some of the teachings of yours he said I cannot repeat that because he was connected with that particular position of mine the god himself that he was revealing but it came down but does it mean the Krishna lost that knowledge no it was there in the Ramakrishna in all our dollars it is the moon and the Sun he will wonder a tribal peep group in or najin Kadesh they worship Dhoni polo they're also Sun God and one God day and light constantly God is present there will be not a single moment when God is not there the wonderful conception the Sun God and Moon God don't need Polo so this is the thing the ceramic is nestling and then it says bhakti is the light of the moon it is also light but very comfortable light and Jana is the light of the Sun today morning I went out Shammi Venetian and the from Germany came in the morning we wanted to have a walk up to the bit first I thought it's okay and someone told in America you must have the sunlight is necessary acceptor so I went out but it was impossible after almost fifteen twenty twenty minutes I was compared to come inside the still burning it was there but in the night when does the moonlit night is there and you feel very very in terms to walk in the moonlit night as long as you were there no harm no problem there is also like that also you you can see you can enjoy everything but that is the property that is the devotion and it says in an incarnation of God one sees at the same time the Sun of knowledge and the moon of God the indication serum of his names of those who were observing Salam o Krishna very closely those who could he could realize that is not an ordinary person though apparently he looks like a or very ordinary it talks in a very simple way but he is not maybe when he goes and stands before a very highly knowledgeable person like Coshocton Dechaine and other pundits they were actually educated learning people in the spirituality and the religion they were nowhere and he used to tell them those things in such a soft and nice way not that this to feel insulted rather they got benefit of that knowledge the knowledge became perfect with the help of the Ramakrishna and that is the reason flama business to go and see anywhere anyone sincerely trying immediately Salaam Pistons to go what we have to help them and in that way in their own way used to tell why don't you do like this this would be acting beneficial for you as some people major give the people they liked it they could not defeat him in argument a man who never attended any school a man who never read the scripture but he himself was the be the source of knowledge and we are reading the books and then memorizing it and then we are going and trying to teach people arguing but he source was himself so that is the reason afterwards Shami be vague on the road odd though adductor some are he to teach them Rosella bhakti but are with the rhythm his mind inside that was the ghana knowledge but apparently bhakti he is running to the mother Macaulay he is also going and crying and praying to Krishna and he is all going and worshipping Shiva he is going and taking the holy dip in the Ganga he's traveling to different holy places on pilgrimage and he is going and trying to listen to the discourses of the different early mein all this thing's devotion but the moment it comes immediately that knowledge any mistake they are doing no it is not like this it should be like that he started when he was very young he went to see how the people are making the images of gods and audiences and the sculpture east in the villages and he saw when they are making the eyes it will know this is not the eyes of the gods or goddesses it should be like this he himself drew that it should be very compassionate most of the cases we see the Hindus they know when they are making the image that is Goddess Durga Kali they make it in a ferocious way as if the that mother is very angry from the eye exactly as if the fire is coming out no that is all that even the eyes is very compassionate and when is looking at the devotee and his creation his children how the mother can be angry he's she's so compassionate looking at her creation of children and she is helping them all so that we see is all you know the Hindu the Hinduism is very very symbolic all the things they are helping them to go beyond ignorance so cutting not killing them but destroying their ignorance that is the idea so naturally the eyes should be very full of compassion so here say Ramakrishna is telling can everyone by mere wish develop knowledge and love at the same time it's not so easy but it is possible to obtain God's grace just like that ordinary people we are trying to realize God majority of us we don't have that clear idea conception of religion what is religion we do not know majority of us majority we considered miracle as religion we considered super power as a religion if I say that I will do it for you I will cure all this medicines are not necessary I will look at you and cure all your diseases all people will run for you is a religious man you're wrong religion has nothing to do it all those things only giving the clear direction about the realization of the self of the God which is completely different from the body completely separated from the worldly things name beam all the things are not at all connected with that so many of the people they will go and pour lots of gold and other jewelry's they'll be giving to the God whether other human being suffering just in front of the temples they are sitting begging immerse Allah food they will never look at them wrong conception so this is the thing the first and foremost and Serano krishna when he said the aim stood silent because we can understand just one or two things that he is mentioning him means the master Basha and he's very courteous very gentle he is not mentioning in details but we can understand how he was thinking shall I have to give up the path of Yana shall I have to follow the path of bhakti but I do not know how to practice bhakti it is not very natural with me I rather can discriminate a rather can read books try to understand social I have to give up the knowledge and go for the book P or I will stick to knowledge only what shall I do because he's guru is telling like that so he a little in in a very difficult situation stood silent master to remain silent usually the wrong case now let's try to explain here is not why is giving the opportunity to this devotee his disciple to ponder over to think over clearly what path he should take this is the thing if you follow this path you are going in this way and this if you are going you are following in this way after that is silent you choose so it was going on in the different type of other discussions are going if they were having and I come to page 352 where see Ramakrishna is telling master moshai I shall have to tell you something of the six enters the mind of the yogi passes through these and he realizes God through His grace have you heard of the six centers why suddenly Ramakrishna talking about that I just skipping those things passages he is master ma che after this the last conversation that you are then he went into a deep jungle with Ramakrishna practise meditation no one ever visited that that was a full of bushes and jungle that was a bell tree was also there he is to go and see Ramakrishna's to go and meditate but as a very difficult place master Marche after that conversation when Saddam o Krishna mentioned that you have to practice a lot then only so that night without going to bail he went into that Salam o Krishna Ramakrishna gazed there something is going on so after some time he came to that place found him out consoled him and he was telling you're practicing meditation okay I will tell you about the six centers the six centers of the yogi yogi two yoga practices most of the people now it is all over the world because the yoga has become so popular they all know about it mooladhara swadishthana Manipuri Anitha wishes a gotcha chakra these are the six centers and it's the the power that they say that goes up one after another and different type of flowers as if hooked enough it's all yogic not that the doctor can operate and find it out no so he was talking about that and suddenly master Masha as because his to practice Gyana yoga instead of referring about the yoga master Masha is referring about the Gianna he said these are the seven planes of the big answer majority of us we do not know what are the seven place of the vedanta but see ramakrishna immediately correcting him rectifying not the vedanta but the vedas so correct those who are following the path of ghana they know there are again as in seven stages of yoga the seven stages of jana is also beard and you will find even in the lord buddha's teachings eight stages of guiana etcetera etcetera are there so this is the old old tradition they always give all those things in five or three or seven or eight like this type of numbers only this much that you have to follow but it's specific but in that one and is all there so here the seven stages of Jana what are those let us follow that it says sub-tab omigod where the sub to whom occurs means seven stages of the development spiritual development of the Omegas the seven stages of the development of the wisdom are described in the bra who punishes sosamma Krishna said Veda he narrated badonk badonk is a different term completely the beta me is all-inclusive even the Upanishads bara who vanishes acceptor all come under the wager see so specific and we think as something we have said is almost like that not almost specific it says also need augur arcs Lord reboot this a reboot Nagada dialog is there he says the Revo about the jeevan mukthi that is gana you know when you are when a person is living in that condition he is totally free from all bondage --is that is the highest thing that always the those who are practicing the gana Marga their goal is to become Jeevan Mukta after the death when you are free of the body after false and when you're dead then you are going you are free that is the different thing and here it says Jeevan Muktha you are living in this world but not bound by anything Shankar Acharya say said the human word is only meant for that Jeevan Mukti suka property eight away Jen Midori Tom white is janma by the human birth only to enjoy this freedom while leaving after death it is different while I am leaving let me enjoy this that is the ultimate of the Gianna Margie's what are those first is to bed cha will find the Lord with the tour because he followed only Reda so from here only he took and he changed those things serve H a good desire fast and foremost thing in the Jan amalga you have to have a good desire what is that good desire I want to know Who am I in reality I am leaving I am thinking the same type of thing many others are also doing even the different types of animals birds creatures are also doing is there no difference who are mine to be Chara so su hey cha echar it remains desired super good so good desire what is a good disease to know myself then richer or non which are on a bechara the which are not inquiry who am i where from a by calm when my body is changing mind is changing is that everything is changing in that fashion if mind is changing body is changing who is observing these changes as because if there is nothing permanent we cannot understand the changes that is very common knowledge so hui what is that which is static permanent comparing with which we can understand that my body is changing mind is changing so that is called which are enquire tonu mana see Donna wanna see pertaining to the clean mind mind the mana now it is so slowly slowly the mind is withdrawing from all the objects different ever objects we know first is that we can see that is Rupa Russia shop the sparsa ganda that means the smell of the the form beauty and we see and then we hear without you smell and all the things slowly slowly I am withdrawing so that is called Tana wanna see - no mana see Donna means is becoming thin a person is not eating food what will happen to his body slowly slowly he will lose the weight he'll become lean and thin similarly if the mind is not feeding and the outside objects it will become lean and thin so that is the practice pertaining to the tea in mind then set the path the attainment of the soft wash of the gunas we know all good qualities a soft one loving others caring for others doing things helping others without expecting money or respect or recognition I just help so all these things are soft well but that comes in the mind let me do that ossama Shakti the non attachment attachment non attachment these are all common again and again we are studying those who are studying the indian philosophy again and again they say non attachment so this is non attachment will come then padartha Havanna padartha is object Bhavana analysis now I think if I am NOT getting these I cannot survive is it true the padartha the object if it is not there I cannot survive how it is there are so many people without that they are surviving how they are surviving so when you think like that all anxiety goes so that is the reason ultimately we have to redraw our mind and completely concentrate on our the prayer thing that we want to realize the obvious the padartha Bhuvana that is very very important there is a Six stage and finally come to year three amines goes beyond the final stage and just to explain that to dia in this way phase in the very ghost level it's called visual all the viscera be sure that we say which remains the universe whatever in the universe that we see in the milky way down to the grass everything is nothing but visual there is a rose and then subtle the terminology they say pages are three juicer as the Sanskrit term in term that means the same thing in a circle form anything that is gross is there it has a subtle form is also there and then comes in a BJ BJ means very circle but the root from where it comes that is called prog Kia and then finally Turia going beyond all these three stages this not gross is not subtle it's not even the seed like then what is it to do so they have given the name - dia that is the stage only you have to go you were to read you have to realize and then only you will know otherwise it is impossible so the visa the seven stages see Rama Krishna said it was again the Friday December 21 1883 the master Marcia is noting and giving an account but it it is very small account and he said that after his midday meal the master went to the punch Abbate wearing a beautiful yolo row two or three positionable monks were there clad in the grace of the effect most of the Vaishnava they wear the yellow robe cinema Krishna put on that yellow and went over there and he was talking with them mixing with them about the Vaishnava name that this is immediately after the lunch the noontime afternoon among belonging to the sect of Nanak arrived there's so many different type of people so he was the leaving Parliament of religion different type of people they are coming to him from different signal different faiths and he was worshipping of the formless god Sudama Krishna asked him to meditate as well on God with form look at it the man he was practicing the Nanak upon T the none of the means now they have become completely separated as a different they cause sheikh religion this nanak upon t the guru nanak he was sitting and be actually propagated same God without fall why again because of the Muslim and afterwards the British the Christian influences so it is a to some extent it was confusing so that okay we also believe that God is without form so Nana they also say the ok so this is the non urgent Islamic Eastern is advising him to meditate wit for that else as we were discussing a little earlier we were discussing that it helps us the master said to him died deal one does not get the precious gems by merely floating on the surface God is without form no doubt but he also has formed by meditating on God with for one speedily occurs devotion then one can meditate on the formless god it is like throwing a later away after learning its content and then setting out to follow his instruction in another place also he is mentioning someone wrote a letter it was misplaced and the person who wrote is an important man person for that particular family so the head of the family was oriented if I don't follow whatever he has mentioned written or wanted it will be difficult then she was early then suddenly someone found that later he brought it and he found her to three things that gentleman who wrote asking for he memorized those three thing and then through that later today is over the similarly first thing you have to realize God with form develop concentration with form and then develop the devotion with form then through that go-to without form disease the roundish this is the uniqueness majority of the people either are or is not and they always say without form but that is the only thing you are to follow if not do belong to us career and with firm also only with form and that too is one particular wall if not Gary but Saddam Oh Krishna that is the uniqueness and straw me Vivekananda on the basis of these after observing all these qualities much afterwards he wrote about our every style is the barista the supreme the highest why look at this this non as Ponte never belonged to say Ramakrishna's idlers unity was practicing in different ways but he was sincere so Salaam o Krishna waiting to over there out of his own and he was as being the wish numbers he was helping the non upon thieves then it is a account of the Saturday December 22nd 1883 different devotees came a devotee said how does one obtain love for God those who were regularly listening to the gospel of cinema Krishna regularly reading you know Salam o Krishna gave the answer previously he will also give the answer again but the person when he is asking this question it seems that he was casual not very thing there to listen to the answer and to follow that cinema Krishna who could understand the mind of people he understood that he is not that since he had to know it so he said go forward the king dwells beyond the seven gates you can see him only after passing through the gates the seven gates shocked Abu me and just now we were reading there in that gianna yoga also that the seven the seven gates one after another you were crossing in fear now unnecessarily asking these and then you are not practice see Ramakrishna never wanted to waste the time she understood that whoever whatever you are practicing practice practicing clearly he will reach you will understand and then he is telling God sports in the world as man that man is talking about the God and the God standing before him he is telling giving the hint God plays sports in the world as man he Internet's himself as man as in the case of Krishna Rama Chaitanya he is not mentioning about his name he is giving the hint but majority of us we do not understand we think that God means miracles we think that God means we are free from death also no problem will come including death will be ternal not like that so that is the reason see Ramakrishna sterling the man in the form of man God comes how you will know it's full of knowledge rule of law is no doubt at all but an outer of doubt is clear in his conception and full of love full of compassion if you belong to us then I will help you if you don't belong to us then you go away I am NOT going to help you that can never be a religious person the moment you are discriminating you are not a religious person but you are helping them supporting them
