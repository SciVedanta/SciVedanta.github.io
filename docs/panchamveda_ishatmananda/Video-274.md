[275. Panchama Veda 275 : The State Of No Separation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9BufOR0ubc)

dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be reading from the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna the panchama veda and before that we will chant from this as usual we do [Music] friends we were reading uh that particular portion where bhagavan srirama krishna is visiting the star theater enjoying the theater and conversing with the girish chandra ghosh particularly and other devotees and in our last class in our last discussion we have already discussed that particular thing bhagavan sinam krishna i'm just repeating over here as a song in english consider o mind why you have come to earth what gain is there in evil thoughts and deeds your way lies not through these perform your penance here by meditating long and deep on the everlasting lord long and deep meditation can purify the mind and what is the meditation the concentrating the mind on one object and that bhagavan surama krishna is suggesting the lord lord means the god whatever the name we can think of the form we can think of but we have to concentrate our mind and what we should do we should be completely mind should be free mind should be pure no thought should cross evil thoughts and deeds sometimes for little gain little name and fame the people they go mad and do so many wrong things those who are conscious those who got the blessings of god will be aware and should not do that the master cell across the sea of life in the twinkling of an eye one attains the vision of god if muhammad steps aside from the door the last time we read from here this portion then he is going on telling while worshipping god one should assume a definite attitude i have three attitudes the attitude of a child the attitude of a mad servant and the attitude of a friend then the con this this portion we have already read so i am not touching it the girish the he confessed when sirama krishna mentioned the attitude of a hero is not good some people cherish it they regard themselves as purusa and women as prakriti so that is not good bhagavan sinama krishna is mentioning and girish is guideless is totally devoted to bhagavan sri ramakrishna so he's telling the truth that sudama krishna appreciated no hypocrisy he's telling at one time i too cherished the idea that i am the purusa and the prakriti and all that siddhana krishna looked at girish painsively because girish whatever he has done is not at all good because the karma follower the sirama krishna the giver of the karmapala he looked at girish and master mahashaya he noticed it that sudama krishna is not at all happy rather a very the father as when he sees the sun is not doing good that pain see way he was looking then he said to girish girish i still have the twist in my mind tell me what should i do greece is asking sirama krishna sudama krishna reflected a minute and said give god your power of attorney let him do whatever he likes this is a very special advice to girish and very few people can truly do it why suramar krishna said girish to give the complete attorney to god and the let god do whatever he likes the attorney we know that i give the power of attorney to someone and now i don't do anything that person whom i have given the power of attorney will be taking care of all the cases all my things then now i am giving the power of attorney to god and god will take care so only the person who is completely faithful and open so he only can do it otherwise majority of the people will say i depend on god i give the whole thing to god but again he will do something no the hypocrisy is not there that they'll be apparently they'll be saying something but in reality they'll be doing something else this hypocrisy in the spiritual life in the spiritual world completely that destroyed the whole thing the surama krishna the great master he's the great teacher so he is guiding the disciples in this way and he said to girish he understood that what will be the good for giddish you give the power of attorney to god the conversation then turned to sramakrishna's young devotees when he was looking at the girish and he found that girish himself declared that i have done all this the sudama krishna is now helping girish to overcome all those things because he has understood that that those things were not good for him now he wants to start a spiritual journey from here itself by surrendering the whole mind at the feet of god i am not going to do anything because i won't be able to do oh god please take care of myself so this the girish is telling now surama krishna is talking about his young disciples this young disciple means the narendra not the rakhal baburam that afterwards they became all great sannyasins of the ramakrishna order they formed the ramakrishna order this vivekananda brahmana the turian and the ramakrishnan and the sardananda all this they it's about them srama krishna is talking in meditation i see the inner traits of these youngsters they have no thought of acquiring house and property so two things are there i always say one is god another is the world and if we go to god then we have to give up the world the surama krishna is mentioning that the house and property that means the world they don't have any desire for those things so naturally is mind going to god the truth is that unless a man has got reed of rajas and has acquired sattva he cannot steadily dwell in god he cannot love god and realize him so sometimes some people they'll be doubting whether god is there or not some people will be saying oh this is not the way to realize god and why i tried so long but nothing has happened it's very clear it's like the mathematics if you are following these steps you are getting the result and what are the things that a god say you cannot love god why because if you have the rajas and what is the raja's ego and what the ego does i will do it i will do that i should go there i should say this i should acquire this i am the master that means we go back to that ego the arm god the ahamkara is the cause of all bondage it comes from where from muhammad that deludes us the the the one we call ahamkara i that is nothing but the reflection of the pure consciousness that is the vedanta is very clear about it the com reflection of the pure consciousness on our the buddhi and that we are thinking i am that and going on telling these and that this is what suramar krishna is telling you cannot you have to overcome the satwa and what is sattva god is doing everything that i am surviving is not that really miracle everywhere so many people for so many reasons they are suffering dying but still we are there something must be there that i should do that is that is the reason i am still leaving so i must do that i must understand that and what is that good too the all people the living people the living gods and goddesses and by that that way by thinking and physically doing i'm purifying my mind that is the sattva now i should do and then i should acquire i should get the benefit i should have everything that is the raja and through the raja tama is also overpowering and ultimately we are suffering we have seen in a great lives this suffering but still we don't learn the sirama krishna in every page in his gospel is indicating that teaching us that reminding us that we should be careful girish you have blessed me so usually what happened the greeks there oh my god that will be very difficult then he is telling you have blessed me now he is trying to get the help of the master then the master is telling how is that i said that you'd succeed if you were sincere you'll be successful if you are sincere what is the sincerity believing in the existence of god first trying to realize god following the path of bhagavan sirama krishna what is the path of sigurama krishna that you had to dedicate yourself like a child with a great faith the god is your mother god is your father and going and praying to god constantly requesting him to take care of you and never even forgetting that i am the child of god so that is srama krishna's way anyone anywhere anytime can do it the more and more we are sincere in every moment we will think oh god is there at a time of getting up i will look at the picture of god god new day is beginning in my life please be with me then every say a few hours whatever i am going to do i take the look at the god's picture and say i'm going to do this mentally we are always connected with the god whatever we like to do even cooking even doing the personal thing i'm like to go i'm going to do this so i'm connected with the god i'm remembering the god i'm not forgetting the god then ultimately in the night when you i'm going to go to bed i am retiring then i will go to god and say now i am going to sleep and whatever the work by thought by my words and physically i have done i give it to you god please receive it and i don't want anything else please give me the devotion at your holy feed god will never forget because we are not forgetting him how can he forget us in the bhagavad-gita also bhagavan sri krishna is mentioning like this the surama krishna is telling that and he's telling saying these the master exclaimed ananda mae or the mother full of the police ananda the police is a obviously about the mother so anandamai about the mother and we know he used to worship goddess kali so we can imagine that he was remembering the goddess kali the sudama krishnas if we notice every time after the little conversation these and that immediately goes back to the mother his go goes back to that then sometimes he'll say mother sometimes anandamayi sometimes rama sometimes some other way that is the teaching in his own way he is teaching us whatever we are doing we must always remember god we should not forget it so this is the way what is happening purifying our mind what is the purification detaching the mind from the worldly objects and putting the mind at the feet of the god or taking the holy name of god remembering god that is the purification that is the austerity and he is telling the bliss of sachidananda is indeed good but what about the bliss of divine inability sachidananda that means merging with the god merging with the consciousness but i am the am with the god and i am the witness or i am present when all god is doing his divine performance that is also the joy the great joy the salaam krishna indicating two different one way the devotees the dwellers they want to go and live with the god and be a part of his play divine play but the gyanis they don't want that they like to go and merge with that god the consciousness it is not even the god is the consciousness the surama krishna says there are two different ways but those who like to enjoy the life it should be like this then he's singing once for all this time i have thoroughly understood from one who knows it well i have learned the secret of bhava it is a bengali song again he sang why should i go to ganga or gaya or kashi or kanchi or these are all very holy places the holy river because all the hindus they go to this the pilgrim centers they always visit that but the devotee is singing he is saying why should i go to this place to these holy places i am going to purify myself when by taking the name of god all the time sitting in my room i am purified why should i have to go to ganga for bathing to become the pure i'm already pure how i have taken the name of god it is not the physically that one can become pure i can go and all the time sit under the water of the ganga but all the filth is there in my body and at the same time if the bad thoughts connected with the physically physical thoughts are there in my mind how can i say that i am pure even every day if i am bathing in the ganga or jamuna or godavari or whatever pure rivers are there it depends on the mind it is the mind that binds us and also get the liberation give the liberation why them thought and that thought sudama krishna is telling i don't need to go to all the holy places because i am taking the name of the pure god's name why should i go to ganga or gaya or kashi or so long as i can breathe my last with the kali's name upon my lips kali kali kali bole or japa jodi bapurai i am not doing it it is automatically coming only kali kali kali kali the kali that that famous pure name of the goddess when i am repeating constantly even the unconscious mind is also repeating i am fully purified i need not to go to any holy places gaya this is a beautiful song the master continued while praying to the divine mother i said o mother i don't seek anything else give me only pure love for thee that is the highest prayer i want love for god that's a great prayer sometimes some people the devotees they like to know they will be calling me or something writing the swamiji bhagavatam krishna asks to pray only for the pure love but i like to pray for my son i like to pray for my children is that the same i said no why because the god is our father god is our mother where shall we go as a father as a mother i have my responsibility for my children i am trying my best to give them good education and trying to give them protection comfort everything so that they can grow up the best human being but at the same time i want the blessings of god too so naturally one can go to god and pray nachiketa when he went to the god of the death the first prayer was for his father and mother parents second prayer was for the betterment of the whole world third prayer was i like to know who am i so there's a greatest answer there when i continuously feel that i have the responsibility to look after the family so obviously i should pray to god for the protection for the well-being of my family no harm in it but then of course i should have to take a second step and then pray for the each and every one that's why in the way that they teach us that service the greatest prayer that only the broad-minded hindus could think praying for each and everyone i don't know many people maybe they don't like me maybe they are enemies even then i am praying and that is called the spiritual path no hatred no jealousy only i believe that god has created this world and in his creation because he wanted because he liked the good people and bad people i don't care about that that is god is playing so he has asked some people to act as a villain they are doing that and some people are good people they are doing that so that way i am praying for each and every one servants let all people be happy and their miseries the difficulties be removed oh god please do it by that way my mind is purified and the third will be lord i like to know you i like to know myself this way we can step by step go towards the god when sudama krishna this moment he is giving us the highest form of prayer it doesn't mean that we cannot pray for our comfort pray for other worldly things at this moment this world is very very real to me at this moment oh god what should i do and naturally i am praying to you please give me this second i have understood that you have given me given me all the protection all the comfort now i like to pray to you god all around me people are suffering please help them remove their suffering and then finally by the grace of god when i reach to that height then when i can really really feel the pains and sufferings of all the people and then i go and understand oh these are all the gods in the in his creation is all divine play then i should say god enough is enough whatever way you like to handle this world you do i like to go to you let me know who am i and who are you and what is our relation that is the third prayer was pleased with girish calm mood the girish was in a very calm mood sram krishna liked it and he said to him this mood of yours is good the calm mood is best then after the theater the actresses following girish instruction came to the room to salute sirama krishna was in the in the in the manager's room in the start theater he was sitting over there the play was over now the actresses actors they all came they are offering pranam to bhagavan sri ramakrishna they bowed before him friends i like to mention and many of you know in those days this actresses they were very much looked down upon the days to like the the people is to consider them very low status so naturally the neighbor used to talk to them or go near them that is to get people but sirama krishna the god himself with all his devotees before everyone that's why he's god the moment we make the differentiation that they are not good they are not that way pure that i am making the difference and when there is the differentiation my understanding about the religion is still limited i have to understand much better way and far away to go to understand that and here we are talking about suramar krishna not only he is telling that each and everything is nothing but the god as the rishis of the old in vedanta in veda they realized it sarvam khalidam brahma each and everything is nothing but that consciousness sudama krishna in the modern age he has also realized that he is aware of it and that he is showing in his behavior what he is thinking what he is teaching telling that he is also behaving the same way but that is called true religion many people may give great sermons but do they follow that no so this we have to understand that they don't do that so that is why suramar krishna is great because whatever he thought he said he did too all these ladies are coming whom the people is to shun in those society siddhana krishna is blessing them they're coming and take bowing down and then some they are touching his feet also master mashay noticed it the salama krishna was the purity personified so if something is happening the impure thought impure thing comes so naturally the purity that we can we can think that white like the milk even a drop of ink black ink will immediately people will notice that there is a drop of black ink salama krishna's mind was like that these ladies suramar krishna never criticized them rather he was blessing them but still in reality their thoughts were all body centric so obviously that never matched with bhagavad-gita so when some of them that with thinking that ramakrishna will be happy touched his feet master masha is writing he said to them very tenderly though it was really unbearable for him but even then he said very tenderly please don't do that mother calling them as a mother don't do that but that is the condition now some people may say why why you should not notice no question of why when your mind level is like that suppose a great singer he's sitting over there and someone is playing a wrong tune he will suffer other people for them it is okay but the perfect singer a little mistake in the tuning it should be comal it should be soft it should be hard different things are there i don't know much of that so the singers the musicians they will suffer oh that if you look at their expression the unbearable pain they feel only sound for us it is okay because we don't understand that exactly the bhagavan siddham krishna also we have to understand him like that he was a perfect tune a little changes that gives pain to him but still he considered and blessed them now the master mashay the carriage came the sudama krishna is going to dakshinesha master moshe now recording the date was saturday december 27 1884. we were reading from the pages of the gospel of krishna the 82 836 82 683 now today on the page 683 this date saturday december 27 1884 it was the christmas season taking advantage of the holiday many devotees came to the temple garden to visit the master some of them arriving in the morning among these were kedar ram nittogopal tarak surendra em sarada prasanya and the member of young devotees and a member of young devotees this was sarada prasanna's first visit master to aim where is bankim haven't you brought him with you now this is not the bankim chandra chatter party the famous writer no this is a young boy the student of the master master and srama krishna liked him because his mind was very clear mind so he told bring him over here before the impressions of the worldly things come i like to guide him teach him so the human is nothing but the mind if your thoughts are broad-minded you are a good person if your thoughts are all self-centric they're not a bad person this is the difference so if sudama krishna noticing this the very pure-minded young boys he used to tell them to guide them and that is necessary at this age to give them the proper understanding that this is the world and this is the real path that you will get the peace maybe by cheating and by doing these and that you'll earn little extra money and what type of comfort you want what type of food you will eat what the rich people are eating nothing so this is the way we have to understand the they go and they spend so much of money just to stay only one person and living in a huge huge hotel room or apartment or whatever the building and in the indian currency equivalent to one crore can you imagine part day one crow maybe a whole village in india they will survive on that and much less than what that money one person is spending and what comfort how much he or she will eat but still so this is the way the sadama krishna is guiding us you like comfort okay you have earned money of course but at the same time don't exaggerate the whole thing rather utilize that ma money for the betterment of others then what will happen this life you are enjoying the good deeds that you did in the past life and you have forgotten about your future life the future life also you have to think that's why the hindus and the buddhists they always talk about the karmapala the joins this is very very important today i am enjoying because i did some good thing in the past and now just because i got the opportunity i'm misutilizing it misusing it then obviously it will be the cause of suffering in my future the swami vivekananda said you are the maker of your own destiny we blame but it is we create our own destiny so here sirama krishna is talking about bankim that young boy master marsha is immediately explaining because there's a confusion about the bankim chandra and this young boy bankim and he said bankim was a school boy whom siram krishna had met in bhagbajar noticing him even from a distance the master had said that he was a fine boy that was the special you know sudama krishna could read the mind after a while sudama krishna waned to the panchapati with the devotees they surrounded him some sitting and some standing he was seated on the cement platform around the tree facing the southwest he asked with a smile have you brought the book aim said yes sir master read a little to me now the devotees were eager to know the name of the book and we are here too you know what the book suramar krishna asked him to read that was a novel written by bankim chandra chatter but they're very famous and they name was name of the book devi choudhurani those who can understand the bengali you can read that book it's a beautiful book and mainly spirituality and also patriotism the mixed into that bankimchandra was a patriot so and he wanted to get the freedom from the clutches of the british but he was serving under the british he was a magistrate but within his own heart the within his heart it was there and so he used to think that if this type of thing happened then how it will be but his base was spirituality and also mingled with the patriotism and i we will suramar krishna will be listening from that book here he is telling the devotee where devotees were eager to know the name of the book it was called debi chaudhurani the master had heard that the book dealt with moti plays action why suramar krishna is interested in this book because he heard the bankim chandra chattipada the great writer and the great the scholar he has written this book on the basis of karma yoga people discussed about that motive less action he had also heard of the great renown of the author bankim whom he had made some days before and he wanted to gaze the author's mind from the book master mercha is trying to understand why is ramakrishna is interested to know about this book aim said now he is reading from the book a young girl heroine fell into the hands of a robber named bhavani bhavani patak her name had been prapulla but the robber changed it to devi chodurani at heart bhavani was a good man he made prapulla go through many spiritual disciplines he also taught her how to perform selfless action how now here is the difference he robbed wicked people and with that money fade the poor and helpless so that is the method idea is good but the method is wrong the robbing of the wealth from the rich people and then feeding feeding is good but the robbing is not good the method is not good he said to prabhullah i chastise the wicked and protect the virtuous surama krishna has a small comment he's meeting making but that is king's duty a king is supposed to do that he should control the the bad people and protect the weak people in his of the country in his kingdom aim in one place the author writes of bhakti bhavani patak sent a girl named nishi to keep prapulla company nishi was full of piety and looked on krishna as her husband prafulla was already married she had lost her father and lived with her mother the neighbors had created a scandal about her character and avoided her and so her father-in-law had not allowed her to leave with his son latter has husband had married again but the profiler was extremely devoted to her husband so this is the the story goes in this way unnecessarily people not knowing actually what they are doing they will go on assuming someone will give a statement unnecessarily not knowing properly and that ruined the life of the person particularly the girls the ladies the bad names the rumors now this girl was nowhere the father passed away only the widow mother they were not that way very rich how to protect them now she was going somewhere is the he was she was caught by the robber now our life is changing the two sudama krishna now said you can follow the story m is reading nishi i am a daughter of bhavani patak he is my father he has also in a way given me in marriage prafulla what do you mean nishi i have surrendered my all to krishna prabhullah how is that nishi my beauty my youth and soul prophet then he is your husband nishi yes because he alone is my husband who completely possessed me prafullah with a shy i do not know you took that you talk that way because you do not know what a husband is if you had a real husband you could never have liked shri krishna now the nishi is talking about the sri krishna thinking the shri krishna is her husband that is the way of doing the devotion but the prefuller now knew so she is not understanding that the foolish brageshwar now that writer is rajesher was the husband of the prabhullah papulla's husband was unaware that his wife loved him so much nishi all can love sri krishna because he has infinite beauty infinite youth and infinite splendor this young lady was a disciple of bhavani pathak and well versed in logic but prafulla was illiterate she could not answer nishi's arguments but the writers of the hindu social laws knew the reply god is infinite no doubt but one cannot keep the infinite in the small cage of the heart one can do so only with the finite therefore the infinite creator of the universe is worshiped by the hindu in the cage of his heart as sri krishna the finite personal god the husband of a woman has a still more definite form therefore if the wife cherishes pure conjugal love the husband becomes the first step towards god hence the husband is the only deity to the hindu women orthodox societies are inferior sorry other societies are inferior to hindu society in this respect prafulla was an ignorant girl she could not understand nishi's argument she said friend i do not understand all these arguments but you haven't yet told me your name nishi bhavani patek has given me the name of nishi knight i am a sister of diva day one day i shall introduce my sister to you let me continue what i was saying god alone is the real husband and to a woman the husband is our only god sri krishna is the god of all why should you cherish two deities two gods if you divide the little bhakti of this small heart how little there will be so the prafulla she is a new girl and getting training and the nishi and deeba they were greatly trained by that as the story goes by the bhavani party though he is a descarte but he was slowly slowly forming a group who will go and fight against the britishers etc so that is slowly it is developing the master martial is reading from the beginning so prafulla don't be silly is there any limit to a woman's bhakti nishi there is no end to a woman's love but bhakti is one thing and love another summarizing part of the book aim said that bhavani initiated prapulla into spiritual life he continued reading during the first year bhavani did not allow any man to enter papulla's house nor did he allow heart to speak to any man outside the house so this is another brahmacharya that we practice this is uh the same way a boy is not supposed to talk to the girls and ladies and the young lady trying to become sadie trying to become a brahmacharyani should not talk to the men so that is the training is going on then afterwards aim then read that prafulla the study of the scriptures that they finished grammar and read rohu bamsha kumar sambhaba in the sanskrit stories and she studied a little of samkhya vedanta and nai phila zafi do you know what this means master now commenting people like the author of people like the author of this book believe that knowledge is impossible without the study of books so that is mainly most of the people they will be understand thinking in this way and that is the reason the monks are not supposed to disclose their past life why you know the moment they come to know the devotees come to know that he was a student of such and such university and this is his these background that background immediately they start thinking we must be a great uh knowledgeable person but all these subjects that we study in the colleges and universities has nothing to do with the spirituality spirituality completely different thing sudama krishna never attended in any school masharada muni devi never could read any book but look at the depth of their wisdom the spiritual knowledge so that is srama krishna is mentioning here mankind jandra chatterjee was not that way the spiritual we can say the personality he was a very good writer and he was a good administrator he was a patriarch and a very strong hindu faith all those things were there but even then spirituality is completely different thing sirama krishna pointing out this do you know what that mean people like the author of this book believe that knowledge is impossible without the study of books they think that first comes the knowledge of books and then comes the knowledge of god in order to know god one must read books but if i want to know now cerama krishna in his own way giving the example if i like to know a rich man then here he is quoting the name jodhu malik must i first know the number of his houses and the amount of money he has in government securities do i really need all this information rather i should somehow enter his house and then if i want to know about his wealth or possession i shall only have to ask him about them then it will be very easy matter for me first comes rama then he is riches that is the universe this is why balmiki repeated the name maura the balmiki he could not pronounce the word that says rama but as because he was a decoy he used to kill people so maura that means the dead person so that he could say that mara means dead person so ma means the god ra means the world so he went on ma ra rama so afterwards so sirama krishna is telling this and this is the truth what we learn from here is this that some people are trying to give the spirituality means doing something good if necessary by cheating others robbing others and with that money if you construct a temple then all your sin will wash away no not at all it's a wrong conception wrong idea even sometimes you know that in our country we have seen and in the villages particularly some people they are good people but they are early morning they will get up and go and they will plug the flowers from others garden here in america it is not but i have seen i don't know of course i have not seen here but i should not give the statement of the whole america but the places i have lived in america i have not noticed that all the flowers are there beautifully decorated all over the streets roads and nothing no problem is there but this is what actually we feel that constantly the mainly our people they go and pluck the the flowers from the others garden and then they will offer it at the feet of their own god now that is also not good this also i am not taking the permission of the owner of the flower tree so i am not supposed to take flower from there that conscience if it is not there then how can i realize god the god is the truth god cannot accept anything that is not truth suramar krishna let me remind it to you and also to me srama krishna used to take the jews of one lemon just one lemon and it was arranged the permission was taken from the owner of a tree you know lemon means hundreds and thousands producing in one tree so that one a total one lemon you like to take every day no problem please take it so he gave the permission the one person is to go pluck one lemon bring and that sudama krishna used to take the juice of that lemon lemon juice now one day he couldn't do that he wanted to squeeze but not a drop fell then he was wondering what is the matter same lemon from the same tree immediately he said something has happened maybe the owner has changed i have not taken permission from the new owner so it is a theft without taking the permission of the owner i have taken the lemon please go and inquire and if it is the new owner ask his permission then only i can eat this this is called truthfulness this is the high standard of spirituality a little bit of morality little bit of other things that superficially we talk about love and then we are all one that is all base the la truthfulness that comes from within that completely you in such a way unknowingly also you cannot do anything which is not truth and that was revealed the person that sold that particularly plot that particular plot to another person so obviously the tree now belong to the new owner assalamu krishna told go and take the permission of the new owner if he also allows then bring that so this is the story and when's ramakrishna talk about the truth we should remember this he was a perfect manifestation of the truth even unknowingly also he could not do anything wrong and that is spirituality sirama krishna is talking about this the devotee listened to the master's word with wrapped attention ana aim continued reading of the story of the prabhullah and this is a big way it goes the friends i will mention it in in the in my next class then i am skipping the and going to page number 687 the cerama krishna is telling it is the pure mind that perceives god it is the pure mind a mind that has the slightest trace of attachment to the world cannot be called pure so what is purity and impurity thought about the worldly things what about what are the worldly things anything that is temporary anything that is temporary are the worldly things and which is permanent only god only the atman only the brahman whatever name we call it this is telling then he said pure mind and pure atman are the same and it goes like this leela is by no means the last word passing through all these states i say to the divine mother mother in the states there is separation give me a state where there is no separation but today we wanted to talk about and then next class we will discuss about no separation and in the bhagavad-gita also bhagavan sri krishna is talking about that smarata nitya if we are going on remembering god constantly i am not forgetting god this is the most important thing in the spiritual life since bhagavan srirama krishna is praying to the divine mother give me a state a condition in other conditions separations are there but give me a condition where there is no separation thank you friends and any question you want to talk about the retreat uh afterwards after this um is asking how do we spend our life by depending on god depending on god means you know just taking the name of god for everything because we are beginners so obviously i can't see god as the surama krishna is to see so obviously we have to believe and we have to go on taking the name of god as a there is a confusion when there is a confusion what we are supposed to do then it says in the mahabharata you should observe the life of great person and follow the steps of the great person so naturally here the greatest personality is bhagavan ramakrishna he's telling god is there god is all around you so right these moment we should go on talking to god say god father or mother these are the things that is coming to me and i am thinking that i should solve this problem or perform this work like this way please bless me and help me this way constant connection with the god touch with the god for each and everything and that way slowly slowly one day we can feel that he is responding that is the only way the second question is from srimad vishwas she is asking why people tell lies why people tell lies you know that because of our past karma it's very very very difficult to stick to the truth very difficult even in some of the songs as a shri krishna as a playing with the mother when the mother told a who has eaten this milk and this milk product and the baby that small kid he's telling my nahi mark on a cow you know that song the mayan he mark on the cow he's spontaneous so now that is okay with the the baby's children they are doing it but slowly slowly when we are growing up intentionally for our benefit when you are telling the lies in the nowadays it has become too much you know as i was observing uh in the in the newspapers a group of people because of the software development a group of people simply uh giving this picture and giving another news mixing up and spreading it a lot of rumors and going on even the people the great people the leaders are also thoroughly confused which one is corrected which is not i don't know why they're doing it what is the benefit that by this way just to grab some power they're breaking the backbone of our culture that is truthfulness i the truthfulness the first and foremost of the king's word i have given the world i may die but i am i'll never go back from that so that's why this should be that they're breaking the backbone of our culture that is truthfulness i don't know how to stop it and to answer your question in one line i can say because of the selfish motives self-interest they tell the lies thank you friends let us now conclude over here by chanting this pranam mantra niranjanam [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music]
