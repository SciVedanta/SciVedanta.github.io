[290. Panchama Veda 290 - Apply the knowledge of Brahman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtenhfQZyI0)

namaskar their devotees and friends the wednesday evening and we'll be discussing about the panchama veda reading and a bit discussion so let us begin as usual with this mantra name we were reading from the chapter the master and narendra so we will be reading from the page 7 1 0 17. there was a king who used to listen daily to a pundit's exposition of the bhagavata master is discussing with the devotees narendra was there the why the the name of this particular chapter has been given master and narendra i think the sudama krishna is giving extra attention to this young man narendra so he is telling in this way the worldly people attest to with the worldly objects and worldly things they cannot completely dedicate to the spiritual life and cannot realize the god actually there are two things one is god another the creation if the if you go to god you have to leave the creation and if you go for the creation god's creation this world then there is no chance of realizing god so that is the main thing the srama krishna is mentioning in this way a man wanted to engage a pundit who could explain bhagavata to him why bhagavata because bhagavata is a very popular scripture and usually the the mainly that our veda and the upanishads they were read and discussed by some sannyasins scholars bhagavata was for each and everyone so mainly the tenth skanda of the bhagavata which is the biographer life of sri krishna we can say so the bhagavata so he wanted to listen from bhagavata his friend said i know of an excellent pandit but there is one difficulty he does a great deal of farming now one who is going to explain the bhagavata and if he is engaged in the worldly things so that is he is mentioning in this way he has four plow and eight bullocks and he's always busy with them he has no leisure there upon the man said who wanted to engage the pandit i don't care for a pundit who has so who has no leisure to study to meditate and what to talk about the expounding then krishna mentioning continuing on the same thing there was a king who is to listen daily to upon this exposition of the bhagavatam every day at the end of their study the pundit would ask the king o king have you understood what i have read to this christian the king would daily give the same reply sir you had better understand it first yourself so king he knew the whole thing now who is reading the bhagavata he is reading only to please the king and to get some money from him so when he is telling have you understood it the king in reply is telling you better understand better there correctly each day when the pundit returned home he would ponder the meaning of the king's words he was a pious man devoted to prayer and meditation gradually he it came to his senses and realized that the real thing in the world is the lotus feet of god and that all else is illusory he felt dispassion for the world and took up the life of a monk now god and his creation if you in the bhagavata it will give both that is our choice if we go to the to the world his creation we can enjoy for some time but most of the time it will be the miserable and we go on experiencing that misery then one day we can understand we are trying to find out the joy the peace the happiness but this is not the place so that is what bhagavan si rama krishna is mentioning then you have to go towards the god temporary enjoyment some name and fame and your ego is bushed up ego is hand it's okay then this world is okay for you but if you go for the permanent happiness joy peace and know again and again coming and taking the birth and then suffering and dying if you can understand that if you have realized that then the way that is you have to dispassion as he was leaving the world he sent a man to the king with the message yes o king now i have understood through these two now naren has come naren is sitting before him nor in in his life the changes are coming he is facing the terrible poverty he is thinking that he should earn some money to support his mother his brother and sister his family at the same time he is realizing that the futility of this world so he was such a nice teacher you can understand his understanding was so clear even then when he was he was appointed as a teacher in a school with the sugar daughter's husband his son-in-law he made a false acquisition against the narendra because he was so popular teacher and this man couldn't and accept that so with the false accusion and biddashagar never inquired because the son-in-law is telling he accepted that and naren was fired he had to leave their job he realized this world slowly through his experiences then the friends and all others when he was a rich man son all these people were with him now that all his relatives were also so good at that time when his father passed away when there was no support and his own father's brother uncle he took away all the property they were in a great difficulty the young man of only 23 22 23 and he was thinking what to do and what not to do he never thought about all this we can understand that is the situation at the same time the master master will mention that something happened in his life and he realized the futility of this world and he wanted to renounce so that is why sirama krishna is giving so much of attention to this young boy and only to give him the hint this is a world is like this if you want permanent peace joy happiness if you want to be merging with that eternity then you have to renounce so he's telling the story but at the same time he is telling i do not look down on worldly people but do i look down on the worldly people of course not suramar krishna is asking this question at the same time giving the answer now here also the indication that you need not to think that the whole world everything is rotten this temporary if the people are happy with the temporary things it is okay like the children they are very happy when they're playing with the dolls and the toys it's okay for them we should not snatch those out of the children hands of the children oh these are dolls and these are all temporary you should not play with this that will be very the unthinking way working no it is not that it should be that people who like to enjoy this world let them enjoy and when they are there are we going to criticize them hate them not at all that is exactly what sudama krishna is telling and then he's using a wonderful phrase he said i apply the knowledge of brahman the oneness of existence the brahman itself has become everything all are narayana himself brahman at the same time he used the word narayana the duality the god now when we read the bhagavata we find that this same thing it is in the bhagavata it says those who are following the path of knowledge they say their goal is brahman those who are following the path of duality they say their goal is bhagavan those who are practicing yoga they say it is paramatma all three are the same in the bhagavata it is very clearly mentioned that is why bhagavan si ramakrishna is mentioning the brahman and the narayana so when he is mentioning like this he is giving the indication the hint that we have to live in this world and the world will always remain like this and we cannot all the time hate but if you apply the viewpoint of the advaita that everything is nothing but the consciousness in different names and forms i am not going to hate them but my purpose is to realize the brahman that i should do alas i find no customers who want anything better than the kalai pals and the kalai pulse in the one type of pulses that with that paste they prepare one type of sweet the the cover is good but inside it is only that cheap the pulse the people they like it ordinary people because it is cheap they can afford so they like it but the taste is not that good so this that is the why he is mentioning alas i find no customers who want anything better than kalai pulse no one wants to give up last and gold the desire desire desire and to satisfy the desired wealth so this is going on on and on and on there are so many people every time in every era you'll find they're cheating the thousands of people millions of people just to become rich in the in the 15th 16th century the kings they used to do like that they will be sending out the descartes and the pirates and with that money half portion the king will get by that way they used to become the great king barons and all that so and in our countries also the landlords that there was no rain people could not the ordinary people couldn't develop the any cultivation was not there how they can pay the taxes but that on anything that they will go and beat them and snatch away everything the little thing that they were having all of you europe and asia if you see that is the picture why last and gold even today if you look at there are is going on in the same way the last and goal so if that the last and goal is the final thing then what will happen misery ultimately you you cannot get joy the happiness and you cannot people will never remember you with great respect they will hate you all through but still then the desire is so people cannot control so that is called worldly people man deluded by the beauty of women and the power of money forgives god but to one who has seen the beauty of god even the position of brahma the creator seems insignificant the beauty of god here they say that when we see that beauty of the external beauty of something we get attracted but if we can imagine the one who has created this beauty how beautiful he will be so the god's beauty after the realization of the god whoever has realized him in whatever way they are all so happy apparently it looks so ordinary because they are not having any that way or the heart and home or social status or money majority of them they were apparently very ordinary people in this world and depending on the alms they'll be going to house to house for begging for their food and people oh the ordinary man whether he can't work he's living only on our health but that man was so happy within the years after years you'll be closing his eyes and enjoying and when he's moving wherever he is going to whomever he is talking with they are all very happy so that shows the happiness that happiness is god and it seems insignificant because the brahma the firstborn the creator even that position become insignificant if the god comes and says do you want me or the position of the brahma and the real person he will say i want you god a man said to ravana you have been going to sita in different disguises why don't you go to her in the form of rama but ravana replied so this is how sirama krishna is putting it shita was abducted by ravana and ravana wanted to tempt her he was not forcing so that is the good thing that we and is going on in a different forms he will go ravana maybe the shita was afraid to see that form so ravana will give in different form rashida could understand that this is ravana again so she used to refuse when shita refused ravana will come back and this was going on maybe some of his other ministers were telling like this but don't you gain the go in the form of rama if you go in the form of rama shita will accept you then the rabbana is telling when i meditate on rama in my heart the most beautiful woman celestial medal like the ramba and trilothama appear no better than ashes of the funeral pyre then even the position of brahma appears trivial to me not to speak of the beauty of another man's wife so ravana he was a devotee of sri rama chandra vishnu and he knew the rama is nothing but vishnu only to get liberation quickly he was practicing in this that way that is the one type of the practice spiritual practice making the god his enemy that is also there in the sastra you can meditate on god or you can try to realize god by thinking that he is your enemy as there are they have suggested that you can think god as your son as your friend as you or as your master like that also the rabbana practice that way that is dangerous that is terrible but at the same time is very on a very short time you will get the liberation so he is to meditate on sri ramachandra allah i find that all the customers here seek worthless kalai pulse unless the soul is pure it cannot have the genuine love of god unless the soul is pure here's the soul means jivatma the the atman is always pure but when it mentioned different in meaning that same what has been used when the soul is pure means there is no desire for the worldly things that is purity there is no desire for the worldly things the purity and impurity again and again it comes in the in the spiritual life in all the religions they will be discussing in this way only purity and spiritual and impurity and in different way they explain but one thing is very clear if you are thinking about the worldly objects like to enjoy the worldly objects then your mind is impure but if your mind is pure then you are thinking only about the god and he says unless the soul is pure it cannot have genuine love of god and single-minded devotion to the ideal the mind wanders away to various objects friends this is actually the core of hindu religion the hindu religion they do they of course follow so many varieties thousands of varieties rituals but it is only apparent different type of things are happening those who are looking at that they can't reach to the core of the hinduism and the hinduism says the god is the only existence and god is not two it is one and everything has been manifested to the god from the god so that is the core of hinduism and it says unless and until you are renouncing giving up the desire for the worldly objects you cannot get the please of that god if we say god or the brahman so that is the core so what on all other things that we do reading the scripture visiting the holy places fasting and also performing different type of rituals if you go to india or search in indian culture there's so many varieties will be there hundreds and thousands of varieties of the way they are practicing but at the same time the ultimate goal is you have to take a decision god or his creation if you take up the creation you have to wait for the realization of the god a little little joy a temporary joy you have to be satisfied with that and a lot of miseries and a lot of effort all those things will drag you again and again and there will be no rest in it but if you take the god in the beginning you have to have a good fight with your own mind because the nature the prakrti the maya it will drag you down to those worldly things if you can somehow give up that now enough i have understood it i know what is this world i have seen the grandfather grandmother mother father all my relatives every day someone is passing i have seen it i know that i too am going to die enough is enough i constructed the huge building thinking in every room there will be my children and my grandchildren the whole house will be vibrated with all their the words and there will be big kitchen will so many dreams now it has become a terrible thing in that big building i am alone leaving no one around so these are the ways you have to judge you have to understand and you have to go on telling enough my mind give it up give it up if you even don't give a give up then the prakrti one day will take you out and your soul will be taken out and it will go to another body and then from that body you won't be getting the access to your property that you have accumulated in this life this really terrible thing so this is the way if you think then it becomes easy to give up whatever is necessary for my this life i will keep and slowly slowly i will distribute and when the ultimate the day will come my mind will be completely free from everything my ego will vanish and then no desire will be there except one god i want to see you please reveal thyself before me so that is the way one should get ready how can a man living in the midst of lost and gold realize god it is very hard for him to lead an unattached life then it says in this way and slowly he sudama krishna now giving another story we don't know whether it was there in the history or not just you know different stories they come and they utilize these stories to give a spiritual teaching when akbar was emperor of delhi they leave the hermit in a heart in the forest that is the story the akbar is a very famous the king in indian history so many people visited the holy man one time he felt a great desire to entertain his visitors but how could he do so without money so he decided to go to the emperor for help for the gate of to get the akbar for the gate of akbar's palace was always open to holy men the hermit entered the palace while the emperor was at his daily devotions and took a seat in a corner of the room he heard the emperor conclude his worship with the prayer oh god give me money give me reaches and so on and so forth when the hermit heart this he was about to leave the prayer hall but the emperor signed to him to wait when the prayer was over akbar said to him you came to see me how is it that you were about to live without saying anything to me your majesty need not trouble yourself about it answered the hermit i must leave now when the emperor insisted the hermit said many people visit my heart and so i came here to ask you for some money then said the akbar why were you going away without speaking to me the hermit replied i found that you two were a beggar you too prayed to god for money and the riches there upon i said to myself why should i beg of a beggar if i must beg let me beg of god this is the beautiful way the srama krishna is telling that hermit was not asking money for himself he wanted to develop another maybe a food kitchen so that the people who are visiting them he could give some the food to them that is always the the holy people they always want to serve the people like that way but to know any heart that the akbar himself is asking for money and the property then the he told it is better to ask god there is a beautiful song very decent song that is the song some famous singer he sang the dhata the giver is only rama who else will give you so if you have to ask anything you must go to god most of the time when the devotees they come with the prayer we always say you better go directly to god and sit before the in the shrine sit before that picture and talk to god tell him tell the mother also that these are the things are happening in my life in my family and i want your guidance i want your help what to do they are like the father and the mother if you go and talk to them your prayer will be naturally answered if it is good that things will be all right for you the prayers will be answered have faith so that is the god if you go and ask god i am doing this and i need some money so that is the teaching if you want anything better go to god than to anyone else narendra nowadays he is tell narendra is telling nowadays girish ghost thinks of nothing but spiritual things now those who are attending this class and reading with me this gospel you know the suramar krishna the last time he read mentioned the girish is a worldly person and he did all those worldly things so naturally realization of god is difficult for him and that sudama krishna he was god so naturally he told the truth on the face of girish also grisha was heart but at the same time greece had great respect for sudama krishna and faith he asked is it possible that i i'll become pure that he used that uh uh the the way that if you put the garlic uh the garlic paste so that that container will be naturally having the smell of the garlic so by that way he mentioned the girish has done so many things in the world so naturally in his mind those will be there and those pure-hearted people the young people those who never experience this worldly thing should not go there should not have those ideas the mind will be clean so that is the ramakrishna's idea but the narendra used to go to girish because girish was a very intellectual person and not even was very intelligent he wanted to have some discussions you cannot always talk and get satisfaction talking with the people who is not having that type of intellectual level so naren used to go to girish to have that type of discussion suramar krishna came to know about this and sudama krishna said it is better not to go it is very difficult the once it is the smell comes of the garlic is very difficult to go away with that indication of the worldliness so naren was keeping that in mind now when all these things were going on he suddenly mentioned this nowadays girish goes thinks of nothing but spiritual things noradin was also very sincere so naren used to go to girish only to discuss about different type of spiritual thing so he mentioned master like a mother protecting her child the sudama krishna is telling this is very good why why is he so abusive why does he use such vulgar language to me in my present state of mind i cannot bear such rudeness when a thunderbolt strikes near a house the heavy things inside the house are not much affected but the window pan pains rattle nowadays i cannot bear such roughness a man living on the plane of shatwa cannot bear noise and uproar that is why greedy was sent away it was the divine mother who sent him away during the last part of his day he went to extremes he became very rough and abusive to narendra do you agree with girish about me now he suramar krishna is a great teacher he could understand the psychology of the narendra so directly he is not mentioning that you should not go over there rather indirectly the moment you directly say no there's naturally ev action and the reaction comes so he is giving the hint that he is very abusive type of person and he uses very vulgar languages against me too that is true sram krishna used to love grist chandra very much but sudama krishna is loving to girish and trying to help him to become pure and realizing god that is a different thing but if a another person in norwich going to such people and they discuss with them their mind will be colored there's a possibility sometimes here also in america is a free country you can say like this when the novices come we always say it is better for you to be little alone otherwise what happened the different type of people they come when they see the novice and particularly american boys they will be going and talking they themselves have not realized anything they are bogged down in that worldly but still they will talk about the spirituality mostly just book reading and some discussion and they will go on referring oh he's a very good speaker and that type of books are better this is that there's a great sage was there so like this this new boy who has come to learn something and he get his minds get scattered and sometimes the when they go and talk with other people also that happens that's why this is our experiences the new recruits are coming new boys are coming and they are when the different type of influences they cannot resist it and in america naturally they are very open to those things they will be talking with them debating with them and by that way their mind will be colored they'll be and those people will be referring different type of books and journals and talks lectures by that way the mind gets completely scattered and after some time they feel oh this is not my path they go away unfortunate it needs to follow minimum 10 years in the first we are carrying the load of our previous births so we are already overburdened with that the different type of desires are there misunderstandings are there and then in this life also when we are coming to the spiritual life mostly after 24 25 30. so naturally this in this life also so many experiences so many things we have heard and rhaegar learned in the newspapers and all the going on pouring this type of news it's very difficult to get those things refined and take the original thing so this that's why they say you should be completely from the worldly objects at minimum 10 years so when you get settled in that then you come out talk with people mix with people and you hear read listen you your idea is clear so there will be no problem your ship will sell your boat will sell properly here also sadama krishna is trying to protect the narendra he's not criticizing girish he loved girish so much he appreciated girish but at the same time this is the idea now he is asking narendra do you the do you agree with girish what he says about me narendra he said he believed you to be an incarnation of god i didn't say anything in answer to these remarks this is a remarks narendra said because he was not sure about it they look at these the young man narendra will become vivekananda afterwards that this narendra he said is girish remark that you are an incarnation i didn't give any other reply to that so this is the the master but how great his faith is don't you think so sirama krishna wanted to get the reply from narendra so that is rubbish i don't think that should be so the but not my devotees listen intently to the master's words you are still seated on the mat sprayed on the floor with him by his side and narendra in front of him devotees were sitting around a few minutes silence he said to narendra tenderly now very directly he is giving the instruction my child you will not attain god without renouncing lost and gold this is very clear my child you will not attain god without renouncing lost and gold so that if you want the realization you have to renounce and how you can renounce sadam krishna himself suggested the sannyasins externally and internally and for the householders internally externally they are having but there is no connection completely detached way they should leave so that is the wonderful teaching so stating to him as he said the great emotion welled up in his heart fixing a narendra an armist and tender look he sang the master mashay here i like to read this the note that has been given by the publisher the narendra this this was very critical period in narendra's life this is not the master mashay that he recorded it is not but the our publisher is mentioning giving this after his father's death he had been faced with extreme poverty friends and relatives had proved indifferent or treacherous his rational mind could not reconcile the existence of human misery with the mercy of god a few days before his meeting with the master on his way home almost exhausted after a futile search for a job he had sat down on the open porch of a house by the street waiting for the shower of rain to pass there he had received a revelation in which he had found the solution of all the conflicts problem conflicting problems the revelation that that happened the wonderful that means there sitting over there he solved the problem he had felt refreshed realizing the unreality of the world and had determined to become a monk at once so he had come to see ramakrishna the master to take leave of him but had not told him of his intention yet nothing could be hidden from sri ramakrishna hence he sang now sirama krishna indirectly giving the hint that this is very clear that young narendra decided to become a monk then and there he only came just to take touch touch the holy feet of bhagavan's rama krishna and then he will leave sudama krishna realized that he is going to leave so he is singing we are afraid to speak and yet we are afraid to keep still in bengali the song is katha means fear we are afraid we are afraid to speak and yet we are afraid to keep still our minds o radha have believed that we are about to lose you understood that he is going to leave and he was a very strong mind that young man so if he becomes a monk wandering monks and goes away sirama krishna he was thinking he should become a monk but not now he should fast experience and go under the training then only he will he should become a monk without the training proper training and clear understanding about the monastic life if one becomes mong it is a confusion all through in his life and he brings down the ideology too the one should be very very careful before becoming a monk so sudama krishna is telling hinting he seem to be afraid list narendra should leave him narendra looked at the master with tears in his eyes this is the first time that we've listened we hear we read narendra is crying the tears in his eyes is looking at the master a visitor who was there for the first time heard and saw all this he said to the master so this is very funny sir if one must renounce lost and gold then what shall a householder do now those who are with sudama krishna narendra and they they were knowing actually what is happening this fellow he never knew what is there he was a new visitor when he heard the sudama krishna is singing that song narendra is crying and the things were in that mood suddenly he is telling if everybody they give up the world then what will happen to this this world the master is telling here you may enjoy lost and gold what has passed between us is no concern of yours so this is very clear adi khadi adigari means if a person is not ready to realize god when his mind is still full with the hankering for the name fame and worldly comforts then for him these teachings are not necessary he will understand this rather he'll misunderstand that is okay for them but for narendra who understood it realized it a revelation came within him for him completely different that's why sirama krishna is telling that this is our in between us you may enjoy lost and gold what has passed between us is no concern of yours mahima charan a householder devotee heard everything and sat speechless mahima charan he was also a devotee but he used to feel that renunciation is not necessary you know the many of the religion they don't believe that one should become a monk there are many uh spiritual faiths are also there they don't believe that they think one should become a householder have them uh have the wife or the husband and like this like that this monastic idea is completely different in the catholic the church then the catholic christianity is there hinduism it is there buddhism it is there a majority they don't believe in it the protestant christians didn't believe in monastic life the muslims they don't believe in monastic life and the the many are the other people also they don't believe it is only so obviously it's a very rare type of thing the living in the world but not of the world not getting their attention uh the attraction all those things that is completely different type of mentality they are very special type of people and this is because of their past karma the sudama krishna is giving that mahima charan though he used to all the time advocates that people should marry etc mahima's the here we find this the mahima charan he is talking about the told sudama christian many times but here he is quietly sitting master to mahima mahima charan go forward push on you will discover the forest of sandalwood go farther and you will find the silver mine go further still and you'll see the gold mine do not stop there go forward and you will reach the mines of rubies and diamonds therefore i say go forward now upanishad there is a word character and that word has been used in many places the cerama krishna is telling go forward march forward when i took church over here in the chicago that was the march 4th the someone afterwards i have forgotten who and very nicely he put that word the swamiji now it is time for you to march forward march 4th to march forward so that is the way the march forward we have to constantly go on mahima he has read lot of scriptures those who are reading the gospel of krishna you have seen them many times sudama krishna asking him to quote from different scripture and immediately all the memorized he's quoting and singing and and then chanting suramar krishna was very fond of him but the mahima charan had the idea that people everyone should become householder now when he heard these saw this the house ramakrishna is teaching narendra he became grave he was thinking sirama krishna advised him to go forward you have reached a lot but unless and until you give up the world mentally you cannot realize god blessed are those who are pure in heart for they shall see god jesus said it is oft coated but what is that purity no desire for the worldly objects then mahima but said something holds us back we cannot move something holds that back the hold us back means our responsibilities so we are committed to so many things so obviously we cannot do that master with the smiles ramakrishna is the smile why cut the reins cut them with the sword of god's name the shackles of color time are cut by kali's name that means you have to judge you have to discriminate and slowly slowly you have to detest yourselves the many of our devotees have found that they are there they have their children the grandchildren but slowly slowly they are withdrawing that much attention is not there attachment is not there love is there concern is there they go to them talk to them take care of them pray for them but not the way that without them they will die no not that attachment so that is because they could understand the teachings of suramar krishna as he is telling to mahima charan cut them slowly with the bichara time will come when you will die and you have to go from this world where will be your so-called family do you think they will all die without you no nothing will happen to them they will live their life if we judge in that way how much important i am without me that everything is going to stop nothing we only think that the without us nothing will move it is nothing like that that's why swami vivekananda say to the monks think yourself blessed that you have been chosen for the job but the work don't think you are the only person that you can do no nothing like that anyone can do if the blessings of god is there about about the worldly attachments when i was not born this family were there when i will die this family will be there so if we think in this way then the detachment will come then this rama krishna is talking with every now and then master cast his gracious look on narendra he said have you now become the experienced physician so suddenly when he is telling like this that there is a reference unless we understand the reference we won't understand why suddenly narendra has nothing to do with the medical physician here it says quoting a sanskrit verse he said there is a funny way it says that then if you have killed 100 people then you will be considered as a void that means you have to gain experience and sahasrara means thousand when you have killed while giving the treatment one thousand people then you are a chikitsuka that means you are a very experienced person quoting that surama krishna is hinting to narendra whose age was hardly 22 years and he said have you experienced this world then he said was the master hinting the narendra even though still young had had many painful experiences of life nor in the smile and kept silent he understood it but he never gave any answer friends we will conclude over here and we will try to mem remember what sirama krishna is teaching the sirama krishna is saying in this way that you have to give up the worldly attachment when you are in the world already in the household householders life then you should give up mentally understanding the futility of this world understanding that the life is short understanding that everything will be all right even you are not there then you should give up so that is the preparation and those who are fresh young mind not very much attached with the worldly things for them ramakrishna is telling that don't get attached to this that means the decision is ours if we go for the world they'll be god won't be with us and if we go for the god which is eternal evil blissful in the beginning it is very difficult to realize but if we continue we drawing all our senses from the saints objects living in this world and but not getting attached to these then ultimately it will be a great experience of realization of the god it is possible god realization is possible thank you friends it's a there's a question there's one question the first question is from biryandra he's asking a question has been in my mind time and again loitering in my mind what is this advaita bhava how is it different from advaitha and waiter ah see this is a completely different question and say in a completely different three different philosophy and that ramanujacharia who propounded the vishishta dweeta they in a very natural very simple way we can say advaita means they believe there is only one existence and no two or three a vishishta advaita is a qualified if there's some specialty what is that i am different but i am part of it so advaitha never believed about the part so it is only one it never became two and it cannot become two so that is the advaita no two bishishta advaita say now again i am repeating i am part of that one i believe in one but we the jebus at the part of that like the fire and the sparks when the fire is burning there will be hundreds and thousands of sparks
