[32. Panchama Veda 32: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R38eKo2-wS4)

to answer asking means you are shisha giving the answer means I am guru and guru seat is always higher than the shisha so you have to give me a higher seat seat where I will see it and from below you have to ask me the question with folded entities as is the tradition of the spirituality of the religion in that tradition you have to ask me the question the king was so curious to know the answer he said okay I am getting down over there where you were standing now you come and sit in my throne and tell me the answer and this man went the servant he went and SAT and he took his lifted his legs and said we were there like the traditional gurus sweating over there on the throne everybody was thinking about how come his seat over there and but the new king got down folded hands and say please reply where is God show me he said ok but bring a bucket full of water and a packet of salt he brought and he said mix the salt so the salt was mixed in the water then he said where is the salt show me how can you show it is in that down water yes it is on the top water yes left side right side this side that said every where is the sword but why can't you show it to me because it is mixed only you have to test then only you will realize otherwise not then this person say same answer about the God God is all-pervading everywhere only you have to realize in this case as you have to test the water too understand the salt as salt is everywhere but you cannot see it you can have you can taste it can understand it similarly God is everywhere only thing you have to realize it everyone was convinced the king was okay my second answer in which way god looks which is the side to east west not where he said closed all the doors and windows make the room Dirk when it was done he said done light a candle then he said which side is the light is everywhere similarly God looks at a time everything the king was taken aback how could he then the last question what is the power of God show me then he said open all the doors and windows since I want to call your Minister I think that he should come and give this last answer to you to give you the respect and he was sitting over there the people went and called the Minister Minister came he was trembling he was thinking that the fool has made some mistake and both of us going to be beheaded he came and from the main door he saw he is sitting on the throne and the key is standing over there in the court heard and with the folded hand he thought oh my god what he has done both of us today is going to die and he became so exhausted he sat on the chair of the guard the person who usually guard the door on his chair he sat then this servant told look Kim you're the so respected intelligent the minister he is sitting on the chair of a servant guard you the powerful king of the disk kingdom standing over there folded and and I am an ordinary servant sitting on this throne so God can do anything he likes so everybody liked this idea and this is in very simple form true story the God can do anything but to understand God we need a living person and that is the reason God Himself comes in the form of Avatara we find here yet obaachan ebert aunty a problem honest assa ha the see Bassam mijita it says in the pony shot also almost the same sloka is there but the Sri Bassam heater is telling the God cannot be expressed through words no one can do it the god is these god is that so many people they try in that way unnecessary because they won't no one can do it because he's so vast no one can do it yet to bacha what you means the word new burton they come back up r appear without gating Minos's aha along with the mind as he the my mind and my words they went to in search of God and now coming back dejected they couldn't do even the mind so subtle that also that mind also could not get any idea of God so mind and the words are coming back Bart sada not a milonga onam science protein that ruvim it is true true sadhana through penance through austerity through prayer through sincerity if you make your mind pure then God Himself itself will reveal in your mind that is sure so that she was a meat ax is telling and we find that the winda our bday sugar is asking and has God given special power to someone then the Salam o Krishna is telling why we have come to see you have you grown too hard on your head then why we have come so many hundreds of people are there in Calcutta and we have come all the way from dakshina sure to see you to meet you to talk to you and for that we had taken the appointment why because the manifestation of God in you and that's why you are having so much of knowledge so much of compassion so much of love so much of sympathy for the ordinary people suffering people and do you think it is your power no it is the power of God manifesting to you that's why people are attracted to you so here he said this vagabond he comes and who is this vagabond and we find here they are giving a description a definition of gabon would put tincture Benassi am j bhutan arm agatha yoga team BTW victim a bit diamo sabaha Raghavan et he is God so he or eat is God who who is having the knowledge with and vanassa about the creation and dissolution of all beings he's having that idea he is having that knowledge it's just simple to him we do not know what is going to happen what will happen so constantly we go go on dreaming and the dream only goes on pushing us to go and the forward forward and forward at a  end of our life is you all know nothing we could achieve so here but bogof on the god he knows everything other one serum krishna he knew everything before his birth and when he was a child and afterwards everything he knew what is going to happen what will happen everything and wind all his mother and his elder brother they were secretly searching for a match a girl for him so that he can marry now he is practicing austerity and in india always every time religion means you have to practice brahmacharya otherwise so naturally they were thinking this person also will not agree to marry but salon Kieschnick himself said where you are searching they were going to this village that village this house that house but he in he seems upset go to jayram but he is a six kilometre away another village go to jail mati in the Mukerji's house mock up at the house there is a girl and she's marked for me I will marry her only so he knew everything not that she serrano Krishna saw mother no rather mother saucy Ramakrishna when she was only three years old in a function was going on usually in our country there in the village the ladies will be sitting in one part and the gel people and she was a three years old girl somebody some lady was keeping her on her lap and then just out of fun arcs there are so many young boys that they're only like two and immediately she pointed out that boy that was the ramakrishna so this is the way they knew each other is it just ordinary just accidental no with putting jab bhi na shamsher even they knew when the person is going to die after the date what will happen where he is going to go it was so easy for Saddam o Krishna to tell whoever is coming to him immediately he is telling in your last birth you were there I saw you there as if everything is known to him some people will be coming apparently very religious with all religious marks they'll be putting all different type of marks on their head for aid and naturally they show that their religious person but Saddam Krishna will understand he never touched their food or water or talk to them that was so how good he is so easy for him Betty padam a big damn sure he knew what is knowledge and what is ignorance in the first few chapters when you were reading in the dis gospel of ceramic ISNA the writer himself the master mihashi the mahindra narco gupta he was a a me in those days he came ceramic is misogyny extreme about his wife and in those days the ladies they were girls were not attending the schools so the naturally the master Masai said she is good but ignorant thinking that not getting school education with ignorant immediately that was the first time ceramic is now saved and hold were all people whoever will be listening and reading it they wonder only knowledge is no only one and that is God to no one is knowledge to know many is ignorance have you ever heard it before a Cajun an armed gang ack means one if you can understand one then you are knowledgeable person and if you see many that means you are not you are ignored you mom achetez sarvatra Tsar Bomba muy bisciotti bhagavad-gita shri krishna says who can see only me the one in every being there is nothing but you so that is called knowledge with putting the creation been our shamsher in Sanskrit cha means end the creation and the dissolution both in you be dumb a bit young what is with the notice of a sriracha bhagavati if anyone is having dis quality then only he is it can be called as bound you know each and every one will be having the Vagabond title this themselves will put under their disciples also had it without knowing what does it mean now in India even the Supreme Court they are giving the verdict that no one who are not actually are permitted should use red light because the people they are very much eager to put a red light on the car and to show that he is a VIP very important person and the moment the red light will be there then usually he will be getting so many benefits and that's why they've many people they like to and who is going to check so naturally the Supreme Court now taking stay they should not otherwise they should be punished so like that everybody is using the word vagabond now someday the Supreme Court will say if you use the bugger bond you have to prove otherwise you will be punished then only perhaps or otherwise it's going on in the name bhagavad what is Raghavan heat person he himself doesn't know in vishnu purana again it's telling you sure yes hear some of Grecia the whole wealth some of God various here yo shazia shreya Gianna vairagya Yas chamber shanna maaga et's rhythm see the vishnu purana there they have given the definition you have to have the six spatial qualities the first and foremost is the reaches you should have the all power all capacity what is this richness jewelry of course anything in this world can we achieve if the God wills it can you can notice we do not know majority of ours almost all the gods and goddesses small G of Hindu gods and goddesses they're having lot of jewelry and we love to give jewelry what does it mean we do not know we do not understand but actually it is one of the symbol that God can achieve all leisure all the reaches everything and this not only the jewelry this is a or accept some golly and other gods and goddesses some of the Sheba cali so they are without any jewelry all gods and goddesses are having elodie that Durga the jagged are three Lakshmi Saraswathi all beautiful and decorated with the jewelry and so much and so much because of these are you sure here it's nothing to do with the ordinary gold or other jewelry is it is actually that a charger only these the worldly things world richness known at the same time all the time in India the in our philosophy the moment this is something both the meanings one is the ordinary world meaning and the spiritual meaning I sharjah means all the richness of the spirituality it is in God bhagawan sri ramakrishna was having nothing then also he said if I knew this world is true then I would have covered the whole my birthplace kamar to covet gold Judy jantung a jawad shutup if I knew this world is true kamar hakusho Nadia decotis Tom and now I was reading in American newspaper their dimension the very peculiarly Indian people have a hankering for gold and just before the Kali Puja I think now the business community down they have advertised in this way this particular day one shouldn't one must have a little golden days Keisha Keisha Sorna something that the before the Kali Puja day all they go out the purchase at least a little portion of gold the gold should be there when the girl is married gold should be given the so much of fashion of gold people will be and naturally now the gold is very very costly now this way the oil just some ugly richness richness of both everything the god is having in his power then bilious here William in strength he's having all the strength Raghavan serum Krishna we call him Bhagavad one gentleman came he was asking he was born over here just as an ordinary person only 1836 we know the father the mother the whole life how can you call him away one he has not shown any miracle has he not shown any miracle look at swami vivekananda is the greatest miracle of vivek see Rama Krishna who is he just an ordinary student of calcutta university he came his dude he called the American people 7000 best minds of America sisters and brothers and everybody stood up and started clapping what was their miracle of sci Ramakrishna's various here he is having all power strength ceramic richness in his own life also so many times he has shown his strength a person who was so famous ketchup chunder Shan in those days he was also a dharma guru religious leader sri ramakrishna went to meet him and the moment serum Krishna reached talked he became his disciple is it so easy to just influence a person just like that a person like his personality they say that he was invited to died with the queen of the England Queen Victoria think of it the so powerful Queen in those days and these two say when Kashyap speaks old world listens then afterwards it was proved when Saddam o Krishna speaks a Chablis is it not the power rear tremendous power salon Krishna himself sometimes some people who will come to have a dialogue with him they are all highly qualified people and surround Krishna will try to hide he said dr so will raid will burst people i am an idiot mother why you are sending these people to me only to insult me he will go to his mother mcauley and he go on complaining and trying to as the children will always when they are afraid go and take shelter behind the mother he'll be going and taking the shelter behind the mother of the universe but the mother will Buescher or push him she will push the Ramakrishna to go and face these people the moment they come before him immediately a tremendous power he himself is staring comes within me and I just look at them and say nothing they are nobody so like this one person came he had the occult power used to come and challenge in debate in India we had to had lot of fighting but not with the sword but it world the debating you have to prove that I am not that way educated in the scripture Shankar Acharya Buddha they did and he came and he used to shout a lot when the person the opponent is sitting telling something immediately he will be shouting that was his occult power through that shouting he will be taking away the opponent's power and he makes Ramakrishna when this person shouted immediately slam Vishnu stood up and shouted much higher than he and he also shouted he ambition also repeated all people gather together what they are doing they are not understanding then ultimately that man lost all his occult power to see Ramakrishna so this is the barrier the strained jesus also showed he called a dig man to life is kind of any ordinary person can do Jesus they call the dead man to life he worked on the water he faid the multitude as they say many many people just a small piece of bread everybody was satisfied sri krishna who him he was remembered by the Kunti Draupadi because one rishi came and that was a plan by darude on the rishi in every little thing used to get angry and two cuts and it was very powerful rishi people were very afraid that he should not be angry otherwise the cursing means they're everything they are going to lose and he came with so many disciples when all the food was over he came and said we are hungry give us food the moment anyone comes to your home and asked for food you are supposed to give and that too and now he said ok I am giving a little time we are going for the bathing in the meantime prepare and 1000 people accept miracle it is impossible then the lady started meditating on Krishna o Krishna please help me help me help me because this man will now come up to some time and who obviously geen to give us the curse but no one can help us except you because he worth of God yourself Krishna appeared and said are you having little food give it to me and he she found yes everybody has already eaten and they were in the jungle in the Exile bad we'll get food provision so anyway a little food was left over there she gave it to Krishna and Krishna took it and said let everybody be satisfied why we offer food to God because of that with that intention the moment God is accepting my food each and every one way wherever he should be satisfied as because we cannot call like the dro body so the Krishna is not coming God is not coming we are giving the food and just we are giving without any devotion and faith but if one can do sri ramachandra just his name was written they were writing the name on a stone and throwing on the work in the water it was floating people doubt but is nothing to doubt this is real your strength anything can happen that's why I Ramakrishna again and again ciggy see your science cannot prove it there are many many things up there which can be done if the God wills it can now we sure yes system of Garcia this is the charger then will ya Yasha the frame the Rama the Krishna the Salam o Krishna the Jesus Christ all over the people the new who were they kings Ramakrishna of course they were kings but about see Ramakrishna if you goat and the journals in those days and the book so many people wrote about salam o Krishna who was he as a priest in the dictionary temple he was not having anything who was Jesus but the whole of midlist people they were discussing about Jesus only either criticizing or appreciating either having their enemy t or the becoming the follower but as from aviva conversate either you have to criticize me appraise me you cannot ignore me you cannot ignore me because this is my personality means this is called Yasha the fame Saddam occasional naval lectured like the cash option regime sanam tishnar never wrote anything like the Michael mother Susan docta he was never in the power he was having nothing but everybody was knowing his name this is called Yasha the fail so first is a charger he is having the wealth of all spiritual at the same time the worldly wealth then he was having the various strengths and when you are discussing about the strength we can think of the strength that we get through the meditation through this as they call it this yoga if you practice the yoga you get austere cd8 different types of power supernatural power aster CT aneema mahima garima laghima then property prakhar mia ashit wah bah talk so these eight different power the gate now we have seen in the life of Mahavira a new on G the people will be wondering just because they have not practicing now suppose hundred years before can anyone thought of this computer now I am speaking over here standing over here in America in a village of America the owner claim and in Calcutta in other places they directly they are seeing me hearing me hundred years before if you had talked like these people would have put him in the fire though he is possessed and now it is so natural everybody is stealing sharmaji are you having skype please call me in skype this so natural so normal in the telephone also when you are talking you can see the person who is talking he can also like that it's so easy now everything is so easy when the science it is coming then people can accept and when the same thing Yoga is telling we cannot now through the yoga this anima the small the huge body mahavira when he was going suddenly there was a demon and he said now you cannot go you have to pass through my mouth okay case it all right open up your whip open your mouth I am coming the moment you opened them out he became so small we just passed through that when you close them out he was out already and similarly it will it happened when at the gate of the Sri Lanka there was also a goddess and she told you cannot pass me and Hanuman became so small she couldn't find a one-on-one entered and then afterwards this way one can become small one can become very weak the anima then mahima gigantic when he was bound they took to the court of the rivanna ravana was sitting on the throne oh no one said what they have not given even a small chair for me ok I will make the chair he was going on spreading his body and the tail and the tail became so big equal to the chair of the throne of the king Ravana is that over there people are wondering how this can be done and this is so easy the people could do like this in those days people is to to get this they used to practice there was a demon they call it Damon now it is because they went against the ramachandra but they were you nice now if you go and tell our devotees of sri ramachandra the ilume on is not that this on amana of the monkeys that we see on the trees they won't believe that is our ignorance oh no mana was a yogi and all the hana hana that we see that was a clan the cost they used to wear the mask of alumina so there are many other instances of there they were actually human being and a new mana was a human being in one place from aviva conga also mentioned he was a yogi and the monkey ordinary monkey cannot control the mind yogi means totally controlled minded he was having all the power that is why how much I'm the selected him he knew that you'd be able to do it by ordinary power it is not possible so he was having austere shitty an imam mahima means gigantic then garima means a li the Bema he was going in here to find out some flour and he was very proud of his strength oh I can fight with the elephant also i am the most powerful person in this world hanumana who was a son of the air God and pavana putra and dima was also the son of the same God the obviously hanumana he failed my brother he is reading his power just by having that ego have to help him so he took the form of a old monkey lying on the road and the tail from this side to that side covering the whole road and this is the custom in India that you should not cross the body of any person because inside the body God resides while we come and touch the feet of the venerable people our elderly people not because of the person because God resides and he will always see the elderly people who will always touch that young people and will kiss because the God resides so both way we do that is the system we always practice an awana came a be a beemer came he saw the 101 are lying over there and he said hey Anna wanna can you please take your till when one side I left to go I cannot cross your body hana wanna say it's look at me i am so old so sick i cannot move it why don't you just try and move it help me then he must say it okay he took ill try to leave the tail tail of a only small monkey so he took tried to lift the tail with him left hand what is so easy then he tried to the right hand heavier he couldn't do anything with both the hands then the Bema he used his full power he could not even lift and each that till then he understood he is not ordinary monkey something special who are you please forgive me please bless me then huh no mana took his own form and said why you are thinking that you were the most powerful person in this world God is the all-powerful he is helping you so you are having little physical strength don't be proud of it the women learned and he was humble so this is the the Grima means the heaviness he could do it sometimes three ama Krishna the small little boy of hardly seven days or eight days and his mother kept it on the bed and covered the little boy with a little mosquito net and she went out came and saw where is the little boy full grown person sitting as lying and she was shouting started shouting something has happened to my son something then the father will come and say don't say like that don't you know he's not ordinary he is the Vishnu himself and someday they will be picking up the small little boy he's so light there's no problem keeping the child on the lab for a long time and someday he's so heavy the mahi is to play with the mother the simple hearted mother sometimes and all the time she is afraid something has happened to my child so who I suddenly he's also hey b/c Ramakrishna the vagabond having all the power the hey Venus used to become small his to become big is to become light used to become heavy laghima means light then property obtained the moment they thing to get something immediately the gate that is the power of yoga and Salam o Krishna of course a little bit he showed because he was not asking the dis people because we are all now in the modern days if we get this power think of it what will happen if we get at least one power what will happen so that is the reason the ceramic Krishna who is the god of the present day he said don't practice all this and through his direct disciple his beloved disciples narendra not we can under he said these are not the things that you should hanker for then he said to narendra i can give you all the 80 called power will you take look at it if he gives me even the offer i think i will at least take one or two but immediately the northern the not say is it going to help me to realize God is it no but people will appreciate thousands of people will come to you you will become very powerful person is that I don't need I need only those things that will help me to realize God so this power when it was to obtaining the moment you thing you get see Ramakrishna wanted some pure hearted people because he was having technology wanted to give it to them so that they can spread it for the ordinary people for the masses and he went on the rooftop and give a call or eat or a cake otay achish I where you are my children come I am sitting over here to give it to you all the trees ER that I have got through my austerity and then suddenly started coming the Narendra north rachal babu ram sharra all very pure hearted young generation he give the call and the king whatever he wanted it happened one day his young disciples they were hungry and there was nothing in the in his room and you are saying what do you want to eat then naturally the wishes is nothing wrong to dream then he said mal pas mal was a special type of a sweet that is particularly they preparing been God and suddenly the moment they were discussing about malpua one it came from Calcutta and one lady was getting doubt with getting down from the boat with a full jar full of malwa and surround busines immediately called all the young people come come come malish achievement wha he is not telling the full name he is telling the half of it mala Shh it has come now come and enjoy it the moment do you think it appears over there he was thinking oh if I could give a fencing over here that this plant that I have planted work and I must give the fencing but where I will get all the wars and the rope and all those things are necessary to give the fence next day morning he found something some from somewhere a full thing which were necessary to give the fencing drifted in the water and there it is lying like this it happen many many times if you read the life of all these people particularly Raja Maharaja he was sitting all alone on the bank of a river know where no people then one day he was thinking oh if I could get hot Lucci another special food in Bengal the Lucci and these and these I could enjoy eating next day morning another person is over there mine his God was his Ishta devatha is ramachandra he said no sir i was searching for though for you la yesterday also as such somehow I could get you in today please take this thing and eat and he saw whatever he thought it is there then he was asking how could you know that I want to eat all these because last night so many times my god came and told my son is waiting over there he wants to eat this prepare properly and take it to him he said how could you know that i am the son that the god Rama was indicating he showed two whole area he showed it's not once thrice I saw him then last time drama became so angry that I am NOT getting up so I got up in the midnight and prepared the whole food and I am coming to you please accepted if you moment wish everything is done so that is why when your holy person goes to somebody's house if he is even insulted he pray for those people otherwise if he is angry some wrong may happen that said the holy person particularly there should be very very careful and when they're going over there they do not know many times they do not know but a little power is there if they are angry on someone it becomes very bad for that he doesn't know the person is not understanding so the person who is trying to be holy to realize God they must always be concerned that they should not think anything wrong against any person the moment anything sometimes may happen in the work if you are little angry immediately come and pray to God for his benefit or heart benefit taco I just became really angry please don't mind he is or she is alright there was a lady the mad hunting the famous character in the life of Marsha the money baby and that she used to go on abusing the mother though mother is to take her all care and she all through her life was taking care of hot daughter Radu pugly mommy is to call there as a imbalance to know that mommy that lady one day what happened she came certainly without any sound she was abusing mother as usual mother was going on dressing the visit of working suddenly somehow he took a very big size brinjal and came from the back and give it very powerful blow on the back of the mother and it was so painful mother cried shouting and then turned and saw her and somehow from her mouth only once in a life it cards came out and in that curse he said Taku never touched this body even when she was if he was somehow through a flower at me he always taken care of me are you hard and now you have given me so much pain later you that hand be spoiled and it will come out from your body hot khushi kabhie and then immediately she took the dust from her own feet and was going on giving on her head and was going on crying and praying oh my god what I have done why I have cast her it is only to prove that they are not ordinary people very powerful people the moment is saved everything it happened like that this is aisha area samagra Vidya Yasha then shreya the beauty then ghana by rakia these are the another three we will discuss in our next class so this is a beautiful way they are giving austere  d the aneema mahima garima laghima property prakhar Mia and a sheet wha we will discuss in our next place is already 830 this two things helps us we'll just concluding that top oh BTW archer be pressure mystery shack karim param nice ria shekharan purim pupusas kilija mohanty bataye amrita mas naughty tapasya means the mind is green to so many places so many things again in again drawing it back and putting at the feet of the sea de Bourbon god lord that is tapasya what is tapasya mouth sargam reader is telling what is the for sure trying to remember God every moment that is the version trying to remember God every moment and then iana having faith in the words of holy person like cinema Krishna Jesus Masada believing in their words and praying praying and brain tapas are collision on d that is seen they wash away all the scenes and vidya Amrita must know they and that knowledge that we God is there too sure because bhagwan serum disna say I can see God because vagabonds round krishna say I can talk with God because ceramic ashina promised only thing I have to do two things I have to go on trying 24 hours every moment to keep my mind on the fate of God and go on practicing as bhagavan sri rama krishna gana knowledge God is one all-pervading that I will practice it the friends next again will read about this chapter and go farther let us conclude by offering our to Nam to the present day God in the form of Saddam o Krishna Nealon ginamit iam anantara bum bak tonneau compa Drita Bikram boy ye chaahat arum para Misha medium tomorrow
