[245: Panchama Veda 245 : How Long Should One Perform Worldly Duties?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogqXa2g4w5A)

good evening dear devotees and friends today is wednesday and here in america the hindu people are celebrating the janmastami is a great day the supreme lord he advented in the form of sri krishna and he protected the people people of the brindavan and then he guided the whole bharat varsa and guided towards the righteousness towards the dharma he was a great personality not only in the spiritual world but also in politics in social in friendly in all aspect we find that bhagavan's sri krishna is so perfect so our offering to the bhagavan sri krishna and the same krishna and the same personality which took the form of sri krishna came as sri ramakrishna and in the modern times sri ramakrishna was born in 1836 it was not necessary the way the krishna deed is the same god he is taking the human form and he is guiding the human towards himself go back to god as they say this created the human being gave them their thoughts and then directing them himself in the form of a human being as sri ramachandra as sri krishna and in the modern time we find sri ramakrishna the guiding towards god but the srirama krishna time it was not necessary to take the people towards the warfield it was the time when sri ramakrishna the god he transformed the minds of people the transformation so that is why the hindus they don't convert people conversion to some extent imposing my idea our idea on some other people whether they like it or not love it or not accept it or not forcefully so when we are converting means it's a forceful transition of my thought to another person but it is transformation it's not conversion the hindus they believe in transformation and the transformation that is exactly what sri ramakrishna did the people who are engaged in the worldly life and thinking that the world is permanent and very sincerely seriously they're trying to find out the peace the happiness the joy from those worldly things then the god comes and says i have created that worldly things it can never give you peace never give you joy never give you happiness because that is all temporary and the mayabadins those who are provoking that propagating the theory of maya they will say it is all illusory so that is the beauty of the bhagavatama krishna and all not we we should not say all because master mashay came for only a few years but whatever he recorded those things and exactly the the exact words of bhagavan's ramakrishna he presented to us and every wednesday we read that gospel of srama krishna which is nothing less than the veda so we can call it as a panchama veda the fifth veda now let us start as usual by chanting from the gopi gita khabib kalmar shaham this is the word only the words and by that he is changing the minds of the people but is it that all people were transformed no but that depends on the person's karmapala also and that is the reason even if the god is coming before us god is taking the position of a guru and guiding us to to our spiritual path those who are not capable they won't be able to do any benefit out of that because the samskara the karmapala but that apart let us again read salama krishna he was visiting the brahma-samaj it is in the siti we are reading that particular chapter and here that gentleman he was asking and when sudama krishna said they have faith he said no how can that be because we are sinners the last our discussion last discourse we discussed on this particular the sub-judge said i am a sinner how can i say that god dwells in me he said that the sudama krishna almost rebuked he said how is it how can you think like that you are an educated person how can you think like that that he is not going again once again to that level so oh this is how the creation came but any person sensible person they know this creation it is god made and god created out of himself because there is no other matter there cannot be existence of the two there that only the god was there so at that time in the veda upanishad it says so naturally god has created out of his own and we are also god no christian no doubt should be there but why the separation because the god has given us some ego we wrongly taken those egos and that's why i am thinking that i am separated but in reality it is not only i am thinking you know sometimes there are some people with the mental problem mental diseases they are that they think that they're somebody and that is the problem then we say we send them to the mental asylums we treat them in a different way so why that person is thinking that he is a doctor or he is the prime minister of a country or he is somebody all others all around they can't see they know they see how this is an ordinary person my neighbor my friend we grew up together but go to that particular person he said no no no i am so and so why we call it mental disease what is the blockage i am thinking that is the problem so the doctors slowly slowly treat them in a different way and try to say that you are not that the same almost the same way all of us the whole humanity we are thinking that we are human being and then we are thinking one after another that we are indian we are american we are these we are that that we are hindu we are christian we are buddhists we are muslim that we speak these were this family that was one after another we are going on superimposing on the original thing so it has gone so deep now too we have to go on digging to find out our original thing who is me who am i then so who is that original thing that this sudama krishna is telling it is god you are god but that educated person like the sub-judge he said no no that how can that be we are seniors sirama krishna is almost rebuking and then he said one must have faith that the when one say i have uttered the name of god i have repeated the name of rama or hari how can i be a sinner very simple i have uttered the name of god that much uttered means that i have the faith the i am that god that faith when i say the immediately all other things should go out so that is the way the treatment is going on we are truly god but like a lunatic we are thinking that we are weak human being and i am a male and it's a female and the child and the poor and educated uneducated so many different epithets so many different uh uh because many different qualities we are putting on that so many so that is why srama krishna is telling to break that the first step is the faith now this is a very very difficult thing to understand why should i believe ramakrishna's question that you should believe and how can say how can one have such faith faith that i am god and then person is telling how can one have such faith then why suramar krishna used to go to those assemblies of the brahmas because they were educated people did an educated society of calcutta majority they became the members of the brahma samaj of course many of them there were also the traditional hindus but sudama krishna is to go to them the brahmas mainly why they were little advanced people they were little modern people and they were having some idea of religion they were trying to be religious the salaam krishna is to go to them because it is a philosophy and the philosophy means the one who is having the basic concept can understand what suramar krishna is telling you are god if we go to and tell the person who is not having the basic idea then it will be tremendous it will be backfire as they say you say i am god or good then i can do anything and everything no one is there to question me that will be another problem so that is why you have to go and tell to those people who at least some basic education to understand that so they are trying to understand suramar krsna's they are asking question and this time he's selling said how can one have such faith surrounding krsna's have faith that you are god you are uttering the name of god and you are pure how can we have that sudama krishna now is telling oh lord is it ever possible to know thee without love you sing these songs ramakrishna is telling that person however much one may perform worship and sacrifice one may perform worship and sacrifice if i don't have the love and how the love will come by knowing how i will know understanding so this is one step goes always constantly then we reach to that love when i can love god the concept of god means he is all-pervading and i am loving an ideology a concept and then i am trying to give a personality into that like the janma ostomy so that the sri krishna is the balagupala not the krishna of the kurukshetra who is directing the whole war no it is the lay baby krishna and all are trying to feed and to give all their love on that baby krishna the lord the supreme lord is coming into that form and we like the people majority of the people they like that pure form of the god as a child so the love comes why i'm thinking the god is a child and my love for the child half for the baby is going towards god so that conception slowly taking a human form and i am liking to concentrate on that and ultimately what i am learning that god alone exists so that is the faith now friends when the bhagavan's rama krishna is telling the viswas or the faith what is that faith actually assumption i am i heard from my father that my grandfather was so and so and he is to live over there i heard from my father now i am believing the words of my father then i go to that particular place to meet the grandfather father see i first learned from the father that his father living in a distant village a heart i accepted i assumed or it must be so so this is called the faith on the words of the father basing on that i am going to that particular place then meeting that particular gentleman and accepting him as my grandfather paying my respect and love everything going on on the assumption is it not faith it is also faith when i grew up on the lap of a lady i accept her as my mother as a faith the whole life human whole life is nothing but faith and then the person he's flying in the sky and going to another far away land having the faith that the control the time the instructions that i am receiving from the control tower will guide me properly because you can't see anything on the high altitude all these clouds are below you cannot see can't see the earth also you are almost nowhere but at the same time you are having the complete faith the people sitting over there will be properly guiding me and i fly that that aircraft and look at the captains of the ships the modern day so many modern equipments are there but in the olden days the wooden ships and they used to sell an uncharted sea they are going just having some rough sketches if we go into this this way and there will be a star and the right night time and the day time this all this assumption assumption assumption and they were sailing isn't it faith that we will reach somewhere so if we can have that faith to realize god our own self our own identity the source of all our joy and peace and happiness you say what try why not so that is the what bhagavan's rama krishna is telling and the gentleman told we are sinners now what is the scene swami vivekananda said any thought any word any action which causes suffering to other is seen para pirana papa para piridana para means the others peed on a creating problem the means of suffering that is i say it's something which hard the mind of others sometime in the school the some children will be there bullying on others in the schools and colleges in the offices also some people the moment they will go there meeting over there working together but trying to belittle others why you have also applied you have also learned your gun over there and you are working over there that is that sufficient no he is not suffering then he will go on bullying on others trying to over bossing on others then one day he will leave that particular office and go somewhere else but as long as he was there he was creating problem for others that is called sin the same the papa means this the words that we use if that hurts the person the way that we behave if the heart the others that is papa so when we say that we are sinners in what sense so obviously we can rectify ourselves these are all the mistakes then when these are the mistakes the obviously we can rectify the bhagavatama krishna is telling that this you must have pray to god in secret and yearning and that you may have the passionate attachment and devotion to him to have to develop the love for god we have to pray to god the shade tears for him then only it is possible we have to go and cry before the god long for god day and night all the moment that is paused then triloka said sir where is people's leisure they must serve their english masters trilogy then sudama krishna immediately he is telling well then give god the power of attorney if we cannot have a pray to god because we don't have the time then give the power of attorney to god himself god you have kept me in this world in this way i can't find the time to call on you but please don't forget me whatever i am doing you are responsible for that so guide me in that way so you give that responsibility to god and god will guide you god will take the response but you must all the time remember then you are not there your ego should not be there because you have given the attorney power of attorney to god there will be nothing for you to take the decision oh i am telling this you must do it no you can't so that is the power of attorney so when we say that we don't have the time to pray to god and we depend on god to do on our behalf that is also the process is there but thing is you should be completely aloof whatever is happening no reaction should be there is it possible that means you forget yourself that means you are completely free from your ego that is a very high spiritual position and that is the reason then the sub just say sir we are householders how long should we perform our worldly duties see house ramakrishna their questions are so practical very practical questions first is our minds are very weak so obviously we are constantly thinking is it possible for us to realize god because we are impure what is the impurity the more you think that you are impure for everything the more you become impure because you are going on brooding on the impurity the more you think that i am pure because god has made me i am the son of god i am the daughter of god how can i be sinner i have done some mistakes and i take the oath that in the next day i am not going to repeat that that's all by that what is sadhana what is spiritual practice nothing but going on taking the oath that i am going to change myself i am going to change myself that's all that is the way we continue now the subcharge he is asking a wonderful question you know the householders in a traditional hindu family they say you have five responsibilities what are the five responsibilities and uh i think the last sunday we discussed about that they say in the hindus they say whatever the great sacrifice that you should do the first is that you should not forget god because the god has created you god is helping you to sustain and ultimately you will march to god so you should not forget that so rishi yagya so rishi jagya ngri like this like this five duties a worldly person should do householder should do the man who is living in the world these are his spiritual duties he must read at least some pages of the scripture from the from the scripture he must read every day why because the rishis they discovered those truths and if you are not reading that you will forget and this is the reminder again and again that you are not an ordinary peop person you are pure but this moment you are surrounded by something you have to overcome that that is called rishi yankya ng you must love your neighbor you must love the people with whom you are leaving you must feel for them you try to help them concern from them so this is the way you are broadening your own mind and thought we must remember our forefathers for them only we are today so that tradition should be there to remember them maybe with the father and the grandfather sometimes you remember up to that is okay or at least just imagine that in that family that i have borne we have born so we must remember and thank them and by because of them we grew up in this way this is the way we should express our gratitude yagya means expression of the gratitudes also the praniyakya that is also there all animals and the reptiles and the birds we should not forget them they are also part of our family part of our life so the loving the nature thinking about the nature protecting the nature that is also yagya you know sometimes we carry the plastic bags and so many plastic items and then after use we just throw it we don't care what's going to happen maybe that i was carrying something into that and when i throw that plastic bag the smell of the thing that was there inside attract a puppy and it was nearby it comes and entered into that plastic bag and unfortunately the that it cannot come out don't you think that you are committing sin so this is the scene and we think no i didn't do anything i didn't have anything anybody i didn't kill anyone it's a wrong conception so one must be very much alert these are the duties of the grihasthas of the householders always alert i am not going to heart anyone anything through my behavior through my words and my activities so this is slowly making you purified what is the purification you are constantly feeling for the others and one day your guru will say all that you see is nothing but the manifestation of the same god the god you are worshiping inside the shrine the god you are worshiping within your heart that's why bhagavan sirama krishna said can't you see god with your open eyes if you can see god by closing your eyes in meditation why can't you see god all around you there's a wonderful revelation the moment we can do that the moment we are alert every moment of our life that is called jiban mukta that is the ultimate the highest form of all spiritual practices jivan mukta free while leaving how i see my god in everything in every being so these are the karmas how long shall i have to perform that was the question and the master said surely you have duties to perform you must bring up your children support your wife and provide for her in case of your death everything one should think bhagavan's ramakrishna himself he asked maha sharadamani devi how many chapatis how many rotis you take in the night mother was so ashamed why he is asking this question the ladies naturally then the mother told why you are asking this question no after me how you will survive i have to calculate that and keep some provision for you so that is called because he married and he was so responsible for the wife so this is called dharma i i when i marry a man is taking the oath that i will protect you as my wife and wife is also taking the oath on that day that i will also cooperate with you in every action so that is called marriage and the man should not forget so that dharma so he is protecting sudama krishna is teaching that dharma you should you must keep your word if you don't then i shall call you unkind look at it i read again surely you have duties to perform you must bring up your children support your wife and provide for heart in case of your death if you don't then i shall call you unkind sages like shukhadeva had compassion he who has no compassion is no man now the duties of the householder is to take care the responsibilities of his family then of course the society is there you have to take care of the society too paying the taxes some people are so clever they will earn and they will try to deceive the government by not paying the taxes they think that they are very clever but ultimately they are committing sin that's a great mistake you should have to because you are accepted of course government also should take care that the people the wind they are paying their taxes that should go back to the society through development work that is of course those who are in the administration side it is their responsibility king's duty ruler's duty but the subject he is supposed to pay one should not hide one should pay if you can't there are other methods are also there so obviously religious development means a complete development and when that complete development comes a person a human become godly very pure why no impurity no hiding no hiding anything from anyone so that is that we can have the complete trust on him that is what ramakrishna is telling how long should one support one's children before we conclude this small part of the question that the subjects asked how long should we perform our worldly duties i like to quote from the asta bhaktrasana meta he is telling to his disciple raja janaka prabhupada now the people in the worldly life they have their duties but those who have accepted the monastic life the spiritual life not entered into the householder's life do they have some duties or not of course they have and how they should perform that and here the ashtabakra means very highest form of the spiritual activities in that highest form the ashtabakr teaches activity or inactivity action or inaction not surely problem for the wise people wise people don't feel any problem don't see any problem in activity or inactivity when there is work they will be completely whole mind they will work into that when there is no no work they will be meditating they will be reading they will be talking with the people and their mind is constantly on the higher level of spirituality and they won't go over seeking the work and the next line it says you live happily so that is for the people the monastic life that they have accepted and for them whatever comes that one of our very senior swami i liked him very much viswami ananya nandaji who was the president of the astra when i was there the many times he used to say don't seek don't shun you know that the monastery we have the different type of duties and the in charge will say now you please go and look after this particular work sometimes the kitchen you have to look after and you have to go and purchase the provisions you have to work with the cook and you have to supply the food to the members who are there so that is the job you should do that is work and when that authority is asking you to take up that work no i never did that i don't know how to do so there will be some so then the anand is to say don't seek don't shun whatever comes before you that is your duty and try to perform as best as possible so that is the way the monastic members should also think and if you are if you are not doing anything but using the monasteries the property the food you are taking you are that shelter that you are taking and you are also having the clothings all everything of your life as long as you're leaving you're taking from that monastery in exchange what you are giving nothing that means you are indepthing yourself into that we don't understand that we think we are very clever we are not doing anything when we are getting all all the support from this organization not nothing goes unnoticed everything is calculated by the supreme god so that is one should be very very careful how long should you do that then question comes when the mind is completely marched in god you cannot think except god all the time every moment there is a completely different condition and that is why this yoga bashist in the the with the rama and his guru then the bhagavata and also the mundaku punisher all these three great scriptures they have quoted these words when that condition comes then no question of work when one has realized that brahman and all doubts are banished then there is no question of in doing any work and completely free if you do or not do nothing happens your presence after the realization of the god after the realization of the brahman the presence of that particular person is sufficient for the human society his thoughts his words his presence inspired the other people develop faith in the existence of god that is his sufficient or before one should do something or other whatever the responsibility one should perform as maximum as possible and then afterwards when the work is done one should say rama krishna namaste we the followers of krishna we offer all our action at the feet of the srama krishna so the person who was asking this question how long so long when you feel that you have some duties to perform you must perform i have seen in balloon mart the elderly swamis they would come and sit with us and help us to dress the vegetables and sometimes they will pick up when they are moving slowly they will pick up the some crashes maybe a piece of cloth or a paper or a dry leaf they will pick it up and put in the proper place so why because everything should be neat and clean everything should be proper when the devotees are coming to the temple to the shrine to the astrama they should feel that they have come to a holy place when the people are coming and talking to them very nicely courteously gently one should behave so these are the monastic training and in the householder's life one must have the responsibility for the family responsibility for the society and then finally he is responsible for his own spiritual growth so this is the work together we should do and then slowly slowly time will come we need not to ask anyone by the grace of god if that blessed day come you will never feel any responsibility for anything so that sudama krishna is telling sabjaj again is asking how long should one support one's children so he is naturally his question is very good questions the how long one should work to support the family and how long one should support the children than srama krishna as long as they have not reached their majority when the cheek becomes a full grown bird and can look after itself then the mother bird picks it and doesn't allow it to come near heart everybody is laughing tsunami krishna observation he saw the how the birds they are behaving mother bird they will teach them how to fly they will push them they know that they are already there the wings have become strong and it will be sufficient to support them so the mother bird will push them and then they will automatically they will open up their wings and they will flow and then they will get the joy that is the way all treatment and the human society also the same thing one should do no one should develop the children in such a way that ultimately they depend on their parents no why as a human he should have his own self-respect his or her own self-respect i must earn and i should support myself father has supported me after this now i should fly i should learn to get my food but the human society the parental properties and all those things come down it should not be i feel it should not be like that rather after supporting the children whatever the wealth the gentleman should have should go back to the society he should donate it back to the society for their own development as the swami vivekananda's father vishna the swamiji the young boy he went to his father his father was a great donor he used to donate a lot so the swamiji went maybe that his mother asked him to go and ask that question you are donating all things what you are leaving for us his father he was the great successful the advocate he took him before a mirror and asked him to stand before the mirror and say whom you see to myself i am leaving you i have given you the education now you should help yourself why you should depend on my property my money so that is the great teaching because whatever the wealth is accumulated it should go back good back to the society so then the another individual should grow in his own way but otherwise the imbalances come in the economy in the society so that is the teaching the spiritual teaching means a complete growth of not only an individual but the whole human society so suramar krishna is telling the you must support up to that what is a householder's duty to his wife the subjudge he wants to get all this thing clear then sirama krishna you should give her spiritual advice and support her during your lifetime and provide for a livelihood after your death if she is a chest wife support her and give her the spiritual advices why nowadays of course the scenario is little change in those days the ladies were not that way educated but but even then in the society if we see when sun has grown up then the parents naturally they will ask the sun to marry and settle suppose the sun has married then the conflict comes always the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law why because mother-in-law as she is living in that household can't give up the responsibilities but if the gentleman who has kept some provision for his wife and say don't depend on my son's earning we'll be there with them but little separate little distance and don't ever unnecessarily if they are not asking or requesting entered into their family isn't it a good thing so that is it solves so many problems and that is spirituality that is religion that is what suramar krishna is teaching and it is the responsibility of the husband to teach his wife because the lady she was slowly so slowly accumulating all those things decorating the house and obviously and the mostly very sensible it is very difficult for them to detach from all the things she loved all through now this is the training that the husband should give in those days husbands used to be minimum 10 years older than the wife so because of the age and because of the education because of the social thing they had that capacity and they used to do that it is the responsibility of the husband to make the wife from the beginning slowly to understand that one day we had to leave and never ever interfere so that is the beautiful training spiritual training after the retirement we too will be separate and we live over there children are all around they'll be coming and supporting us but we are not depending on them and what we should do now we'll slowly withdraw our mind and our attachment should not be so much because every day every moment we should think i have to go somewhere else i have to cross this ocean i have to go back to god my duties are over it's not something this is melancholy some no not like that completely different the great joy going back to my own swords and i am preparing myself all the game that i used to play now it is all over i can play now used to love this soccer used to love so many different games now it is all over i should withdraw my mind and how to by hearing reading meditating chanting repetition of the god's name by having the company of the holy people and in the retired in the in the retreats in a secluded place i should go on developing that because now this is my when i was born the parents gave me education then when i grew up i entered into the universities and colleges universities and all that and the professional level where i will be successful i knew that these are the things i should do and i got successful i applied got the job there also i earned money all i did and now back calculation after reaching over there enough now i am going back to the source from where i came it's not the mother and the father it is the god i came from god i should go back to god and that is the circle complete in spiritual life the complete circle is that and suramar krishna is telling you must love your children love your family love do you do your duties but at the same time sirama krishna hold on to god with one hand then he is telling you should give a spiritual advice and support but if you are intoxicated with the knowledge of god then you have no more duties to perform as i quoted from the upanishad no doubt will be there so am i not having some duties to my mother to my father of course i am having that duty i will pray for them i will support them from distance but my main support is this intoxicate that means the whole mind is constantly going towards god then you have no more duties then god himself will think about your moral if you yourself cannot do so the god will think about and we have seen there are some other monks there one of our friends who joined along with us at the monastic order he is now a very famous swami he was the only son and his father passed away and within one year after the passing away he wanted to come and join think about the mother she lost the husband and now the son is going away what she will do she came and talked to the president margin told then how can i leave maharaja how can i survive maharaja asks that boy you better go back live with your mother and you not to worry if this thought of the renunciation still remain in your mind in whatever age you can come and join that was a special permission but the young man he went back with the mother but his mind was full with this idea that we should be a monk and monk and monk his mother after some months she understood in the meantime she also understood that she has to leave all alone and then one day she said let us go to bellarmore and pack your things you can go and stay herself came and gave her son to the president maharaja and told take him and make him a very good monk so these are the stories but sudama krishna the god is giving the help and the mother could understand mother could feel that way and detachment comes in the mind of the mother and the all other problems for our survival everything was taken care the relatives came and the friends came they took care of that and slowly slowly she also started frequenting more uh another frequenting that the belure mod and also started meditating repetition so that way the whole family so this is ramakrishna when he says that that god will take care that is true god himself will think about your family if you are intoxicated with him truly if one sacrificing for the god god takes the responsibility of the father and the mother we have seen so many cases if a landlord dies leaving behind a minor sun then a guardian appointed by the court takes charge of the sun these all are points of law you know them he was talking with the the lawyer the subject so he told suppose the father has passed away then the court will take the property and his minor son and will be guided till he is reaching to that age similarly god will take care that is called faith god is there god will look after me and sometimes we face the problems then we lose the faith in god no when we are having the problems we have to go back to god much more more intently pray to him father mother what shall i do now please guide me please guide me guidance will come help will come everything will be settled again once again and much better way than i was expecting then the sabja said yes sir bijay ah priceless words god himself carries on his shoulders all the responsibilities of a person who thinks of him with single-minded devotion and is mad with divine love a minor gets his guardian without seeking him allah when shall i have that state of mind how lucky they are who feel that way this bijay krishna gosvami he was a great lover of god and slowly is he was a man of devotion but then he joined the the another organization brahma samaj and a little deviation came in the company of bhagavan srama krishna he came back to his own the results own root now in devotion that is coming friends we will read these wonderful passages and are in the next wednesday again so let us conclude and if there is a question yes if the children are still there in the in the household they are supposed to take care of the old parents but if the children has become a monk then and as i was mentioning and a very in a divine way they are protected some other people they come they help them and now of course belitbot they have taken the that the project that if the appearance of a monk is there and unattended ramakrishna mission bellarmore they bring them and we have a home and we keep them over there so is it not again the god's way to protect them the same way it will take so thank you thank you for giving your time and once again we will offer our pranam to god and we'll conclude for this wednesday is so you
