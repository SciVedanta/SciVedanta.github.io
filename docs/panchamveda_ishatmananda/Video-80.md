[81: Panchama Veda 81: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLocixuayG4)

it is begin with this loca as you always do before starting before reading the gospel of sri ramakrishna sorrow kasam written custody venom go be very rhythm calm of Shaba hum Geronimo mialam Sri Madhavi comin ova the garden aha and last time when we were studying this is the gospel of ceramic ISNA which is full of spiritual knowledge and very practical way he is delivering giving those who have having that mind that aptitude they only can be benefited they can accept it and utilize it otherwise is so very simple word they are not telling that you have to blow your nose 10 times or holding this way and that way meditate nothing ceramic ISNA in a very simple fashion very simple way he is giving this talk and that to that time it is brahma devotees they were all highly qualified people and then they were well established this people are meeting see Ramakrishna and then see Ramakrishna is giving that talk and convincing them someone was telling at a time of Sri Ramakrishna there were great scholars like ish of gender Shane with the sugar but still how come that see Rama Krishna who was not having that way any education could convince them maybe in a very simple way he talked and was not simple way each and every word that he uttered and over that Swami Vivekanand is telling we can write philosophy the philosophy closed off his after Veloz office as possible quoting from different Scripture but apparently words are very simple now the question was who is really bad man or woman one gentleman asked see Rama Krishna who is really bad usually even the Shankaracharya he has mentioned naari Narakasura dorham the women are the door of the health in those days they always is to think that for team only everything is happening and listen to the words of ceramic ashna he is telling there are two types there are bigger Shakti or with dr shifty shifty power it may be good it may be bad and both are coming from God the same power now suppose this is fire with the fire utilizing fire you can cook food and you can be satisfied and with that fire you can burn a house Shakti is there how you are utilizing that is there and he is telling there are bigger shakti and a beat dat the universe is created by the Mahamaya of God who is this Mahamaya of God is the power of God it is this again it is the god only who has created good and bad and both are forceful what a powerful and this is it has both BTW Amaya what is a big de Maya Maya illusion and he says illusion of knowledge is also ilusion ceramic ish no never studied any Scripture and not the logic at all because he wanted to listen about the logic from the master Marsha and master Mercia was explaining what is logic if this man is like these that man is like this all the people that I see like this so I can infer these people from that part of the land like this salaam Krishna to stop it that there are all the time except exceptions are there so it is not the logic ii never knew the logic but see he is not making any mistake he is stealing that illusion of knowledge knowledge good but still illusion there is not the ultimate why because God is beyond good and bad we always think that God is always good no he is beyond good and bad if there is good there will be bad surely if there is light this darkness surely if anybody is praising you know for sure somebody is criticizing you it goes on always and similarly see Ramakrishna is not making any mistake so when we are reading the gospel of ceramic ISNA is not an oval not a story but the language is so simple we feel it is nothing but if you read have the bottom sometimes we cannot pronounce sometimes we cannot understand the words and sometimes they're all things so we can see how we are reading the great scripture how do you know that is a great scripture because I could not understand anything no that is like that is so simple but at the same time so effective and it says with the Maya the illusion of knowledge one cultivates but choose what type of virtues holy company second knowledge third devotion fourth love and fifth renunciation from renunciation begins the spiritual life but at least beginning with the only company and how wonderful this is unless and until you get idence how you will know and when you are getting the guidance if you have tremendous ego and exactly opposite strong thoughts no benefit and that is why I ramakrishna is telling again that the water cannot be accumulated on the tip of the hill there should be a someplace low then only the water will come and accumulate and it says 'but da da da Theban i'am the banaya and he's become becoming very modest humble because he has understood all that knowledge that i have God it is for because of the God anyone could do it anyone could know it anyone could achieve it just because God has given me this opportunity I am here so he is becoming more and more and more humble how through the bead dog we're from the big becomes we're from these things come from holy company holy company doesn't mean always the people in the in the cladding some type of dress and they're talking about the god they're holy company no mother father sometimes the teachers very good companies see Ramakrishna said go to the devotees who is a devotee whose mind is constantly with God totally dedicated with God all the time talking about god that's the devotee one gentleman came he was talking about so many different experiences of meditation his practicing the Buddhistic way of meditation vipassana and so many names also the he was quoting many of it I don't know then finally I told I haven't stood that you know many things but how I can help you for what you have come to me he said tell me whether it is alright whatever I am doing it is good or not I told are you happy do you accept others also can you accommodate in your thoughts the others then you are on the right track if not there is something wrong raghavan see Rama Krishna is giving this example and he is telling when the mind comes on the fourth this'll there slowly slowly what first second third and the fourth is the heart and then from the heart of the throat then in I in between the eyebrow then under sub tabo me the Wayne it comes the mind comes to the heart then the yogi the person who is meditation meditating sees light and what type of like white light and sometimes it may be broken and sometimes is solid white light like the silver but it is not dazzling so this way he is giving a clearer idea and when the mind comes on the throat is only talk about God you don't like to talk anything else and when it comes to Don the beam between the eyebrow he sees the celestial bodies gods goddesses holy people and that is a wonderful thing and all is once to mind wants to leave over there and then slowly it may come down but won't go below heart so mooladhara and then coming to the heart and then slowly subtab owe me from the mooladhara it's coming up to the South rod when you read see Ramakrishna's in the description it becomes very clear I told that to this gentleman who came are you having this thing I'm really feeling to talk about God talk about holy things are you seeing this celestial being and he was telling I can hold my mind over here it's nothing I can raise the Kundalini any moment I like he was thinking in that way it was great but the thing is result is this so what is the holy company holy company is always inspiration and correcting the path right way everywhere every time this way you should do ceramic ISNA he is asking somebody's house he is visiting householders and the holy man is going that householder is supposed to pay for his up-and-down fear but they won't give their very rich people but they won't give the little money to the ceramic ich nur for the carriage de hire that money he is not giving they are not giving the ceramic ISNA then other people are telling forget it we will pay come on Chris oh no they should pay I have come to them and they're the husband and other people the males they know me they always go to me they have invited me to come over here on their invitation only I have come they should pay how can you explain it because he was teaching he was teaching that you are supposed to pay if you are not doing it then is not any good thing will come on you so he the god himself becoming a guru his teaching go and tell these ladies that their husbands then me they have invited me and I have come they should pay even then the ladies gave only fifty percent the when he came that money they didn't pay only at the time of going one honor to Anna's in those days the salon Krishna told ba kita Delana that means the balance he didn't pay he was not really happy he went to somebody's house they were not a carrying him anyway because they were socializing he is the main attraction but these people they were mixing with others and then welcoming others steadily in a society that they are making the all relations see Rama Krishna is waiting and then sometimes is that they are not giving me food how can I go then the one boy who he was also very rich man's son he told said let us go then he told at this hour where he will get food moreover they should give me food because they have invited me and he forced him to give something and somehow dot that also not those people some another lady through that the working hands maybe the she came and gave some food Sri Ramakrishna took a little and touched in there and then came out praying for them sadhu sanga teaching how a devotee should behave it is wrong if you take in in the wrong way oh my God look at this man he is constantly and going on asking for money asking for food then he won not a devotee then you are not ready to develop in the spiritual life you will be happy in the worldly life that is sure you will get more and more worldly things that sheer God you will never develop in the spiritual life we are talking about the spiritual development those who don't want the spiritual development this is not for them and whatever we stand over here and talk it is only for those people who are interested to develop spiritual life what is the spiritual life eternal joy when it is going to come we are not sure but these will come surely come and that is called as bhagavan sri ramakrishna promised there he is God you can see God you can talk to God you can realize God only thing you have to follow a few things what is that sadhu sanga the tulsa das is telling if you are weighing the joy of heaven and the joy of holy company my dear son the children i will say holy companies more heavier than the joy of heaven why because joy of heaven is temporary and we have got visa in America maybe for four years four years then at the time of coming I told my friends see i am going to America and I will go here I then we are sending the photos to them standing before here there and the they are thinking my god he is enjoying so much he said for years afterwards again back to the same place going on recapitulating how the country was and etc salga our heaven is just like that the heaven is also just like that we are doing something good and we are getting something good over there somewhere and then after all that good we accumulated that is exhausted then they will say thank you goodbye go back again you have to come back over here in the Karma booming so that is why Tulsidas he is pointing out but keep you have the holy company is a permanent effect because these will constantly going on correcting you rectifying you the sometimes I say and some people are not very happy with me I can feel but I feel this is my duty because i am here as a minister in charge this is my duty to tell I don't say directly indirectly through stories I often as I say even then they understand that I am wanting to them and they are angry and now I was thinking why i am telling these because they are not accepting let it be between God and them so many years you are coming I am asking again and again I went to Vancouver I told those devotees also just two things why and how why I am coming to Osama why I am coming to the temple why I am coming to a holy place to a holy person why just ask you yourself and then how I can achieve the best result these are the two things when we join in the we were Brahma gerrans you know that how much the Swami under whom i joined he had a very wonderful system when he is angry he used to smile how are you know the person angry in smiling so I was so happy when he first smiled at me he asked me to do something I did but he was not liking so and he was busy with other people he saw that and then he looked at me and smiled I was so happy that the boss is happy but no the other brahmacari one year senior they had already experienced they told today after the night food you are going to get a good banging you know get ready I told why because he smiled button but smiling when he is angry his vines and that he understood afterwards but that way he rectified rectifier rectified and constantly he went to Antony but he used to love me so much he used to love me so much all the time but his true constantly any little mistake will be scolded and that is called sadhu sanga i went to marketing in a faraway place and almost you know in a very bad shape jeep and the driver his name still I remember or the local person his name is Enoch and he was very fond of smoking than driving he was stopping and lighting that his pipe and then we and afterwards almost every 5-10 minutes we'll be lighting I come there every time it is exhausted it is you should continue or why don't you take the cigarette no you don't and that way anyway we have to go with him and as a brahmacari we are not supposed to take poor in the hotel and the shops and if there is the time cross you know the ramakrishna mission that foot timing is twelve o'clock and at least 15 minutes before you should come or half an hour before you should inform that you are going there then only they will take care of your food or otherwise if you go afterwards they need to say then are some of pila you are creating problem for the awesome ostrom of europe and that we think bad spiritually bad for you so you should have to be very very careful so you have to calculate how much time i am in the market then when i am going to go to the awesome can i make it if not but just some proves and that you have to output sweets not that way so in the big marketing every shop you have to go you have to an india it's not like this you go and take and all things are written it is if they say hundred rupees you have to start with 10 rupees then you will conclude in 25 and like these only every time you have to bark game and then it takes time and afterwards when you came back in the night I saw only one plate and he said become so cold that was a cold place and that is there nobody is waiting for me night at least twelve o'clock and it was so foggy most of the time I was walking and on my back the headlight of the car and then he was coming it is a hill naturally very carefully he was driving exhausted no one waiting only one plate food and then I shared at the driver again and i am doctor i am very young even now also a lot of food but even that time has to now next morning that Swami instead of killing oh this young boy has worked so hard he was telling a you see he could not but gain properly so it was supposed to be fifteen rupees he has given 30 degrees like this he was going on before others I feel so sad look who I am becoming mom this people cannot appreciate it so next day I should leave I was thinking in that way and when you are angry you know the emotional the first thing that you do stop eating so I also said that this morning i am not going to eat and we went and slipped and I fell so and am I trying to sleep but so much hungry I couldn't sleep so someone came and called me to his office you know what you say he said you were expecting you are not happy like why not happy because they are expecting some water was called my encouragement and pleased that you have done very good thing for that in me but Abby what for me orgia work for tacos and easier Watford taco he's agile nozzle he is observing everything he knows how we have done it and in his notebook your name has been registered I'm sure if you don't believe then you are you can never become a mom I am working not for anyone but for all the suppose that was the training that was the teaching and in different ways different manners he was telling show me Santa Ruben and the G who passed away he was the second show me so sometimes he also used to Taylor's don't do this this way you should not be that way you should not move in this way every time used to say now this way we have grown up when Swamiji in the Advaita stoma I was a brahmacari he called very loudly hey who is there come down Iran afterwards someone told why he talked like this roughly it'll because there is no time at all but I neighbors thought that it is wrong way he is telling I am NOT raising myself but I am only telling my personal experiences when you are coming over here these I won't name a Swami he is now here in America and he is a mathematician he was a professor in a big University and he joined and the first day the in-charge swami ji asked him to sweep the floor and he sort of sweeping the floor I am able I thought that I will become the principal of this college and now they are asking me to sweep the floor now this is not my place I should leave then he used to go to a very old choix me in Kashi in Banaras sadhu sanga the sea ramakrishna stealing sadhu sanga and that Swami told him a story of another monk not belongs to our ramakrishna mission he used to live somewhere nearby there was a shiva temple He is God his deity every morning no one asked him but he is to sweep the whole road so nicely so that the devotees will be coming afterwards they should not be hard and he is to keep everything ready so that they can wash their hands they can do the puja but he won't look at the devotees he will turn his face on the other distant direction and seat over there meditating and whatever the devotees will leave that used to eat he told this love for your own ideals love for your ideal and you are sacrificing yourself volunteering nobody is forcing you is the volunteering and now if you expect that this should be done that should be done for you you are not a volunteer you are not dedicating you are working in exchange something you are accepting so you won't get their blessings of God and this Ramachari he remembered the story immediately from the next day onwards he said that Xiaomi used to do so much for unknown people and here they are all the monks and bromwich airings of the Ramakrishna order and they live in these rooms and this is the veranda there's a passageway that I have to clean I must clean they asked him to sweep the he is to see the whole area in because that inspiration how it came sadhu sundar see this sadhu sanga the two lucida asks is telling Tata swarga appelberg asuka Daria Tula a conga to Lana netaji sakala milli geo su colaba satsanga satsanga that is though if you're weighing is more heavier than the happiness of the heaven and we find that see Ramakrishna in his very simple way he said shadow Shango holy Tobit karana hai understanding become very clear when you are having a holy company that is called holy company so what is the effect of holy company understanding becoming very clear and what is that understanding why and how why I am coming to the temple why I am going to the church why I am going to the mosque why I am coming to a holy place that why am i coming over here to get some other benefits some name fame these and they're okay then it's all right for spiritual development how DC sadhu sanga understanding becomes clear what is God see look at these I was feeling really sorry this gentleman is so sincere is started so seriously for last 30 years but understanding is not clear and it's very difficult than the first time I'm meeting him so only I told see one thing only i will tell you please ask yourself when you are alone why you are trying this what is the goal just to control your mind so that you can control others mind to get some benefit of the miraculous power why you were meditating 30 35 years he said no almost 40 okay 40 years but why this is the first thing and then comes how unnecessarily why you should do these and that lovingly we should do whatever we should do lovingly and if you are not giving lovingly then it is of no use is of no use under some compulsion you are giving as the Ramakrishna went to that house and that the compulsion they gave but ceramic is not blessed them and he was teaching and through this as we are reading the gospel we are learning cool arden of Tantra is telling say Tom Sango he is Adam Saddam Sangha Saddam means the holy company sat satsanga Saddam Sangha vishayam that is the great medicine medicine for what mental suffering whatever the mental suffering is there it will go away so clearly all these things then he said about the knowledge what is that knowledge clear idea about the goal of life or the knowledge clear idea about the goal of life clear idea about why and how then he says talking about the devotion what is the devotion liking for God and good not only liking for God liking for good I like God but at the same time I don't like this man that percent these and that constantly criticizing no rather you have to develop you see look at this how they are maintaining again in the Vancouver they were telling I told you are all good people you are maintaining for last 40 45 years Shami be wakin on the landed over there from India from Bombay she say he sailed and then landed over there first time and every year they are observing that the Vivekananda came wonderful actually is do you think this is something very small thing no you are paying from out of your pocket and naturally wherever you go if you ask how many members more than done Drake how many comes less than 10 always there will be very less people when will be function when there will be a big Swami acid our analogy is going it will be very difficult to get a seat over there all people will go but when there is no one you are going and cleaning and suffer making it all right and then sitting before the god offering little water and switch to God that is called liking for God and good so good things also you have to appreciate all the time Allah what is that love lovies attachment to God the love is attachment to God these are all my definition so when I am talking about the knowledge my i define in this way is a clearer idea about the goal of life devotion liking for not only God for good to love attachment to God you cannot leave without God so that is attachment and then naturally the moment you are a test with the God comes the renunciation I don't want anything else whatever comes the dissipation why should I have to take so many things not misery so that then comes a bit dia this is all big desmaya evita what is that OB DIA a wig demeans just oppose it when there is God there is world right and the world what is the air ruper Russia subtus partial ganda so a big demeans the ramakrishna say attraction for the five saints objects that's all and the Brahma devotee is asking again now another question is it good to worship God with form an image of the deity made of clay again and again people ask this question in so many damn times and so many places say Ramakrishna answers well devotee do not seek clay in the clay image true image he connects his mind with the higher consciousness he is looking at this picture but it's not seeing the picture you know that famous story that happened in the life of swami vivekananda he was also as a young man influenced by the Brahma he was of not visiting the Kali temple never looking at the image of cali when afterwards coming in contact with synonym see Ramakrishna he understood everything then when after the passing away of see Ramakrishna he was going in different places of India in rajasthan one minister requested him will you please come to our the King King is good but he is mixing with too much with the British errs and slowly slowly started hating all the things that we are having now he is telling all the images that we are having in the temples are very bad now King telling that images are not good than the subjects naturally out of fear don't go there can you please come because just by seeing you I am convinced that you will be able to make our King convinced about their swami vivekananda very always his courageous and awe and ready to accept this type of challenges even and when the King acts like that immediately he said at the two questions very famous their King said show me you speak so wonderful English you were educated why you were wasting why you were wondering like this as a monk Swami's answer was from a Vivekananda being a king all the team time you are spending your time with the British shirts going for hunting and pressure making why you are not taking care of your subjects have you ever visited them then he was taken aback and because sandy she is not afraid of anything and he told the truth on his face then again he said I don't believe in image worship what is your idea Shami she told would whose picture is this it is his father's picture maharaja passed away bring it down and he asked that minister spit on this everyone was taken about what you are talking about splitting on the picture of the Rajah in the king who where is Raja it is only a paper and some painting in those days there is no camera so someone only painted this is some painting and rock the paper where is Raja King understood and Shami ji said look at this they have so much of respect for you and your father the Kings that your image your picture brings them in their mind not the paper not the ink but you your father so similarly when you look at the image of the god or goddess you don't see clay you see the God through it so that was the answer and how does one cultivate the spirit of fashion here Saddam o Krishna is talking with this man but in his mind dispassion how you will understand so cinema Krishna is giving a different answer long back when we were preparing to get the sannyasa you know the ramakrishna mission you have to be nine years Ramachari that means wearing a white cloth and some type of training you have to go and then paint here if you have a good record then only the president sharmaji gives sannyas so a two or three of us innovate Osama bromwich errands we were ordained fraud and we'll be good you're ready getting ready to go to balloon mod today waiting over there like this ranganathan and the G came then we asked him Swamiji please tell us something about the sannyasa life and he was always inspiring huh then he said only those who wear indras in their past life can become a good sannyas in this life then what is why Indra endure is the king of gods though obviously whatever you want you can enjoy so all the enjoyment when you are already enjoyed satisfied not at all craving for all these things then you can become very good sannyasi so that is why the ceramic ISNA is also telling dispassion is not possible unless there is satisfaction through enjoyment so when you have enjoyed then see Rama Krishna himself he saw all people are praising and they are looking to those sometimes the rich people the gym endures the landlords they are smoking hubble bubble made of silver and then they'll be is lying on their one side and then in the second and the halfway there he acts motor Babu can you please bring the same thing for me I like to practice like the German ders I'd like to see how the Hubble bubble smoking I will double in that way give me joy then he in the left side it took gobble gobble and smoke and the right we smoke lying on his back lying on his belly everything then afterwards he said to his own mind mind this call having Hubble bubble smoking Hubble gobble in the gym in dar way in the landlord's way is all painful it is nothing special so when a person is going inside the five-star hotel he sees everything is same like our rooms a little bigger little nicely caved that's all and nothing else so naturally after visiting all these places and seeing all these people then you can understand vanities of vanity Rami he said nothing is there what is there actually joy within peace with in love with in wherever you are all people are there talking with you they are respecting you and they are all your own wherever you are known unknown and that is joy all alone living in one room and there is nobody to talk to how much you'll be texting nobody is replying back so huh so naturally after some time you are tired how many times in how many movies you can see and most of the movies you have already seen twice thrice are tired so it leaves only one thing that is your own mind and if you are joyful sitting nicely closing your eyes sending your mind to God and just going round along with ceramic East and Marsha Radha here and there of the Duchy nature or the different the places of pilgrimage you go the holy company you are talking meeting you see how much joy in that wherever you see it quietly you are sending your mind to somewhere where you can enjoy and you will see the joy that's why this is the spiritual knowledge we should have to a spiritual knowledge impossible without a guru there's a very interesting question is asking most of the people they'll be asking the do we really needed guru why because when they see the guru let me tell you if the ramakrishna mission our system is in india and nearby areas only president mahajan vice president mara like the japan and then singapore our centers are there but those Swami's cannot give initiation only our president Mirage and vice versa in my heart there are three vice president one president the only give initiation to naturally the lot of crowd and those people they know what is initiation so they will be all coming and is a big list there will be interviews so after that only why you are coming for initiation here in the Western countries like America london france etc the schwab is in charge can give initiation so naturally people are lazy when they calm what is initiation we give the name of God how come that I can give suddenly and nobody else I went to Baylor what all the Swami's who have been empowered to give initiation went to build a lot and they were empowered by the proper authority that is President Mirage and there is the parampara you cannot give any mantra you have to give according to the system so that is all the parampara so when I am giving the initiation as a human being I am the Guru but in reality see Rama Krishna is the Guru after giving the mantra all gurus they say God now she is yours and or he is your your child your children you have to take care so that is the way salam o Krishna giving the answer they'll win they are asking is spiritual knowledge impossible without a guru wonderful way see Ramakrishna's giving the reply shut chidananda alone is the Guru such cheat Ananda that means Brahman he is not telling God history sachidananda who is God that sachidananda is taking the form of God out of his own will that satchitananda again taking the form of the guru Sri Ramakrishna is explaining sachidananda alone is the Guru if a man in the form of a guru awakened spiritual consciousness in you then know for certain that it is God absolute who has assumed the human form for your sake we don't practice that guru puja in many other places they'll be asking the Guru that particular person will be sitting and the Indian Way they'll be washing the feet and offering the puja as they do to the deity so the living gods and goddesses they do in our case we don't do that here it is the god only the Guru and what we do at least I practice always to discuss about the Guru and that is more than official and then singing the glory of the Guru Guru because who is removing the darkness is it possible for any human being to do that he can inspire you and guide you he can somehow help you to go that way but the ultimate thing depends on the god so the Guru is also praying Sri Ramakrishna is telling if a man in the form of a guru awakened spiritual consciousness in you then know for certain that it is God the absolute who has assumed the human form for your sake and that's why they always say don't be so close to the Guru maybe that you will see the human in him you should not try to see that when we took the inner ramakrishna mission guru is very difficult to go near the president moraga very difficult to go near them even if you had but these to say look from distance and remember the picture remember that image and when you are meditating meditate that from the distance but if you go close and sometimes people make mistake we're thinking who he is just like an ordinary person he is behaving like these behaving like that so there is a mistake so it is better to be in distance in the human form rizal is that may be there and here we are the administrator the minister in charge in the president of the organization I have to take care of many other things I am asking somebody not to do these asking somebody to do these two there is a chance the person may make wrong conception so that is there so whatever I am thinking that person is not understanding so this is the very very interesting question and the answer we should understand only God is the Guru why he can remove what is the meaning of the Guru removal of darkness will be observing the Guru that the puja is coming but in a very humble way no special pooja bhatt known food will be there why because will be you know the whenever people are coming and they are assembling together and discussing about God and then afterwards when they go away all alone no again they should go and have some food and that was introduced by sehran Krishna himself mother was so happy to feed others and the first manager of the volute ahmad shah me Prime Ananda g he was also used to feel to call people and give some food when you are taking some food and which has been offered to God and praying with the prayer that will surely give the benefit to become your mind purified whether you understand it or not same food which you can purchase in the shop perhaps we have purchased from the shop and brought over here bar offered to God with a prayer and giving it to you so that is consecrated food is always good but with devotion you have to and you are nourishing the body and at the same time you have to pray constantly please God nourish my mind also you will observe here we don't have monks so naturally bandura is not there and it is the tradition is a bundoora when the 50 monks came here I introduced this word in the Ganges some they were telling ho people don't understand Mandarin not now but they will understand it afterwards but let me introduce this word pandara because they will learn what do they do usually here in the ramakrishna mission we take it casually but traditional way if you go as long as they are eating they'll be going on chanting from different scriptures some from gita to some from Bhagavad some from Ramayana some from somewhere all the time chanting is going on this person that person why you know nourishing the mind when you are taking the Prashad you are nourishing the body but oh god I need this strength of the body but don't send my mind to the body I want to get out of it I am I'm the self and the soul I am all-pervading I am pure so nourishing the mind constantly listening to those type of sutras goes on and on so that is why in that the sadhu Gandara so that is the system why unless early they're chanting some people they ask there is not unnecessary this is not is necessary so we should not talk about any other things when we are taking food so that is the Guru constantly in every stay wavery where they will be asking the devotees and the followers this is good for you and this is not good for you so this is what ceramic ISNA is telling and then afterwards this the master ceramic ISNA having a conversation with someone who was conducting a puja a prayer with the Brahmas and this conversation we will read and listen in our next class let us conclude with offering the pranaam to god though he is the personal God but at the same time we always think believe that impersonal takes the form and then comes to us so near engine Omni tiem on entire bum bak tonneau
