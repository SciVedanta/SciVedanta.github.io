[231: Panchama Veda 231 : Sri Ramakrishna and Buddha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBX5F5NQt2A)

dear devotees and friends let us begin our Pancham Aveda today with this chanting Tabo khatam rhythm Tata G Bonham Kobe read item Calma shop aha Shravan among golem srimad Artem booby green tea buried arjuna and this today we'll be reading from the Gospel but I don't know whether it'll be possible as because the tomorrow is a May 7th his buddha purnima and according to the chicago timing this evening we shall discuss about the two great spiritual luminaries and that one is Raghav on Sri Ramakrishna and another is the Gautama Buddha the dis dear avataras and both of them the God advented in the human form and very unique Lord Buddha advented two hundred thousand five hundred years before then Ramakrishna so this is the time difference two thousand five hundred years the Lord Buddha was born nearly six hundred years five to six hundred years before Jesus so that is him to believe that the Supreme God the Creator he takes human form and Advent into his own creation to prove those truths revealed by him through the words of the Veda and to put the human being on the right track of the righteousness the avatar on the god is coming taking the human form and why because the truth that he has revealed in the pure hearts of the Rishi's which they have recorded they have given us so that is called the Vader the revelation of the truths the sometimes people they misunderstand that and also not only that they misinterpret the Hindu except that be de aquila Dharma Muallim the Veda is the base of all religions Akilah all religions okay ARIMA moolam is the base but sometimes the misunderstands and misinterpretation and they utilize those teachings for their selfish benefits also dues at the time when the God is ad venting in the bhagavad-gita also if I the God Shri Krishna he is promising that that is the time two thousand five years before Hindus believe the Lord God came as Gautama Buddha and two thousand five years after he came as Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna so today we will will not go into the life of these two people most of us we know but will try to see the communalities at the same times little differences both Lord Buddha and Sri Ramakrishna came with one mission Bojana Hidayah Bahujan Asha kya the good for many and the happiness of all that was their goal when the Lord she dr. gautam up the was born in lumbini a forest situated that at present-day India Nepal border the socio-political situation was completely different then see Ramakrishna's we can understand 2005 grains years before and there was the India was completely different it is ruled by the kings who were actually guided by the Rishi's and who were enlightened by the Vedic knowledge so it was all same time Sanskrit was the main language economy was wonderful people were very happy everything was going on in that we win Buddha game and see Ramakrishna was born in 19th century peculiarly the religion philosophical system are almost as them they're the social differences is where social and political we can understand when the ceramic issue was born India was ruling by the British and that the it was under the subjugation of the British ours and before the British are so many other foreign rulers scheme shock own partner and mogul in the language of the ravine wrath one after another and the Europeans also but see Ramakrishna he was in a completely different socio-political condition but the was different but this is really wonderful if we notice it that religio-political system are almost the same why because in the sheiter shuttle Upanishad will go to the quick quote from there the shatter shatter Upanishad it says Kim Karan am Brahma see how this Indian mind it works kim carnem grandma is Brahman is the cause of creation that is the first question second otice mojit Allah who has created us how we are born kudos mojo da G bar machina how we are surviving who has created us and how we are surviving capture some pratishta what is our goal of life the four questions that the shutter Upanishad it raised then they analyzed then they got the reply and all those things we find that the same thing was there a time of Buddha and at the time of Sri Ramakrishna this is India eternal India the main thing is the same the society is changing but the actual philosophical ideology is not changing at all thousands of years the Lord Buddha was also thinking in the same way see Ramakrishna in the same way and here is the commonality that a common thing common basis asking about the truth so in it is there because of the boy dick teaching which governed the Indian social life remain unchanged Buddha was born in a king's family and sadhana Krishna was born in a humble Brahmin family but if you notice both of them learned ethics and morality as per the Vedic tradition September the dharmam Chara these are the Vedic tradition these are the you must tell the truth and you must practice your religion that means your responsibility your duties properly and different people are having different responsibilities duties in this social life they must perform that then you must respect the seniors and they give in that way they taught in this way Matra de Beauvoir the mother is the goddess pitri devo bhava acharya des Baux at ETD boo the teacher is our God and and the guest is our God Shami vivek and added afterwards in the modern society that it drew de beauvoir more Khedive abba so you have to consider each and every one is nothing but the manifestation of the same God and you have to respect by that way you become humble it is the ego that creates all problem we suffer because of our ego we think we will enjoy no job exactly oppose it the more we are humble the more we learn from others so both of them the Lord Buddha who was a prince he learned all this boy dick the systems of teachings cinema Krishna also do we use a poor Brahmin boy right from the childhood they had philosophical bent of mind we see the Buddha though his father was very careful because the they were announced the all the Brahmins would came and they saw his particular time of birth and all calculated and they announced that this man is this boy is going to be Jataka he is either going to be a big king a Supreme Commander or he will be a great monk for the first option the father who was thinking that it will be good because he was also a king so he wanted his son is should also be king but for the second option he was afraid if my son become monk then what will happen so naturally he was trying to we know in the life of Lord Buddha with so famous he was protecting that he should not see the outside but the Buddha wants went out to see the city and he met some people one an very old man he was tottering on his mistake and then at the date man and the brother sannyasi like that and the person who was not well so all this he saw and immediately his philosophical bent of mind started thinking why this what is going to happen to me too afterwards so like that he was thinking but once I Ramakrishna when he was a small little boy used to go to the cremation ground and sit all alone in that terrible place used to sit all alone thinking the why all these what is happening used to look at the sky used to wonder how the things are happening all over the philosophical bent of mind and then it was so deep in the in the mind above on cinema Krishna when he was only six years old or eight years old I think so when he was walking another in the the villages Ringold villages the paddy field and in between the two the paddy field is a small path and he was walking on that and suddenly he saw the green is going and meeting in the horizon and where the sky has come down and in the horizon there's black clouds and the white crane was flying on that the green the black and the white and the vastness that took his mind to a completely different condition and that was his fast samadhi the big and beautiful his mind traveling to that vast and beautiful conception and he fainted over there people thought he's fainted but he was in Samadhi that was his first samadhi buddha also went into deep thought by this time he was married he was having a child and still he could not forget the whole life is temporary each and every one is going to be the and it will be their body will be dilapidated like this and what to do how to go beyond it so this to the philosophical both of them were thoughtful compassionate not at all interested in the worldly pleasure increasing it to know the creator the cause of creation and the way out to go back to the source these are the commonalities that we find in both the minds and they were born two thousand five five hundred years apart to get the answer of this questions neither Buddha nor see Ramakrishna went to any university rather located both of them went and sat under trees and we drawn their senses where is the source of knowledge ourselves and that knowledge is the true knowledge so instead of going to the University to know God what they did they sat under the trees they went to the nature required calm and cool dare they sat we drawn their senses and then peers true all other things in the mind made the mind completely still and that truth revealed both of them did the same thing Buddha sat under Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya on the bank of near Anjana and goddess at under Panchavati at the cynosure on the bank of Ganga the motor of this their meditation were same both of them why do you are meditating with an idea with an ideology with a goal what is that goal how to go beyond misery and achieve eternal peace that was their motto to going beyond the worldly miseries and achieving eternal peace both of them became successful Gautama became Buddha Kidada became Sri Ramakrishna dope personally both were uninterested in worldly matters but it seems due to divine inspirations they were eager to spread their revelations through their teachings we know ceramic ISNA after all this is hard why I have to leave because I know now everything it happened induction Asia and the room that we usually know the ceramic richness room opposite to that there is a building called kuta bali where the landlord used to come and stay and saddam Oh Krishna was allotted a room nice room and dear see Ramakrishna one day he was sitting and he was thinking that I should give up the body because I have realized God I realized Brahman it is of no use now when he was sitting and thinking suddenly from the floor still that room is there from the floor a thick white smoke came up from nowhere and inside the smoke ceramic isness saw a face of a Rishi white here and the white beard a beautiful the eyes he looked at ramakrishna ii and said baba muka tucker three times repeated baba mocha taco remain on the threshold of this world and that world that's called baba mocha is a big discussion on that this is the wonderful experience that the ramakrishna had then he started feeling that he has to do something for the people in the world they are so happy people are happy with the worldly objects externally happy they seem that they are happy the happy like a camel which is chewing it torn and bleed and bleeding and thinking oh it is so tasty it is ezel own blood is chipping the torn that that the way to give the expression the worldly enjoyment his work is nothing so this is the way we must understand so Gautama Buddha also failed the same way he was having a Kingdom a beautiful queen and the son and all his followers devoted followers subjects but he was not ready to go back so these are the two and instead they started delivering their teachings both Buddha and ceramic isne were eager to reach out to the common masses and used their masses dialects Buddha used poly though his mother ma Gaddy with this mother tongue was Magothy but he used the pali language because that was the common language for the almost hold that region see ramakrishna almo of course used Bengalis the Bengali language the Bangla Buddha introduced his disciples and instructed his disciples in this way Oh new john army bhiksha be Sakaya Narok tia Buddha Barnum Perea Pune Tom the Buddha in in that that is the poly I'm trying to pronounce as best as possible oh no John ami bhiksha be amongst you must be instructed in this way as because I am telling you must create my teachings Sakaya Naru Tia Sakai enira TIA the local languages and what is that Buddha Barnum my teachings and this is Maria Pune tomb this is the instruction amongst you must spread my teachings in local languages of course Elana Krishna didn't instruct like the Buddha but his teachings were spreaded by his disciples and admirers in many different languages Buddha was not happy the way the priests were interpreting the Vedas now is Buddha about this there's a beautiful question he's Buddha a Buddhist no he was a Hindu and because he was born in a Hindu family and he was taught through the Indo way and his spiritual guru spiritual instructor was also a Hindu he followed all the boy Deek methods to practice spirituality and naturally all the actions as per the system of the Veda means that he got the revelations of the the Brahman so the knowledge that he got the knowledge of oneness and that is Brahman though he termed it in different way and explained in different way that is the difference but when he saw that the majority of the people in those days at this time they are using karma Condor of the Vida vida is having to be on account and karma kanda karma kanda means this to perform the youngers and all even today there are people who follow the karmic under karma candy they follow the instruction of the bathers which is asking them to perform yoga and all that so they they were doing that but in that he noticed that these people the priests who are performing that it is their livelihood so obviously they are trying to cheat people in the name of religion but the neighbor like that as we find in the life of Jesus Christ also so he was chasing the people in the synagogue the place where the Jewish people they pray the temple of Jewish God in the synagogue Lord Jesus went over there and when he saw the they are sailing religion in the name of you will go to heaven if you give me this much money or hell if you don't like that he became very angry and he took up a stick and chased those people and said you're shouting don't make my father's house a business place he is always of the time there shall me be waken the cinema Krishna day also but in a completely different way but it protected and that is the way the religious reform comes Buddha also protested and he wanted to tell this so he protested people when use religion as the source of in then two things they always use temptation and fear they will tell if you give money like this and perform the younger like these do these do that you will go to heaven you will have this you will have their temptation or otherwise fear you will go to hell you'll be tortured you will have problem you will have pickle teas so the temptation and fear these two things are used in the name of religion to get some money and that is called in the Mahabharata it has been said Dharma be Aparri those who are using that they are the religious merchants they are not religious people so but the protested against this exactly Lord Buddha stressed on self-realization Nirvana and asked people to develop high morality he explained the basis of the creation in Four Noble Truths and he was telling that because of this it is all these things are happening so Four Noble Truths that is very famous what is that very simple though do come truth of suffering and whole life that we see in this world is nothing but touka do come to come sarvam to come like that they say the whole world whole life is nothing but the dukkha and it is the truth its asset you cannot deny it now I'll be happy I am not having any Duker no it cannot be for some form of other the suffering will come sometimes some people they're having money but no health that they are suffering that is their Duker some people are having many other things but children are not obedient dukkha and some people there all the time afraid whatever the position they have occurred and the name fame that will go away duker so any so check out the Carmine the balentine's also same the same way Raghavan see Ramakrishna to jagat mithya had this been cinema krishna sterling had I noticed the world is true permanent I would have completely covered my birthplace come out bucketed ramappa cool with gold by the way he is telling to give the stress and he is telling look at your body what is there the bones the marrow the skins the blood hominid what is there in this body so that is the way always the spirituality it will take your mind away from this world and go to the spirituality the truth and he's telling the dukkha that truth of suffering dukkha samudaya this is a cause of dukkha what is the cause of dukkha what is the cause of suffering it's cistern ha the that is the cause Tana means the desire that is the cause and we also know that what is the desire karmana in the bhagavad-gita are very nicely step by step it says sang God Sanjaya T comma comma crudo variety crew dot Parvati some more some more hearts me to be brown Smitty bump shot booth dinars but dinar shot pronoun Shetty so one step bends first is the shunga you see something and you get attracted to that he'd like to achieve that Happ that begins from there Shang God because of the company Sanjaya T and this the moment it is Sanjaya that the moment it happens and slowly slowly it takes you to very difficult situation where only suffering is waiting for you son God Sanjay Atacama desire the moment you come in contact desire and comet crudo variety if the desire is not fulfilled and anger close out Parvati some more all the teachings that you guard if I'm angry if I'm fighting for these what is going to happen afterwards we forget everything just pounce on that jump on that then the fight and afterwards Buddha nor sharpener Shetty the Buddha the determinative faculty that get lost sometimes some people just for little reason small reason to kill people afterwards all life spending in the behind the bar or getting that some of the countries they hang them they are also killed only one mistake the Buddha begins with that the car and then he said the call dukkha is a desire Raghavan C Ramakrishna he said this jagat is mithya here's a traditional pedantic way he's 8 and he the terminology he used is this this jagat is not true in the truest sense what why it is not true because it is not permanent this is the confusion always we happen whenever the Barrentine are telling the jagat mithya in the booth distilling jagat mithya the kamae the sometimes the people they get confused it is full of misery but sometimes you think that you were happy with the family with the house with the property with the wealth but that also you know that there are the many things are there weep but with which you are not happy so majority of the time we make ourself in such a way force also to think that we are happy but in reality we are not but anyway that is the life but if we are going towards the spiritual life why should you do the true thing what is the truth yes the life is full of misery and it comes very strongly this discrimination this feeling with the samskara there again that is the Hindus the vedantic they will say is of the samskara with the past birth we have done Lord practice spirituality but could not succeed so in the next birth maybe in this life you have come to this condition and you understand this this is all fully all mistake so I'm not going to be bound by that but the worse the cheeks the same thing and it has a it can be removed dukkha nirodha it can be stopped the flow of dukkha can be stopped Nilda it is possible and how do Connie do the mugger and mark mark means the way in the pally the pronunciation is different so do Connie Rhoda and this duker this suffering can be overcome the four steps of the Buddha and that skull Aria chapter ara the Four Noble Truths Satriani dukkha touka-sama daya do kanuda do Connie Rhoda Marga this is the way the Buddha said but once a ramakrishna also he's also going out to people and spreading the message and he is telling again and again but he was having a different way his teaching Lord Buddha he said it in a for the common I don't know whether he said to God ordinary people also not because we will find that after that death of the Lord Buddha when he passed away after some years then his disciples they came together they became very old they were thinking that all the teachings of the Buddha will be lost so let us remember what he used to say they started remembering and then quoted that was not a dog will come to that her chances that people they forgot exactly what would the saint that is the difference here we find the Sri Ramakrishna's in his teaching also again and again he is telling the same way this world that you see is illusory that is a pedantic way is Meeta it's temporary the don't give so much mind to this a little mind is sufficient for that try to put your mind back to God and he gave so many examples also and he was he gave that those who know how the husking machine in the villages the war particularly bengal village and there'll be a heavy wooden thing that is going up and coming down someone is bracing at the back and falling in a small dirt and the temple and there someone is going on changing the rice but that way the to the village ladies and they're very very quick otherwise they will that there will be an accident one lady she is changing their eyes when that the wooden thing is coming down and very strong weight is falling because they have to break the Rises at the same time she's taking care of the baby child and at the same time she is also having then sailing with their customer talking with the customer negotiation is going on about the money and all all the three four works are going but her mind is on the right hand she is using to change that rice giving this example now it is it is not there mostly the Machine have come but giving this examples Ramakrishna is telling see she is doing all the worldly works taking care of the baby and talking with the customer but at the same time her mind is completely on that hand which is turning the rice did that way we can also major portion of our mind can keep on God and it's a small little mind we can work and the to be sufficient for the worldly duties buddha and sri ramakrishna both are denying that the world is a happy place no it is not then the Buddha is giving and it is very famous Eightfold Path and that's called right views right aspiration right speech right action Right Livelihood right endeavor right mindfulness right concentration these are the eight steps and this has all explained in in the beautiful way unbiased view with rigor to all ideas and facts of life and understanding of the doctrine of karma a cause and effect the cause and effect there the karma theory and that is called the right view now unless and until we have the right view we won't be able to understand why one should be careful about the spiritual life the majority of the people may jority of the people am Telling they go to the temple they go to the church or mosque or the synagogue they go for spiritual protection someone is there the God is all-powerful and if we get the protection so then there'll be no suffering that is the main purpose of going to the holy places but that is that should not that is okay but the purpose real purpose should be to go beyond the constant suffering birth and death the circle of birth and death and white is again and again we are taking birth and suffering because of our karma and what is that karma desired to get the enjoyment in this world and all the actions do you do only with that view that we are going to get something from this world there's a mistake the more I get from this world one day we'll go again suffering again I am thinking the more I will get it this way it goes on on and on so that is the way both they are teaching Buddha and Ramakrishna be careful right view then the right admit aspiration attain the high state of perfection where there will be an end of strife and suffering it will be attained during the life of on the on this earth this is an 10 right speech Baksh anjum telling the truth and avoiding slander her speech and foolish blunder so what is all this morality the religion is possible by practicing the morality and the we were reading in the Bhagavata the who can be called as a shadow who is having twenty eight good qualities the good qualities only take us to that level and in the bhagavad-gita also in the sixteenth chapter 26 the number is there you can practice that the Lord Buddha also is telling the right speech right action Right Livelihood and right endeavor right speech win a we are tailing so this is called the sadhana Bach Singham sadhana we just say something and not actually think very deeply why we're telling it was not necessary to tell but we comment and that comment that word makes all different things and we suffer afterwards the people will come and complain why did you say like that so many times happen so many times so this is the way it it goes on one must be careful and how that's called the goddess Kali she's that holding her tongue the same way one should see everything here everything learned everything but when tailing saying must be careful the my speech my world should not hurt others the way I'm expressing should not hurt others that's if we and say that Buddha alsa 2,500 years ago Buddha also stitching the same way where is the Buddhism this unless we practice this there is no reason then I am following the Buddha but not following these teachings the Eightfold paths then right action from restraining from killing stealing and all the right action is also the morality Right Livelihood hardening wants leaving my fear means the master Mercia was to record the conversation of ceramic ISNA once he Oxley Ramakrishna said can I arm a little more for the maintenance of my family the usually the religious people the traditional way they say no no no no you should not work you should give up but Salaam o Krishna he said why you should you should you must try but in the right way not by cheating others are doing something wrong in the society when there is scarcity people are afraid immediately you increase the value of the things is not good or I heard in our country here also maybe in America holding the things so that when the demand will increase they will sail the same thing in a higher price all this not good it may be business but no it cannot be the religious way so one should understand these the Buddha is telling that Right Livelihood right India we're not allowing bad thoughts to arise in the mind see the same thing that we practice the Hindus what the difference the ceramic is me is again and again telling don't allow the bad thought to cross your mind and he is giving the caution to those people who are trying to become spiritual he said even jokingly should not tell the lies his is very favourite disciple Rakhal maharaj who afterwards became the first president of the ramakrishna order swami brahmananda when he came to visit him see ramakrishna he could read the mind of people immediately looked at him and said oh you must have committed something seen some scene you must have committed I can't look at your face so obviously the young boy was scared and said I didn't do anything nothing no just remember remember remember then he remember I told something which is not true but that was joking I was talking with my friend jokingly I said then see Ramakrishna say even jokingly you are trying to realize God you're trying to be spiritual you should not even jokingly till the false thing don't tell the lies even jokingly that is the morality that one should practice and that is exactly Raghavan Buddha is also telling and right mindfulness developing quali quality of awareness our prophet the Baba Buddha used to say again and again right mindfulness Raghavan see Ramakrishna those were and reading the gospel of ceramic isne they can immediately understand all these things are so common between both Buddha and ceramic isne he is also telling that you should not allow your mind to go into the samsara always try to keep away sometimes you should be observing your own mind and that is mindfulness you must observe your mind what the mind is thinking where he is it is going what type of thoughts are crossing your mind and right concentration meditation is absolutely necessary that is also the teachings of sri ramakrishna meditation you must meditate meditate used to inspire his young disciples to go and meditate so this is the Eightfold Path that Buddha was protesting the Met hearts that were used and he gave a different type of philosophy what philosophy the he was giving the stress on the spiritual development so that is the difference between the monk and the priest the priest is also religious he is also practicing a righteous path and all but that is his livelihood so obviously their way of explaining the God and religion will be different from the monk monk doesn't leave on that so that is the difference when the priest is telling and when a devotee has gone if the priests say you can do the puja yourself it doesn't matter at all how his family will survive that is the reason this is the two different things but the protesting about the priestly craft and priestly hood not against the Hinduism that's why Shami be back on this date but build child of Hinduism but there is a rebelled child of Hinduism Ramakrishna also found people at in that way in that religion but Ramakrishna's times it was little different what is the difference the Buddhist time it was all Vedic religion but the stress was on karma kanda the more on the work portion of you yaga yaga and with that they were extracting money from the kings like that and he protested thing is that but the Salama Krishna's time it was different by that time in India a different groups came with their own culture and religion so the Islam then Christianity and it was already there and the Buddhism was already there the serrano krishna stressed on samanya the Buddha didn't stressed on samanya with the only said the right path you should follow and get liberated from here Nirvana but cinema Krishna he was completely dear they differ ceramic Ishta was concerned about the other paths also the people they were boasting they were fighting and they are thinking that their paths only the truth but that way the ignorant people but egoistic people they were criticizing the other followers other paths constant conflicts were there the cinema Krishna the God who revealed in the form of the Rama Krishna his teaching was little different mostly the samanya so if we go in this way cinema Krishna also is telling in the almost the same Eightfold Path what is that only God exists and nothing else is sure shutter jagat mithya asure shut up the God does exist I promise to you again and again is telling God only God exists world is the manifestation of the God the creation of God then he said hold on to the truth shut toki Tori taco in his Bengali he said hold on to the truth what is the truth in our life in the beginning we should have September da as in the traditional pedantic teaching you must tell the truth what is the truth exactly what you have seen or heard you must tell that much but it's so difficult if you are telling something you'll find that something else are the added because your imagination your explanation your view on that particular happening also added while you are giving the report to someone else very typical so you have to be detached from that whatever you have seen exactly you report whatever you have heard exactly you should report the religious people those who are trying to be religious there should be very very careful in that hold on to the truth that is called Satya and in the ultimate sutta means God why Satya it never changes hear the word such a means something which is unchangeable that that is called Satya that because it is not changing hold to that or is that a common word is God hold to the God all paths are leading to the truth this is the very special edition of Bhagwan see Ramakrishna no one before said like this all the revelations there are realized people that they came and they are very famous and that there are millions of followers of those but they never said all paths and leading to the goal dc's the God who came in the form of sri ramakrishna and this is his main mission all paths leading to the same goal because he knows that I am here and all are coming to me in the bhagavad-gita also shri krishna said whoever in whatever manner worshipping are all coming to me yet about proper don t come study by yamaha mama Bert Manu Burton tea and Shabbat Salva Shara this is the window bhagavad-gita also this is the truth Salam Krishna stressed on this someone named so he's main purpose was following all paths and then discovering the all paths are true if you are sincerely following the paths that we discussed about the Buddhism or the Buddha said that also same leading to the same place and then he said the very famous almost everyone discussed on these have the holy company shadow Sangha what is a sadhu sanga now we are having the sadhu sanga we are discussing about the higher spiritual values and the difficulties of it the paths that can lead lead to this so this is called sadhu sanga satsangha satsangha or sadhu sanga holy company that always lead our mind to a higher spiritual life and higher spiritual life means always going beyond this worldly life worldly towards worldly cravings worldly desires that is called high spiritual so how we can get it from those people those who have already gone beyond this so they can give dex their shared their experience sadhu sanga and leave in solitude nujin Abaza this is very essential as the Buddha is also telling the proper meditation mindfulness that is Canadian Barcia and he would go to the solitude all alone and then everyday give some time just sitting under a tree and then try to read your own mind what the mind is thinking what the mind is thinking follow the mind in the near jhana in the quiet brightness when you are alone when there is no that phone or the any company all alone without even the help of any book just you were do yourself you and your mind that is Canadian Barcia so you'll know about yourself note it down what are the thought crossing what are the fear is there what are the desires are there if you can note it down immediately then after some time you can consciously eradicate something that these are not necessary and you will find slowly slowly you are going to only one agenda the god realization that is that is the benefit of the knee region Marcia living in the solitude then discrimination this is bechara what is the bechara all these things are temporary what is the use of these temporary things brother let us go to for the permanent which is God which is the pure soul which is the source of joy and happiness and then as because we develop the faith the existence of God then pray to that that supreme power through that supreme power which has created us and we are nothing but that just in between there is only one wall is there the wall of the ego break this wall I am trying my best to break this world oh God also please help me to break this wall and then March with you so that is the and Buddhist teachings would the neighbor published in a book he never wrote a book Salaam o Krishna also never wrote any book and Buddhist teachings how it came is known as Tripitaka 3 means 3 Peter Kerr means basket the three basket full in those days days to keep all the valuable things in the basket so the basket the three basket when the Buddha was there nobody recorded when Saddam hawkish na was master mache recorded but would delete for forty years and all his teachings see Ramakrishna and the fifty years he passed away so obviously and the record that we find also very very small why master marsha whose to go to him and he had the habit of noting down everything every conversation everything that he saw he had that habit then that's why he was recording ceremony encouraged him salam o krishna himself in Kara's damn Salameh Kristin used to ask him whether you have write properly and not explained that thing properly or not so Ramakrishna kilometer is a record of four years only and that too when master Mushin he was there some other time as to measure wind he was not there nobody has recorded a little bit here and there so we can say the gospel of C Ramakrishna C Ramakrishna Gautham Rita is the main source book of ceramic isness teaching of course the master Dada Moni Debby Shama Vivekananda and Shawnee brahmananda they have also different places different time revealed those truth that has ultimate recorded to maintain gospel of the Rama Krishna which we study and Tripitaka Tripitaka in the fast all these monks may be after say a 2025 years or maybe little more they gathered in one place and some of them and this discussed that Buddha's teaching will be lost because we are becoming old we will die and everything will be lost dear in the fast the rajagaha they made and bhikshu Ananda who was very close to Lord Buddha he memorized the teachings of the Lord Buddha and it is known as sutra pitaka then another victual another monk is Upali he was also very close to the Buddha he could memorize another set of the teachings of Buddha there's called benaiah potaka and that card Peter girl is the philosophy is a latter Edition so to the disciples our blood Buddha direct disciple bhikshu Ananda and which you Upali they gave the two things and second came
