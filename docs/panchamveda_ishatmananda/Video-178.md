[179: Panchama Veda 179 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng3E2XjMm8w)

today we'll be studying the gospel of sedimentation the June 25th 1884 that account before that as usual let us jump this mantra target on rhythm dr. G Bonham to be rewritten Calma shavon shavon among three Madonna thong Bobby green and EE bodied our general nurse Ramakrishna had the habit of visiting some of the relief spiritual people educated people of those days in that locality why for two things I feel there is to go to see you whether that person has advanced in spirituality or not and second to help him if he is not to help him and guide him to make progress in spirituality Salaam o Krishna the speciality that we see is only the realization only the effort to realize God nor the things the intellectual and this literally and all those things he never paid any importance in those things art is okay but as because the human life is short we do not know when we will die and we do not know whether in our next birth get the human life or not and also we do not know even if we get the human life whether we'll get this type of opportunities or not the few of us who are trying to understand to realize the God just trying may be curious that much evil then is a very small group among so vast the human population and this small group who are interested to realize God to know God to go beyond the circle of birth then they try to understand this very difficult thing the Maya and this the world with everything but temporary these type of things that they are trying to understand for being God is coming to protect them and to guide them to help them so Saddam operation is the God Himself in this modern age he came and he practiced all those what did he practice today morning I was talking with another person who is trying to realize God spiritual practicing then see right from the beginning as because he was studying every Sunday the fall of Adam when the Brahma is creating his mind gone son is just creating something and immediately after the creation they said thank you sir now I am going to go back to the source they're not interested at all in this world why the mind was tuned like that then slowly slowly Brahma increased the ego and the ego separated from God and then we started thinking all these things in the world that we can enjoy only with the five senses only the five objects and we are so full of it I do not care about God also but recently I was reading a book and with the air the one for me he he was sitting and the bird one person came and told said you had a great renouncer then he said what have I renounced I am only renounced these temporary things but you have renounced the permanent thing that is God for the temporary so in a name sarcastic away he was telling but we have to understand this a temporary for that training is necessary so their understanding is necessary and the beginning of the journey begins with the good kind and here we find Bhagavan serum vishna and very simple person never ever quoting some difficulty ratures never telling some typical things to practice very simple but very straightforward and yet and he is now today this June 25th 1884 is a witness day he has it was a ratha-yatra thing the Hindus the grape festival even in those days in Calcutta and others lung tissue was induction Isha he was doing to Calcutta and he found that the boys young boys they're playing music and all those things enjoying that is not a yachtie but what is the righto yeah this is also very significant but rata means the chariot and the God is sitting on the chariot and either the people are dragging that all the horses but that is the significant than that that is the speciality of the Hindus everything they have been a symbolic and this body is the chariot and all my five senses are the horses and the mind is the rain that is and if the dream controlled by someone inside is not properly handling this horses will go amok and may make the problem so the first thing is the mind ceramic isness come out from his - Nisha temple garden house and going to Calcutta if you can imagine that from the Himalayan gave a wonderful thought moving towards cities and the people what not at all understanding that what is going to happen I saw a picture ever shot of moving somebody was taking when the tsunami came and when the huge water that was coming all people who are taking the picture not understanding what danger is coming and within a minute or so they were nowhere it exactly the same paper tsunami is coming in our life but we are not aware at all we are so happy so many wonderful things are happening they were all going on taking the photo because the boats are on the on the top of the waves and the very happy we are saying no you're not so that is exactly wrong business come out and he is going to meet one per deal and the name of the pundit was and that was traditionally educated person until traditionally educated a shooter a target chudamani twerker that disgruntled the debating is very very difficult they will go on arguing for these these these these very difficult and he was the top most of that to Romani that was the certificate that he passed to Shahada he was his name and target Romani and he was staying in the neighborhood neighborhood where ition was their mission was the disciple as a supporter of coca and Saddam wished to Saddam kishna came to Isha and he is pained one or two hours over there then the permian give the time now we are constantly praying to God please come another fun day when the God was trying to meet him he said no come out after four o'clock so ceramic is the God he was waiting to go to him now that he came and along with him came the hodja hodja hodja also he was also he used to think himself as a scholar and in the scripture so he accompanied the master and other prominent scholars also they represent the devotees were present and these devotees and the scholars this to follow the tantric mode of worship and shri the Isha and son he was also present he was a Master notice that the tantric worshipper has a per million mark on his forehead usually people that do in the in South Indian people homeless in the temple itself it'll be there so they go and mark and these the ladies that will take the rain wander James will take the white like that and he serrano krishna jokingly stealing I see he's branded that means he has already branded himself for only one path that his tanta is not ready to accept in the other part the cinema krishna is given that he you should not be like there then we go to this the neuringer and all other scheme nor in the started singing in those days we always find the gospel of the ramakrishna again and again this this type of group constantly following Saddam Rita wherever Susannah Christian is going particularly whenever he's visiting Kolkata they appear and they like to listen to these conversations and sometimes they would be singing the young Narendra who became up towards Shani Vivekananda he was a good singer he was singing the Sri the he was just taking he was master man Slava Krishna was asking him master Marik what is your idea about the most essential thing in life because he's a lawyer is a intelligent person the cinema Krishna is asking what is your idea about the most essential thing in life 3ish he's linked God exists and he alone does everything say he was an intelligent person he read it and he had at least at least as I understood it do not realized it properly understood so he is mentioning God exists and he alone does everything he means adding but the attribute will ascribed to him age capital are not the right ones the God is powerful God is omnipotent God is omniscient God is all merciful all these attributes that we give is not necessary but he is doing everything and he is there how can a man conceive of him his nature is infinite now his knowledge the way is speaking his knowledge we can understand God is infinite and naturally we cannot understand him because our idea is finite the small how can I think of God and if we cannot think of God how can he say that he is all merciful all-powerful give me them anymore he may be not Salam o Krishna is telling what need is the air of your cow holding the number of trees and branches of an orchard see here as I was stating and we I always feel Sahar Krishna he never wants to spend any time for many other information don't waste time straight away because the decision has been taken God is the only real deal permanent being now the Allah is God how do you realize come with this morning we were discussing how to the others go very simple just redraw your mind from the world and you dear let's go the moment we draw the mind from the worldly things and what are the worldly things only fight from the eye we go and we see from the smell the information that we collect and we words that we hear the sound that we hear and the touch and the taste these are not the five things nothing else maybe we can see that so many things but actually it is all right now shortlisted at this age shortlisted only five we have to withdraw those five things we don't like we don't want how do we draw mind if you stop the mind even the eyes are going seeing but not registering because the mind is not activated and what is the right reflection of the consciousness so this way back calculation if we go towards that we go to the source and what is the ultimate team consciousness where it is within us how it is reflected on the mind and what is the mind very subtle thing that is already there reflected by the consciousness and that is why all these things are happening now if we understand me we believe I am using two words understanding and believing the faith and also the reasoning if by this - if we come and God is there and how to reach back only to stop taking this Ramakrishna stilling what need is there you're counting the number of trees and branches in an orchard you have come to the orchard to eat mangoes do that and be happy when you go to Michigan in that our friend will the village and the villages if said I've never visited but many of our devotees they have gone nearby the neighbors they have grown up the orchards you can go I can plot this apples many other things and then PA come back now if you go on Counting oh you are done' how many trees you are having and it will be late so you won't be able to plug the the fruits you can come for that purpose pluck it pay and come back so that pulses these why unnecessarily to waste so this is the reason we should not waste our time by reading this book and that book hundreds of books are there thousands of books out there if we go on reading no heed and ultimately the eight will come when I will understand I have understood anything so this is the thing truth is there it is not changing we may call it as god or paragon or Allah or 0ba whatever it means truth is there we can reach to that truth however we draw in our mind how do we draw the I asked this as possible utilize this world and this is the way what need is there of your knowing the infinite qualities of God you may discriminate for millions of years of our God's attributes and still you will not know them the master remained silent a few minutes Abram main pundit came into the room then again the master is telling there is no substance whatsoever in the worldly life is very clearly his mentioned there is no substance for swimmer in the worldly life the members of Asians families are good so he has son BC and now he is in the kitchens vanity so he is telling that they are good the wife the children so young the devotee is a some peace suppose his sons had been in a different time disobedient addicted to drink and other vices then there would have been known into his troubles that's true and we all understand that again and again I received a phone call from a mother from the next neighboring state and she said today the police's autistic my son this is a very good boy I don't know why the police arrested him none mr. Caprice noticed something he has done but anyway I can't say that to mother I always said see I cannot do anything else except prayer prefer your son but try to tell him not to do all those things for which the law is coming and arresting him but he won't understand and the problem of the mother mother cannot give up the son for us or her son he has been arrested we don't bother I go on receiving almost all the moms and maybe many other they are receiving the emails a mother is going on writing from India my son was a great scientist and he was in store and now they have arrested him he's in the prison you must please help me we do not know what has happened so we cannot do anything except praying think of it the lady is so happy when she got married and one one young lady whom I was supporting all through and today morning she rang me entered trauma she will be very happy my family members they have found a suitable boy for me maybe if I will marry him so happy a dream and then afterwards children then afterwards that this thing happened at the end of the life disease so whole life after that what we experienced with the what Saddam Edition instilling the substance whatsoever in the worldly life no substance so understanding these very certain one comes across a religious family that is the lucky things husband and wife both are trying to the is God both are supporting each other understanding each other that is the lucky thing so he is telling I have seen only two or three such families Solano Krishna in his life history I have seen two or three such families even the master Hodja who is recording his book was having trouble in the family I deeply admire Oh mother toward my mind at once from the warning from the world to God now this is the Braille at once right this moment don't wait turn my mind from the world to God what is the world temporary things constantly and it was the god permanent we will come up to that then one gentleman he was sitting over there he is telling and the question if this thing was going on in this city why should you select that self the Scriptures they are appreciating the life of the householders in the scripture it is there and it says gesture as Rama Islanders life as the gesture are strong gesture means the highest the best asama means the condition of the life there are four different conditions one is students like Brahma Jaya then comes the guard sir third is the Barnabas the retired life and forties sannyasa the completely dedicated to God now these four stages three are depending only one on one what is that the house of his life the student he needs them support from the house the students who are joining to our the spiritual retreat we take only one-fourth of the charges welcome then we get the money so they come in that way the young people they'll be sharing the the vehicle and like that and like that so they're depending on the support of the others either society's paying government in Spain universities are paying or the parents are paying then the retired people in those days particularly in our country until now retired people mean society have to support or someone show support that's why the children do support the parents like that here of course some other systems are there and when the sannyasi who are even of everything to completely depending on the society and whom the society means the householder so the gist arras drama that is the highest but at the same time this is the problem yes it is true some distance to me it is true but it is difficult to lead the true life of a householder who can be an householder now constantly thinking of God and whatever the work that the householder is doing he's in the evening he is giving it to God what if the response that you gave me Oh God I found now I give this to you then he goes and to the paid next morning he comes up again is doing now so many different varieties of duties the army the mill tree the Polish and at me raishin the lawyer the doctors so many even the business people and there are so many varieties of professions so many varieties of problems in that you have to go on thinking of God it's not so easy we are here completely segregated we don't go out and mix in the society even then we are having problems we sometimes forget God and sometimes the outcomes the God he is the error not otherwise why the problem suddenly in the morning when you open the tab and there is no water think of it they were going to call immediately one devotee you were then and this has happened they devoted tool okay we connected so these things another problem we forget about God meditation constantly thinking about the water supply so this way so there are other problems are also there so death cinema Krishna stilling is it is true but it's difficult to read the true life of the householder now the time has come for a plot master now going to that house and he was sitting in a carriage though it is not very far but his he was very frail body so he couldn't walk so they put him in a carriage and they were all walking and sedan Krishna the moment he entered into the carriage and he was going over there he went into Samadhi and that means his whole mind is now concentrating on that particular container what is the 13th what he's going to tell so all this thing's so his past his present his future everything even though he will come to that is telling why the people may think only a one-block I hate that building and why he's not working for his going with the cabbage key chef chunder Shan sailed monasteries go team the people like Sri Ramakrishna Jesus Christ Sri Chaitanya issue belonged to a delicate species of humanity and they should be kept in glass cases very highly protected protected from the vulgar contact of the world the thing he was a that he could understand that they are totally typical people completely different and when we think seeing their just physical picture but they're just like us why they should not be like as it's not it they cannot when his Shahada a man of fair complexion and had a string of with Russia beads around his named master measure he draws the picture of words and he's such a nice way as if you can visualize the person whom the soundest is going to meet he was one of the renowned Sanskrit scholars of that time if breather of Orthodox Hinduism ceramic which name is going he is also Hindu but he is going to this bundle Martin Bashir's commenting or to Dobson reason is the villain what does it mean by or threaten reason some of the faiths are the belief that it should continue but the avatara's again and again particularly in Hinduism we find they come and they are all using only those things which shouldn't be continued because that is beneficial other things that changing like dresses previously the dress code was there should be like this food which must be like this behavior it must be like this language is really like this and this avatars are coming and telling it's not necessary at the time when snobbishness going to make this pundit it was speaking English was taboo the holy man Hindu should not speaking English because it's a foreign language and whereas surrounding himself sometimes he must not bring much of it but sometimes to break that law used to say thank you thank you see English words somebody said something he does it thank you before every month and sometimes he will encourage his young disciples who are studying in cattle universities and the colleges to speak to have the dialogue in English yes it said you understand it is you speak and he is asking them to speak in English and he is enjoying and he could understand that who is winning in the debate what does it mean this is not an answer is there not a language is not the thing religion means purity of the mind bliss it that those who are pure in heart but they shall see God Jesus is daily it's not the language it is not the food is not the dress so Slava Krishna he came he made the condi who was representing the traditional Indonesian the pundit saluted the master with reverence not in raqqa rom Achara Eve all they who had come with the Masters ramakrishna seated themselves in the room as near as the master so that whatever the master is telling sometimes used to salute lock eyes so they don't like to miss those words so these devotees who will great followers of Saddam additional they came and said as close as the master so whatever he said should be recorded should be noted should learn master again went into Samadhi after a while still remaining in the state he looked at the pandita said with smile very well very well he is gazing and thesis I have seen a Swami who could read the mind because and I think I told you about that not that other time is to disclose but in his vision time at least once we were all were there he narrated everything of a young boy who was claiming that he has made prudie's in the spiritual life when he went and dusting and that time he lost his eyesight's only when the boy touched him immediately he started telling everything about him and that young man he was trembling and no no no no like that he was going on getting we never would feel because apparently he was so devoted and so dedicated hourly morning he will get a signal meditation and a long period of time you'll be meditating we could never feel that these are the things of the air inside but this holy man they could feel immediately he said like that bearish shamanism I also did and think of the Amish Shami Vivekananda he was here and then he told about all these things particularly in France the modern Calvary she was a popular singer very famous in those days when the madam called becames none Shami me become the duty see her she was coming inside the room from a door and strong she was sitting exactly keeping the back towards that door the moment she stepped in Shami she started telling oh my god Tempest what you have brought with you and he went on telling think of it and after that young boy who touched the Swami and got all those we stop touching him we do not know what will come out is better to from distance and like this of course we are very young so this way it is possible as Ramakrishna the tremendous spiritual power he felt and said very well then addressing the core did the master say tell me how you give lectures he was very famous Sasuke indeed and giving lectures about in reason and he was thinking that in RISM is getting destroyed so he must try to help them at the Hindus said I tried to explain the teachings of the Hindu scriptures then the master sailed for the Kali Yuga the path of devotion described by Allah is the best for the Kali Yuga is the present age you know the total creation is now having the four times own and one is the Kali Yuga but the last now and the mind of the people who is very low there will be all the time thinking about the worldly things and even by cheating others and creating problem egoistic people all those things now we can see but even then the spirituality is rising why the God has come he has given the booster as slowly-slowly people's mind are opening up and whatever may be the very few but still there I'm standing in trying to so from that slowly it is moving ceramic richness a poor thing is not the Guayana model but is a mixture of guiana and bhakti and it says nor other is the best devotion described by nada but the knot of the state about the devotion and he said South which means for a much braver goofbot sod he never said he or she nor Allah is not he is describing the devotion and devotion must be Odegard but not least not giving any idea about the guard not the safe saw that - Ashwin Barama brave Aruba is completely nothing but the love pure Lila the form is pure love and what is pure love love without expecting anything how that is possible when you are completely unselfish you don't have anything at the back of your mind I will love I will show the concern or I will do this and that in exchange in return like one thing is now that it's not loud when it is completely different I love God because I love God love for love's sake and that he is telling Rama Rama Luba ash mean not the God but godliness the good qualities of the God and what is God show me we began the seed unselfishness is God the love is God that love and unselfishness as long as the devotee has high saints God is having a father but as in the Samadhi you and I it become one disculpa rama braver oprah currently as if this is a devotional book but no is a pure knowledge and knowledge means when you become one with God that is the Prima and there is no difference I and you that conception as long as is there it is not prema the love LOV that we see and sometimes we say translated as a different way but insensitive it says the Bremen mean this is oneness is not to not even the child the baby and the mother they have to know they're not one but when the god and the devotee become one there's not two and when there is no do what is that pure knowledge except a God there is nothing and that's why they arrived I am quoting one I a large Sufi is a one branch of the Islam the Sufi he realized the truth and then he said I am troubled who my God is also truth he had me at one siddur in Islam he and me and one whom Allah is a truth I am also truth and we both are the same now it reminds us the great coating of the Jesus I and my father in heaven are one my father is there I am here and the son of the Father in many places but once he is telling we are one how does win by one there is no conception of two then the father and the son that conception also vanishes what remains that remains and in Reda long back it says ah hum brahmasmi I that and the fiscal column of premium a loop of depth selfishness stealing through the how you can reach over there through devotion you can reach over there and the devotion when you are practicing you have the idea I am going to be one but one sees ambition in his own life he was worshipping the image of Kali and we know those who have read the biography of the Ramakrishna one point of time when used to worship he'll be worshipping himself instead of the image and he was putting out the garland which was meant for the particular image I mean Hinduism we cannot think of here it is written don't cross don't grow inside because sanctum sanctorium is ready so the heck we we are constantly thinking God is separate I am separate but when the separation largest one nowadays I am doing the puja you know what is this puja in the whole book it takes one hour to perform the puja daily worship but 15 minutes only think yourself that you are the god you have given a good watch the text of every time the pooja will be doing like this thereafter sitting you do like this we do and why is dream self of the Buddha whistle vairam sniper shot like that he used to you from here after do can imagine we don't allow the the shoe wall streeter over here but you're thinking just take the god your feet and you hate all being a nothing but God then they will take one flower and keep on the head and they will be thinking that I am worshipping God and what is that God my self is within the heart and worshiping with the nectar and India wishbone Hamish bond what are the flowers today one of our volunteers worked a lot of flowers and that did with decorating but actual flowers is the kindness mr. Lau is the purity is the sympathy is a service all these are flowers with that you are worshiping that is true worship and that's why sob - and here in the Sanskrit - means with determination it T's what is that that God prema Rupa and not only premium Barama in Sanskrit / Allah means the highest beyond that nothing is there what is the prima oneness one wit what dad which is consciousness dad who you call god father mother Jehovah buta whatever you may see such a tease what he saved but are not remember copies in the Randhawa this to feel that they are Krishna and for that the descriptions are there the gopis is too and they should to say why you are not worshiping me I am the original this is not the eagle but the complete realization the oneness of God one person came to Marshall a dominant a week to take the initiation he was the disciple afterwards because the sannyas are wrong Shani people face Vivekananda video channel afterwards he became the president of the Ramakrishna mission the realized soul but the young boy came to Marshall at the ready and he was telling Oh mother I have come now to you if I could come a few years before I could see sri lanka she so now krishna passed away in 1886 I could see starvation did the mother turn you have seen him no no no I am doing wrong is not the picture slump is named person but I was thinking mother is indicating about the picture photo of ceramic Krishna no no no I am NOT talking about that if I could come with you earlier if you is people I could see some distant person he was excited then the mother - you have seen in if you are seen in then she'll say lastly you are seen not only that you have seen him I am the ceramic is not one mother and honestly is not accredited one shamak Vivekananda's disciple and he's a very famous man he was a highly educated person and he was from East Wing of his to Gong and and one day he said I want to wash your feet another in devotion the devotees they usually like to wash the feet of the guru and worship we don't but we even do that and we're because the brahmanas don't like all this and in behind him no no sister he ever do and heal them brought one plate and good luck or bad luck he brought the plate from that sinner from tarkov from that Strine that particular vessel the blade was used for Taku puja now he brought that not me the importance of that ashram eg told by God that is used for takanuva prati anyway too quickly before Baba rom-coms Mohammed was in charge the manager and when almost finishing government entered the room and Shah Michi immediately said I I didn't do anything I was telling him that this place is usually used by Turkish puja and this fellow he was insisting what to do now see look at this fool here's what should mean and keeping my feet on that watching the field and what I will do you know whatever was the problem was say he has done the right thing u.s. not be worried can imagine varam of Bremen power this is the ceramic Asia and sharmaji are not different ma soeur domination are not different mark guardians Ramakrishna are not different but Anna Braemar robot we always think most of the people in give people they will come and say why there is no political Callie's right because Saddam pistol was used to worship Kali now and we have a Kali picture down in the basement big con I don't cook what the real kept that it is there but Southeast Asia forum on Bremen Rupa unwritten Barger he's also on Rita what happened if we become one with God it becomes a great great joy unbraided as if the nectar you have drunk and you were fooled with that no desire so in the third verse of the narrative of the shooter it says unwritten certain Parcher it is the form Aleister I did identical with the conception of that ambrosia 3500 young looked up one she told our team I'm window over T 3 T 2 over T after realizing dad then he means nothing now if we go to the pure knowledge what it says the Brahman away from my coma body and what happens how we will know that he is a Brahmin no desire at all and when you go through the path of devotion when you reach to God when he become one minicar water three two worthy completely satisfied to whom some business telling it telling a person with Anaheim Mike if you tried to read you are all intelligent people but you will understand that oh my god so difficult to understand gentlemen mahaprabhu was a great scholar of nine this nine Turkish Shastra and he was telling him why because unnecessarily just by debating this is these this is that don't which time don't waste time master Michele when he was giving their description of the person he said he's not cross that young age that means is am a diligent person and we do not know in those days the lifespan was very short so he was telling in that way your lectures are not helping only people very much so that is not very clear your lectures are not helping people very much and you will realize these by and by see Ramakrishna is asking again and again first to realize then you speak you cannot distinguish a lover of God from a worldly person it isn't your fault of course lover of God God and the worldly person and the boat how apparently now totally almost the same people know the lover calls a totally different time when the first numbers of the gale shakes the trees it is impossible to distinguish one from another the man who the calamari for instance the tamarind tree and the mango tree mango trees leaves a little bigger than the tamarind tree there is a very small small limbs but when the small strong wind is there all the trees are moving so fast you can understand which trees water similarly when that type of emotion God he goes on giving lecturing here there everywhere not understanding what actually he is to him so this is the thing we have seen the great personalities sorry conveyed an analogy in the brave scholar what about the speaking and all that when you give the microphone because he was the vice president visited that was the thing must have to do so you'll be going and sitting then he is assistant will come and say his secretary Maharaja now it is your time to speak then you can see the microphone and you taste that microphone and he will start without addressing usually we say frames devotees man said Salaam Edition are saying in the scripture it is this and if you say 25 music exactly 25 minutes in stop conclude and that was the control he knew what to say and when to say and how to say that much but you cannot say that he's a great speaker profound speaker but is realized soul Shami very sure on the ji maharaj he was a realized soul very high and talent settler mother but he was a very small short the structure and very simple time you is to work very fast most of the people used to accepting that his shabak the another Xiaomi very good-looking fair complex with good trace and all his to go behind they all come to him not many that this is the resident the president is very simple and and he said not me not me it is he go and touch his feet and monitored said no no no it's good you couldn't go to him even that's a--fun like that and all the assistance of the Xiaomi were very tough very good-looking very fair complex and he was very short people mostly used to make mistake but there's a clear scholar and at the same time realized soul and how to understand dad this is one young lady as she has written to me I have heard your nature is a very good but can you please tell me how to distinguish a good person and a bad person is very difficult who is a good monk and who is not all ones are looking all way of seeing how to understand who is good and who is not then I quoted from children tomorrow what to say I told that Jatin Parker who say whenever you approach a person cornea to him if you feel that your the feeling of God that is a spiritual person because he has realized the God when you go near him you feel like that when you are leaving him you feel like coming back once again that is a spiritual person that is the the children of ma Provost in my child Salaam addition is adding now addressing that great pundit when he was going he was villainous over what the fun date will be now he is addressing him as my child my child add a little more to your strength he's a scholar now the realization is necessary spiritual practice is necessary but bakery shabadoo journey Shastra back Conoco column in the week to remission crotch area stealing some people can utilize the words in such a way they can put the words in such a way that other people they get mesmerised completely the swami vivekananda could do that completely transponder but he's to control himself otherwise they will lose their own power personalities that that way and also many of the people nowadays in the modern society they know but not the Vivekananda I am mentioning about some people who are not practicing spirituality only utilizing some of the words and trying to tell people and little spiritual leaders my child add a little more to your strength practice spiritual discipline a few days more what is the spiritual practices in the bhagavad-gita it has so nicely this given bascially Yama is the practice spiritual practice that we do that not only that controlling the food not only that just in the physically very austerity we are practicing but also never ever telling any harsh words to any person and neva eva accepting anything negative all the time was whoever comes every time whatever the good things are there except that is all spiritual practices when what happens a mental transformation not that the physically will transform but your mental it will transform completely what will happen then majority of the time with direct experience and inference those who have realized directly they can understand that but otherwise we can infer by tilling or seeing studying people like this what do you find the common thing love and unselfishness no discrimination that this people belong to my caste maite a language my culture my country no border no differences first dollar six nothing everything same same Z so that is there my child had a little more to your strengths practice spiritual discipline a few more days you have hardly set your foot on the tree if
