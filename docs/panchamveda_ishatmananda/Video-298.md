[299. Panchama Veda 299 - “I Clearly See That God Is Everything”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWPBeTF5Dbg)

namaskar dear devotees and friends and this wednesday evening we'll be reading the gospel of sirama krishna the panchama veda as usual let us chant from this mantra now the last wednesday we have learned how to pray to god from bhagavan si rama krishna that was a unique way bhagavan sirama krishna was teaching but we have learned the only one who can pray who has reduced his ego a devotee must pray but one must be humble then only one can pray properly so we always talk about the prayer a prayer is a very strong we can say instrument in the spiritual life to reach to god to get his blessings to invoke his blessings but who can truly pray who has completely taken refuge when there is nothing else for him then only go and the burden we quote quoted from the bhagavad-gita how arjuna he was saying that letters oh oh god i take refuge in you i am your humble the disciple shisha's and from other scriptures also we quoted the how one should be very humble to pray now gita also the everyone was com we're praying to the supreme god that we are very humble please help us that prayer means the ramakrishna is we learn the teaching one must be very very humble and dedicated and completely depending on the grace of god then the prayer is answered that we learned last time and when one can become like that when one's ego has gone it is the ego only that always makes us creates this problem so this ego when the ego has completely eradicated ego has gone one has started feeling that he is nobody particularly the association with this body and mind that makes us feel that i am so that goes away and he feels that god is residing within and god is only guiding whatever i am doing whatever i am saying it is because of the god that is a wonderful way he can feel and that person's prayers are always answered now today we will read when bhagavan si ramakrishna is visiting girish chandra ghost's house but just before that tomorrow is the great thanksgiving so from those who are in america and all my american devotees and friends i wish you a very happy thanksgiving this is an unique way you know to remember those who have helped us the the word itself the celebration itself reminds us that we should always remember them be thankful to them and that is one of the characteristics of the human being remembering all the help that we receive from the people and then thanking them from the bottom of the heart that as because of you we are here today so usually we should thank the supreme god we should thank our ancestors we should thank the neighbors and the friends and each and every one so though the thanksgiving particular uh that was uh differently they they felt that ah their celebration began in america in a different way but we can accept it in a different way that we are thanking each and every one but anyway the happy thanksgiving so let us begin the when sirama krishna is visiting girish goes house as you know that i am reading from swami nikhilanandaji's translation the gospel of krishna the page 732 girish stood at the door to welcome the master the last time the last week we read the girish came to attend one of the programs the surama krishna was the meeting the devotees greece was also there then he requested the master can you please come to visit my house it was nearby but it was the evening nine nine o'clock at that time but still suramar krishna agreed because he used to like christian the ghost and girish devotion was uncomparable the giri stood at the door to welcome the master as sirama krishna entered the house girish fell at his feet and lay there on the floor like a rod so this shows the complete dedication girish verse as many of us we know he he was having tremendous ego and that person has completely transformed he has become so humble before everyone girish chandra ghosh lying down on his face and bowing down to srirama krishna can you imagine that shows the ego has gone and the blessings of god is on him the sudama krishna like the rama like the krishna he is also establishing the dharma but this time unlike sri rama unlike sri krishna he is not killing anyone punishing anyone so it is only the suramar krishna who is not having any weapon in his hand we see the bow and arrow in the hand of sri ramachandra we see that the disc in the krishna is because that is the vishnu and krishna also fought in different battles with different other people and particularly when he was young in through the wrestling also they killed the the people the bad people but srirama krishna the same in god's incarnation this time he is not having any weapon what is his weapon girish goes toward this time his weapon is humbleness eradicate the ego and you become god that is the unique way the god realization god realization we are going on reading books and many people they are going on writing the philosophy the millions of books are there on religion on mind and so many things are there and almost every day few thousand few million people will be discussing like me they're all about the religion and what is religion only to remove the ego and what remain is god and nothing else so sirama krishna this time in the modern age he has come the god himself has come and now he's establishing religion by teaching humbleness it's not that one should completely forget about oneself and think that i am nobody no nothing like that that is the highest spiritual condition but in general what we should think i can also do that is the self-confidence the swami vivekananda why i am telling this because sometimes we make the mistake by self-confidence and the ego we mix up the ego they say boastfully the i only can do and no one else and if they find that somebody else can do they will try to stop him if necessary to kill that is the ego but the self-confident person always say oh they can do i too can do so swami vivekananda is always encouraging us to become self-confident is his vedanta self-confident i can also do and as a support he says that truly you are that supreme being the god now we will go through the lines and we will see the how bhagavan suramar krishna is teaching us that thing sudama krishna entered girish gosh was lying down like that and at the masters beating he stood up touching the master's feet with his forehead sirama krishna was taken to the drawing room on the second floor the devotees followed him and sat down eager to get a view of the master and listen to every word that fell from his lips so this is very very important when you go to a holy person we should talk to him about the spirituality if you of course iram krishna never spoke anything [Music] except the spirituality but most of the time when the people they come to visit us they like to talk about other things so we also pick up that and we also talk like that but try to bring the spirituality try to bring the religion the morality but still sometimes just to have the conversation with them we also talk as they like us to talk but one should be careful when one is visiting the spiritual person should take the benefit of his companion the surama krishna that he went there and people were eagerly waiting what he will these people all this group they were all the time listening in the afternoon in somebody else's house very close to girishgo's house and then from there again they are following sirama krishna and this is also shows the social the culture in india if you are going to listen to a spiritual person you need not to bother about the invitation of that particular uh the householder now i like to go and listen to a holy man that visiting your house i will surely go and humbly say can i go inside and listen to him and they will be happy happy also please come maybe they are completely unknown the sometime in some of the places some advanced countries that you have to take the you know the information first you have to write to them they will agree then the time will be fixed then only you can go unless you are invited you are not supposed to come it is nothing like that again these are all goes for the ego and here i am humble i am free from that ego and i am going to listen to someone who is going to speak over there and i don't care i am not expecting anything else from you you need not to do any hospital at the hospitality over there i am just going to sit at the feet of the holy person to listen this is also shows a different type of culture so when we are reading here it gives the picture of that culture too a group of people who assemble in somebody's house that is in bhagbajar area and calcutta and balaram bush house and from there just a few you know blocks away they went to girish ghost and followed and they sat srama krishna was about to take the seat reserved for him he saw a newspaper lying near it siram krishna never liked the newspapers because the paper contained worldly matters mostly gossip and scandals so he used to avoid that then one devotee came his name is nitto gopal nittogopal came forward and bowed low before the master master well you haven't been to dakshinesha for a long time nitta gopal true sir i haven't been able to go there i haven't been well i have had pains all over my body master how are you now nithya gopal now not so well sir master bring your mind down one or two notes now sometime when we are practicing spirituality and our body and mind is not ready for that but we try forcefully to meditate constantly for five six hours naturally the effect comes on the body and the mind the best way at that time to lower down the mind a little maybe you just read some books or go to some friends where you can discuss about the spirituality and listen to the the divine songs and by that way you have to bring down your mind a little give the time again you practice so this is very very one should be very careful about it so that is the way that gurus they teach that sometimes some people will go on encouraging oh it is good if please go on meditating and concentrate your mind on the top of your head and that is dangerous or sometimes they will say it is you should concentrate your mind in between the two eyebrows that is dangerous they do not know they are not proper guru they are not understanding what type of harm they are going to do by that way so this is you are withdrawing the mind from the saints organs are withdrawing from the saints objects when you are detaching the saints organs from the saints objects you are going against the nature so obviously there will be a reaction that by nature our sense organs this eye the nose the ear the tongue they go out to enjoy the saints objects they are like that now the spirituality means you have to withdraw them and then slowly slowly tame them they should come down and then only you can concentrate this uh one young person came he is helping uh to recover from those who are become sometimes in the narcotics and sometimes they're very much into that so he is trying to help them that he was telling it is like taming a wild horse you're gonna simply go on the sit on the back of the heart you have to there are so many processes you have to give the time and slowly slowly slowly with a lot of patience you can tame that wild horse and think about our mind the wildest thing so obviously it likes to go and see you like to listen like to taste like to touch so many things constantly it is going on and you have to control them the master suramar krishna nithya gopal was trying hard to concentrate his mind he was a great soul and sudama krishna appreciated him but at the same time when he said my body is paining the sudama krishna told tone it down bring it one or two steps this this is very practical hinge for the spiritual life swami vivekananda he he also said that there are three levels physical level intellectual level and spiritual level if we try to be in the spiritual level all the time is so hard so difficult because you have to completely forgive everything forget everything detach everything of these worldly things it's very difficult it's not for all then you better bring down to the spirit from the spiritual level to the intellectual level then you go and talk with some people friendly people they'll be also discussing about spirituality read some holy books listen to the as i was suggesting the bhajans that the very good songs all the instrumental musics that come down your mind and yourself also try to compose some poems like that like that bring down your mind again you try to so this is a wonderful routine we should make in our spiritual life in the beginning itself they give us the routine you get up in the morning like this and then go to the shrine then afterwards chanting to the god some of the mantras then you finish your breakfast and go some do some work for the asama so that then again you sit with a book and read like that the 24 hours it will be a routine every day the same thing same thing and same thing the sometimes some young people they come to like to become a monastic then after a few months and few years they become restless they say oh the same thing we are doing every day that is the thing because you are taming your mind wild mind and the mind goes out even the before death also people's mind goes to the objects worldly objects is so difficult so taming the mind purifying the mind that means you have to withdraw the mind from and you are living in this world you cannot simply go in a secluded place and sit over there without food without anything and die over there not like that there is nothing like a a suicide it is living in the society mixing with the people going to for shopping everything is there but detaching so this is the training just with small one two cent words surama krishna hinting to that and he is telling to nithya gopal that you better bring down your mind bring your mind down one or two notes nityagabar i don't like people's company they say all kinds of things about me that sometimes frighten me but again i feel great strength within he is disclosing it to his guru and the master that's only natural who lives with you he is asking who lives with you tarak he mentioned tarak means afterwards in the book itself they have given the note tarak he is also a direct disciple of bhagavan sirama krishna and afterwards he became a sannyasi and very famous swami shivananda there are other shivanandas are also there in the yogi shivanandi is also there he's also very famous but this swami shivananda is of the belongs to the ramakrishna mission he was the direct disciple of sri ramakrishna and he became the president of the rama krishnamata also so this is shivananda his name was tarak his father was a great tantrika so he could worship the the keeping the fire on his hand like that his father and still that is that particular place is there where he used to worship so he had that occult power spiritual power and suramar krishna knew this tarak's father he has appreciated so this tarak he mentioned tarak he is always with me then he said but sometimes he too gets on my nerves so see when one is living together this is really really difficult in the monastic life where many other monks are there people are there you are living with them adjusting with them constantly that is the great sadhana but in the beginning of the the spiritual life when one is really trying very hard so he feel that no one should be around i should be alone but in the when he is trying to then he is advanced in that way we are telling beginning but he has already developed that capacity to leave alone it is not so easy when you are living alone without any company there maybe most of the time the chances are there they they develop a peculiar thoughts and sometimes they self-hypnotized you know that sometimes people they'll be hypnotizing themselves they're thinking oh i saw the light over there i heard that beautiful music whatever they read they start imagining that is another danger so one should be very very careful i will quote some of the scriptures today supporting the loneliness when you are practicing spirituality sincerely genuinely you should go to a lonely place all alone or maybe with one or two friends who are very of the same type of mind not that you will go and gossip and chat and cook and eat and do some sort of a picnic not like that very seriously you are going over there and making your own the time you are utilizing that there are some times maybe and the 24 hours one or two hours you are spending in that company they are just preparing some food or sitting together reading together that much the he is here we find shiva shemitah is a very famous book the lord shiva is himself telling i am telling you the truth i am telling you the truth is repeating and in sanskrit in this type of slokas when they repeat means it is 100 percent confirmed i am telling you the truth telling you the truth sattyam means i am telling you what he is telling sangha you have to shun the company shunning the company particularly those are constantly thinking about the worldly life world eating it's better to avoid them shunning the company very seriously you must avoid them this company of the worldly people they always talk like that and they'll be criticizing people as we all these type of things they have all their mind is all the time thinking about the worldly things and if you are in that company then it is really really difficult life general life and it's okay but when you are sincerely trying to develop the spiritual life this is very important manusamhita the the the law giver the manu he is also mentioning you should roam siddhartham for your success in spiritual life and also high why also high and depending on god only i am completely depending on god the god without you i don't have any want to help me so when you can completely depend on god and live completely alone then only it is possible to develop the spiritual life the realization the manu he is telling and kullarna tantra that is also in a tantra the [Music] when you are completely detached from the worldly objects worldly minded people the shanga means association when there is no association of these thing then only you are going to be successful and the problem is with the company of these worldly minded people dosa sangaja yes sangam is the company company of the worldly minded people will be constantly talking about the worldly things and in the world things means associated with the ego the name fame property how to acquire these how to acquire that that is the problem the one should be very very in the beginning we were reading bhagavan si ramakrishna even never wanted to forget about reading never touch that newspaper most of the news is will be we don't know how far it will be true or not and there are so many varieties of new so they always surama krishna is to avoid that why it will come on the mind it will influence your mind so one should be very careful so this is the but at the same time it says satam sango ibheshajam satam sanga that means the company of the holy people sat sat means holy the satam means holy the holy person's company it is it acts like a medicine the worldly objects are there and that always attracts our mind and we have to withdraw that and sometimes some people forcefully try to do that and by that way they create a tremendous problem in the body and mind and most of the time they lose their mental balances because so they should be very very careful we all of us should be careful and where we will go unless and until you are detaching yourself from the worldly objects there is no chance of success in this is in one side another side if you are trying it forcefully in the wrong process then you are going to lose your mind also there will be you will damage yourself your intellect and all that there will be great problem then what is the way out it says means the medicine what is that medicine company of a holy person and only we are reading you know that um the bhagavata in the bhagavad the great the devotee that he is asking to lord krishna you are also talking about the holy company but how to understand recognize a holy person nearly 30 uh the qualities the lord krishna is mentioning if you find all these third equalities then only you will know that he is a holy person not that all the 30 together in one person few of them even it is there that means he's a holy person so that is we may discuss it in our next class here it says the satam sangha but in one sentence we can say who is a satan who is a sadhu who is a holy person who has no selfish motive no selfish motive why because his own self is no more there that ego is no more there whatever he is thinking and trying to do and leaving everything for god and god is nothing but love so when he is loving god and he is feeling the other persons other people are also the same so let me go and tell them about that god about that love about the joy about that happiness so he goes on doing that type of thing so by that way he is leaving his life but he has the selfish agenda oh i will invite him feed him then in that against he will also support me i will get that benefit nothing like that the majority of the people in the politics in the business in the social life they always do like that it is necessary but in spiritual life who is a holy person who is full of love and unselfishness why because god is love and god is unselfish god has no motive to do anything just just by for love so this is the way we have to understand and when this the this gentleman he was talking nitto gopal the surama krishna was giving him this advice now he is talking about the the master nangta told me that there lived at his monastery an ascetic who had acquired occult powers he used to go about with his eyes fixed on the sky but when one of his companions left him he became this consolate so look at it sirama krishna is a great teacher he is not directly telling but indirectly giving the hint to the nithya gopal then why you are practicing austerity only to develop some occult power if it is so then you are going to lose everything most of the people they go for some something like that some occult power will be there something the magical thing will happen so religion means that type of that's why some people they consider a straight way that is a black magic nothing like that religion means love and that love without any boundary without any selfishness just to help people so that is we suramar krishna giving an hint to nithya nityogupal by telling about the nangta nangta means his own guru the nankted literally means the naked one he's referred to the tota puri ji tota puriji was a traditional vedantic monk and he used to wear just a loin cloth and nothing else in the body because the body's consciousness was not there that is the reason most of the traditional monk they were like that so he is ramakrishna used to call him in that name and he is referring to that he is telling the he mentioned the one person who was having in there the totality belongs to a great in a group of the monks so that association he referred that one must be careful though he said that i have some occult power but when he lost one of his supporters immediately he became mad and very angry and why it should be then what is the use of the occult power that means you have not achieved anything when you are angry that means you have some unsatisfied desire anger comes from unsatisfaction of the desire so whenever you are angry if you go and quietly see it and analyze the what are the things that i wanted to get and i didn't get so i became so angry so naturally when you are angry when you are mad that means you have no control over your senses you had some desire and that was not satisfied the occult power should not be the goal of our spiritual practice again the master went to and went into an ecstatic mood strange thoughts seemed to start his mind and he remained speechless after a while he said art thou come i too am here so master maha who was recording that he said who could pretend to understand these words why suramar krishna was telling like that who will pretend who will understand many of his devotees were in the room narendra girish ram haripada chuni balarama all these names he is mentioning and aim m is himself who is the the writer narendra did not believe that god could incarnate himself in a human body so that was a thought it was going on at the time most of the educated people they were losing faith in the traditional hinduism because so many other thoughts were also acrossing the society's mind and people used to think in that so many things were going on narendra was very intelligent he was 16 17 years young man and in that age he has read the western philosophers like spencer and others and also from indian philosophy so and he was loved to discuss and he was influenced by some of the in those days the thought god is all pervading and how can god take a human form that is some of the religion they think in that way but hinduism always believed that but young narendra at that time he was not believing and he said but girish differed with him he had the burning faith that from time to time the almighty lord through his inscrutable power assumes a human body and descends to earth to serve a divine purpose that is in the bhagavad-gita is very clearly it is mentioned but narendra was young boy we have to remember the narendra was a young boy and naturally whatever he read whatever he heard and then his own uh the presentation and he was thinking oh i have understood it correctly the god is all-pervading god is so big how can god take a small human form and human form means he is having so many other defects the god cannot have the defect so this type of arguments were there so girish chandra ghosh was elderly and he had this clear idea naren was not but they were debating master said to girish he has a very interesting the he he was very eager to listen that they should discuss it in the english so he said i should like to hear you and narendra argue in english in those days in that in particularly in india and in bengal of course because that was the british capital within british capital of india the calcutta so people those who were educated and they used to speak in english they loved to speak in english not in their new english very well girish also knew and sudama krishna himself were not knowing english but he wanted to listen how they converse in english and of course ramakrishna the god himself in human form he knew that someday this young boy the narendra will have to go somewhere outside this country and to speak in that english language so he knew that he didn't disclose but he was asking them to but the discussion began though but they talked in bengali the local language narendra said god is infinite how it is possible for us to comprehend him he dwells in every human being but it is not that case he manifest himself through one person only abu tara dabata manifestation as a human being so this is the doubt so narendra is the philosophical doubts so he was expressing that the god is residing in every soul every heart that is true but the god cannot assume a particular body human form or whatever and to manifest over there srirama krishna tenderly the he was discussing like that this tenderly means as because the young boy he is telling like that um he sudama krishna is not hard to say telling all the wrong thing it is like it is like that not not like that like a great teacher he's encouraging him at the same time trying to uh rectify tenderly he said i quite agree with narendra god is everywhere then sudama krishna is adding but then you must remember that there are different manifestations of the of his power in different beings it is not he himself see this is the philosophy and very carefully suramar krishna is mentioning this because he knew this philosophy and the choosing of the world and naturally it was so normal to him he never made any mistake anywhere so he is mentioning god has not manifested god's power manifested this is the great difference those who are following the our classes and those are students of vedanta you always know the god is consciousness but consciousness is having a power that is known as maya and this maya the god's power is completely doing all these things with which god has no association that is the philosophy the cerama krishna is mentioning but then you must remember that there are different manifestations of his power in different beings at some places there is a manifestation of his abijah shakti sirama krishna using the word avidya means knee science the wrong false knowledge so abhidjar shakti at others a manifestation of his biddy shakti now biddya and abidyah a good and bad biddah is good avidya is bad both belong to god's power no confusion at all then sometimes when we are talking about the manifestation at the creation the some of the philosophies philosophers they are confused philosophy means you have to give the answer as i always say of the three questions you have to answer who is the creator what is this creation what is the relation between the creator and the creation now there the god is the creator and it is his creation then when it comes to the last question what is the relation between the creator and the creation and many of the philosophers they are a different way they try to express why god means good how can he be bad then where from the bad came there are so many bad things like the greed like the delusion like the pride like the jealousy so many things are there bad things where from it came the god is the only being from it everything has come he has created this world then where from the bed came it was not there no but some people they think about another personality that is called devil and the devil has created these it is all devil's power then the philosophical question comes is there to entity the god and devil then if you say yes then god is not infinite god is not all-powerful how can he be infinite there is a space where he cannot go where the devil is ruling god cannot go there so it is not infinite you are not everywhere no there is some place you are not there so you are finite to that extent this is one second the moment there are conception of two there will be coalition that collide there will be war and somebody will die so where from then this conception the god is eternally living it has no part it is all pervading all powerful now you cannot say like that so these are the technical question philosophical question very subtle questions and srama krishna very easily he is solving by saying god's power manifesting yeah god power is manifesting and have you not noticed in some places he is bad power manifesting more so they are assurers the bad people and in some places his good power is manifesting so they are the incarnations of god like the buddha like the jesus like are the caitanya mahaprabhu shankaracharya so good people where from the god so sirama krishnas beautiful answer very simple but very clear you must remember that there are different manifestations of the power in different beings at some places there is a manifestation of his is abhidya and other a manifestation of his biddy abhiddha means greed delusion pride loba krodha moha etc and vidya means love clear understanding unselfishness and like that the god power manifest in different degrees greater and small therefore all men are not equal narendra said the god is residing in every being then why the power is not same all people should be same why not because the god's power it is not god it is god's power and god power is manifesting in different being in different ratio so some people are good or some people are bad about again we among the good there are very good people and some little good and something very bad a little bad like this then ram ram means ram data he was a doctor he was a great devotee of bhagavan sirama krishna he suddenly said what is the use of these futile arguments sidama krishna sharply no no there is a meaning in all these so this is hinduism hinduism always encourages questions debate so that your mind becomes your understanding become very clear so you must ask questions so there are prosnow upon each other means the questions the keynote they are constantly they are asking why how so the questions should be there and through the questions only you can and through the debate you can understand the thing properly in a better way if you hush it no no no whatever has been said you must follow then that person who is actually trying to understand his ideas in a career so he cannot grow properly in that spiritual life so that's why salama krishna immediately very sharply said girish to narendra how do you know that god does not assume a human body then narendra is mentioning he they are quoting from the scripture narendra is mentioning god is beyond words or thoughts in the upanishad it says that means the bach means the speech and the monument is thought in the beyond the speech and thought the god is so all-pervasive that you cannot give any definition you cannot express god through words and even in thought also the completely you cannot comprehend it is so vast so big the god is kali the goddess kali is not wearing the cloth why because nowadays we are putting on the cloth and mother but the why it is because hinduism is symbolic the goddess kali is all pervading and if it is all pervading the bigger than that a clot where from it will come how to cover them so that is the idea you say obama go charm the master the narendra say god is beyond words and thoughts surama krishna immediately rectifying him no that is not true the god cannot be measured or expressed through words or even thought sudama krishna immediately correcting he is mentioning he can be known by the pure buddhi that this is sirama krishna very clear he can be known by the pure buddhi which is the same as the pure self should the buddhi should in bengali he said should the means pure buddhi means intellect and what is this intellect as a vedantic student all of you know when that consciousness the pure consciousness reflect in that individual mind that particular part of where it is reflecting is called buddhi buddhi means intellect and from there the sense of i comes i understand i think i say i do where from this come from the reflection of the consciousness it is not real only reflection a room was dark and there was no light suddenly a sunray entered from the window and it reflected in a mirror the whole room became lighted is it that sun actually lighting the room no is a reflection of the sun on that mirror isn't it so this is way we have to understand our mind becomes conscious and the how we can say that we are conscious because we say i i me mind so that way we are conscious and what is this consciousness is a real no is a reflection of the original consciousness when that is completely pure pure means there is no connection with the worldly objects that particular mind can understand the pure self which is god the seers of the old directly perceive the pure self through their pure buddhi girish to narendra unless god himself teaches men through his human incarnation who else will teach them spiritual mysteries god takes a human body to teach men divine knowledge and divine love otherwise who we will teach girish is all the time is sticking to his point the abathara but narendra why god dwells in our heart he will certainly teach us from within the heart like a another young boy is mentioning that the god is within our heart so from the heart only he will mention like that he is mentioning the sedan krishna again because he has a great love for narendra and he knew that narendra right this moment is not understanding he will understand it he will be a great vedantin so he will be a great world teacher afterwards right this moment he's trying to understand it's okay tenderly yes yes he will teach us as our inner guide as our inner guide when we are trying to we first go to a holy person we accept him as guru then according to his words according to his teaching we try to develop our spiritual life and we go on asking questions we consult the spiritual books and by that way slowly slowly slowly when the more and more the more we develop then one day it comes it becomes like this that person who wanted the guidance of the guru or the book or the scripture he himself can understand because from the inner self he feels the mind itself becomes his guru again the surama krishna's original bengali word he said your mind will become your guru you need not to go to outside again all the time consulting with this man that person no it is not necessary you yourself will understand this is the thing that i should do those are the things i should not do this should be followed like that the mind should be given so when the narendra didn't mention like this but sirama krishna rectifying and supporting him gradually noreen and girish became involved in a heated discussion if god is infinity how can he have parts what did hamilton say what were the views of the harvard spencer of the haxley and so forth and so on so all these philosophers they were quoting the master to aim to the recorder he said i don't enjoy these discussions so we have the habits some of the people the so-called intellectuals they always try to quote some other intellectuals but have they realized god that they are talking about god these also friends we have to understand we quote from this man we quote from that man he gave this lecture he gave that lecture nothing wrong if you are interested read that for the spiritual growth one thing is necessary that the person who is talking giving you the instruction have they realized truly god or otherwise a very good uh the writer here's the command over the language and he is writing in such a beautiful way the people read and think oh this is a great writing it may be great but those teachings those words will never help you to develop spiritual life the speakers also sometimes they will mesmerize the thousands of people because of their capacity and to speak that some people they have that type of power but not that they are spiritual teachers spiritual teachers are those who have already realized god so sudama krishna when they were quoting from different people he understood that they are only trying to show their knowledge he didn't like it so he is telling i don't enjoy these the discussions why should i argue at all now here salam we will conclude by reading this line i clearly see that god is everything he is concluding we will conclude is is going on so i clearly see that god is everything that means realization the afterwards this young narendra who is now arguing he said religion is realization thank you friends we will continue from here in our next class let us see if there is any question so the first one is a comment from she's saying life is very hard your education helps a lot to face it gives us peace and strength we are grateful for your guidance thank you pranati and pray to mother that mother's blessings be always with you the next question is from mohit he's saying can you help us to understand a little more about the role of maya that is tricking us every day in this world and how to catch it or see it or practice so that we can understand it better so it is mahiti were very correct the role of maya is so confusing all the time and we are in that but obviously it is difficult to understand but they say the maya has no beginning i repeat maya has no beginning because it is the power of god we are associated with god whenever the god was created maya was there when god was created nobody knows it is eternal but maya has an end god has no end but god's power this maya has an end why because it is going to cover the truth and superimpose something else on that truth you know that so obviously if you can understand oh this is the truth the cover is not true immediately that vanishes as an example as we always say that if you see in the mirage and the desert we see the water we see even the ripples on the water but so many that those who see that then you go near and you see no it is nothing only dry sand so what happened the maya vanishes mirage vanishes who created that our ignorance who removed it our knowledge so this is the only way we can go beyond maya through the knowledge and what is that knowledge everything around that we see are very very temporary right from the sun down to this earth everything is temporary then why should we dedicate our life our energy our education our mind so for this temporary thing we should go for something which is permanent and that is god the moment you take that oath and try the maya will immediately remove open the path thank you the next question from dev journey she is asking is the manifestation of the power of god dependent on the karma of that being only so as good or evil that is correct your question that the manifestation of the power of god depends on the karma of that person if it's a good karma the manifestation of the biddamaya the good shakthi the good power holy power will manifest through that person but if it is a bad karma so obviously all the bad things that is there in abhidhya shakti of the my god that will manifest through that it depends on karmapala is correct shrimah is asking how do we how we escape ourselves that devil like person if they are very close to us and that is you know the in practical questions that sometimes some very bad people they are so close to us maybe among our friends among our relatives so it is difficult but you know sima what i can feel if you go on praying to the god god please either you take away that person from me or change his mind towards me if you pray sincerely that can happen then that we can solve that problem so thank you very much thank you friends so let us uh chant this mantra and we conclude niranjanam [Music] is [Music] [Music] namaste
