[121. Panchama Veda 121 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAW-QhwERW8)

let us begin with this mantra tabaka Tom rhythm topped achieve annum co vive read item calma shop ahom cigana mangalam srimad athim boo begun on da buried aryana now we were studying the conversation bhagavan sri ramakrishna ceramic ISNA the master ma cherie ma mind the nard gupta he is noting he said ceramic rishni was praying to the Divine Mother but the prayer was very special he said Oh mother is addressing the divine mother Kali o mother then he said Oh embodiment of all now here mother is the embodiment of Shakti Tantra ohm is the symbol of Vedanta but ceramic ISNA addressing the same Godhead goddess Kali as both he said o mother o embodiment of home so here comes mother how many things people say about d but I don't understand any of them I don't know anything mother I have taken refuge at thy feet I have short protection in d Oh mother I pray only that I may have pure love for d-die lotus feet lab that seeks no return and mother do not delude me with I world be switching Maya I seek thy protection I have taken refuge in d now this is Maya me Tom Duran TT Sri Krishna whom we usually consider is the god of the bush nervous now in Hinduism there are three major paths leading to the God one is the pedant a second Tantra third Bush nabha now ohm we will discuss about it is the symbol of the veranda and mother Kali Tantra and also in the boy she never sweet Krishna who in the bhagavad-gita very clearly said whoever takes refuge in me he only are they only can go beyond my Maya my delusive power so did this delusive power that is called the maya here serrano krishna taking the refuge at the kali and asking her to protect him from that Maya so this is the same thing in three different terminologies three different names and whatever people they think when the Krishna they think o Krishna will be the good so I will go for the Krishna and maybe some people they Co the Tantra and Sam for the Vedanta but all are leading to the same goal in Vedanta what is the problem problem is the Maya what is that Maya I I I this ego this ego which is making us totally different from the original source in Tantra same in Vedanta same here we find the Honorable mm gopinath garage he was a great exponent of shock the villa Xavi shakta is on Sheba and Goddess Kali this is the concept of the chakras Sheba and Kali here the gopinath garage he mentions Shiva and Shakti are conceived as constituting two aspects of one and the same divine principle Sheba though the male body Shakti goddess Kali order ooga as a female the mother figure but they are one and the same divine principle Sheba is the age agent transcendent and shakti the kali is the instrument imminent so that is the usually anyone we can understand from our own experience that we have a certain thing and the gross subtle is the thought which no one can see and only people can understand and see when it is translated into action when it is transformed into action might thought then transform into action I saw a place and I thought I should construct it over here that is nobody knows then I started working on that one day I invited my friends to inaugurate that house then people say oh it is your house this is also good now when the thought came no one could know that is Shiva that is certain that it but that is the main power without that consciousness without that tort actions not possible so Chiba is the agent but the transcendent shifty is the instrument is transforming we see the construction is going on over here hundreds of people working so many different type of machines are working but when we see them they are working RT really the master now somebody else sitting somewhere and then we find them of the officers coming with the papers they are designs and almost all those things are there are they the master no somebody else then ultimately when we reach to him similarly when we see the goddess Kali she is creating preserving destroying we go to her then she directs her toshiba the consciousness and the Dean week understand the same Sheba is manifesting working through mother the divine power and that is the ultimate group goal of the Tantra unity of this too is the ultimate goal of the Tantra the cosmic manifestation of Shakti is however in essence the manifestation of Sheba himself conceived as imminent so is Kali different know how the expression that the Vedanta always gave as you cannot separate the burning power of the file from fire similarly you cannot different you cannot make it out the Shakti from the shakhter that means the one who is having the Shakti that is Sheba the consciousness now show me Mook ananda in his writing explain oh the most hensive universal non-personal holy sound symbol or logos and bar checker designation of the Supreme infinite divine reality called Brahman mochi analogy was our teacher in turning center very vast knowledge and he has written different books and this is a small book but he explained so nicely about the own card for everything the Hindus will say ohm the show me who came this time to perform the Durga Puja he has set up his answering machine telephone begins with ohm ohm you have reached to my yogananda services like that the Hindus always feel that the moment you say own you are purifying anything to make purified as a own home what is this Oh only to later or oh ma that is the in Sanskrit they write o and M oh and in sometimes they write a you m own pronunciation pronounced in that way what is this own the most comprehensive and it's called sound symbol logos in the Greek philosophy logos and in Sanskrit Hindu bow chicka bow chicka means designation of the Supreme infinite divine reality Brahman now when the president of America has come somewhere the people are addressing him honorable president what is it who is the president then he has a name he has some a family he has some identity all things that here but the moment they say the honorable president that is called bar checker the symbol the sound we understand though everything about that person the similarly the moment you pronounce ohm you understand Brahman the ohm is not a sim just the sound it indicates identify with the Brahman it manifest as the total totality of existence totality of existence again the hindu ways for cosmic planes for cosmic planes from micro cosmic that means individual to macrocosmic universal there are four planes are there they have designed in that way micro the individual macro the universal the total of four what are this for first is physical gross level everyone we know we understand you can see we can't argue can smell we can feel we can test within this five categories comes the gross level then comes subtle level that is called psychical this psychical monica we think so many things in the mind and then we imagine we create sometimes when we can create something very good we are happy in the dream sometimes we create a very wonderful dream and we are happy if someone comes and breaks that our sleep you're angling away was dreaming so in I was enjoying why did you disturb me but the thing is it was all psychic oh in that plane and third is called also at the potential cause a potential all the potential energies are there only we have to manifest so that is called potential that potential is the cause of see house in a very subtle way they have explained the whole thing and the totality right from individual to the universal that Universal it comprehends everything everything individual a part of it so it is expressed in the world the word microcosm and macrocosm show me be wakin on the ones those who have read the biography of Vivekananda you know that in regard the place called  regard that is in in Himalaya in almora near the al-moraad is very famous town city so he SAT her meditation and then he revealed within himself realized microcosm and macrocosm are nothing but the same thing that which is huge it coming in a small tiny form there's a macro microcosm so this microcosm and macrocosm total is four and that is called the total now here it says the physical and psychical the potential these three labels the boo-boo bovis wha that's sweet uber innum burger da vishuddhi me this is the brahmanas after taking the gayatri mantra the famous by d comin through they chant this what is this blue these three planes gross physical and psychical and cosier this total three is called boo then booba is transcendent again is called meta phenomena now whatever we see beyond that is a meta phenomenal that is called the poobah we can call in between then they're aboard a Brahma the Creator is the swab boo boo boo swap these are the three labels boo boo boo SWA called 33 33 boo bona or in total brahmanda that means it's a brahmanda most of the Vedanta again and again he will come from and what is that Brahma Honda you slay under is the egg a Brahmin it is the as Eve like a egg in complete total everything inside that is called brahmanda actually this brahmanda means these three different planes and these three different planes Booga Ooga and swap beyond these three lockers is toria that is the goal there you have to go that is the goal for each and every human life the moment we are within these three some people are only physical level they do not understand anything except the physical level when they drink when they eat when they do something they are happy and they say oh I have lead my life wrong there's only physical level you have lived then they start reading books to start enjoying the poems they start understanding the songs they start thinking why this is happening why that is not happening they start thinking in that process and slowly slowly their mind is rise and that is second stage then comes causal and that is may more subtle and even then there only three circle that is not even nothing you have to go beyond that then comes transcendental the there was a one time the wave came in erica TM this TM waves a transcendental meditation and those who introduced they become very rich because to to enjoy the transcendental meditation you have to pay so you have to come to the again the from the fast level physical level first p then enter then you sit quietly or something and afterwards you know the problem with the crowd when you are sitting with maney you cannot express your own individual idea suppose everybody after closing their eyes and slowly did becoming dirt and this sweet music is going on smell is there and after one hour they slowly come how you felt then some 120 I was it is divine and you are sitting by his side when they ask how you felt you can really no I didn't see anything oh you are a sinner go away you cannot say like that so you have to pretend oh yes yes yes maybe that you just dozed off you just slept but still you feel something I'll come out and say yes so people did not express exactly what they ferried so naturally in the name of all this transcendent but once we go beyond this physical then psychical then causal level can you imagine the joy that's called transcendental level wonderful that situation that condition once we go in that it is impossible now beyond this locus called toria each and every one of us almost every day we go to that too dear but we do not understand when you sleep mostly our mind is active body is inactive but the mind is going on in action and dear we see the dream and a time comes in the fall period of the sleep when there is no dream all sir that is the most peaceful time of sleep and when we are in the dream we are in anxiety or enjoy but the mind is tired though in the mind is trying either mind is working than not the body but that the tiredness is felt in the body too suppose a tiger is chasing you you saw in the dream and when the that dream is broken you feel the Perth all that pulse rate has gone out and you are sweating physically you did nothing only it was mental but the symbol comes on the physical level to the physical and the psychical they are so close to each other and then comes the causal what are the causes again that is also there because you saw something maybe a movie or something it is mixed up and that all things came but suppose you go beyond that when you don't see any dream that is called the Toria condition when you are sleeping without any dream that he come back and we say oh I had a wonderful sleep I'm feeling fresh how could you say that when your body was inactive mind was inactive how could you feel when the body and mind was absent that you slept so that is the question the moment we can get that answer who could realize it understand it coming back and reporting that I slept well and that is called Earthman and here the own Cara represent all this idea now raghavan see Ramakrishna when he is praying to the mother Kali and he is praying o mother o embodiment up oh all his to do two words he used when you read it has no meaning but if you understand this is the wonderful depth in these two words o mother o embodiment up oh then the discussion is going on and it says like that M had been visiting the master for the past two years and had received his grace and blessings the aim was initiated by Sri Ramakrishna so he is mentioning it means the master marche the brighter whatever conversation used to listen we came out with other people and he had a wonderful memory photogenic memory is to come immediately and note it down in his diet everything then sometimes see Ramakrishna's to ask him what did he say on that day so to see that he is correctly representing him is visiting for last two years he had been told that God was both with form and without form that he assumed forms for the sake of his devotees to the worshiper of the formless God the master said hold to your conviction but remember that all is possible with god all is possible with God if you remember it everyone all the religious people they are selling God is all-powerful omnipotent all-powerful when you say all then can't God manifest inside an image why not if it is it totally powerful you can do anything the two monks were meditating when they saw nada is going to make the bishnu the bhagavad you said Narada you are going to be snow local is it yes will you please tell me what the god is doing when you return sure then he went over there and at the time of returning he said yes I saw he is putting a camel from the small legal I the one said Oh God is all-powerful everything is possible for him other one said no it is not such a big animal how can you put inside the small all it's not possible if you say God is all-powerful everything is possible otherwise you have to say God is not all-powerful he has some limitations these are the things God cannot do only I can do so if that way it is not but the moment we say that God cannot be with the other religions that we see are more powerful than the god so this C Ramakrishna again and again in this modern age that is the only problem there is the only problem without religion we cannot survive humanity and religion our relation is just like the water and the fish fish cannot survive without water between the same water become contaminated that same thing becomes the cause of the death of the fish similarly without religion we cannot survive but that religion wind becomes aggregated totally isolated that philosophy that religion makes the human being suffering we are understanding every day because the clear idea is not coming only my god and my path my religion we're from you came we're from why the idea came and if you say all-powerful that's why I Ramakrishna almost every pages we find again and again he is telling in this way hold to your conviction this is the specialty of the teaching hold to your conviction I love God is formless or I love God with form and this is the form maybe sometime Krishna maybe sometime Christ maybe sometime but there may be something Ganesha whatever form i like i like this is my liking I like the God and that God should be like this and but remember that all is possible with God he has form and again he is formless he can be many things more then master to in the master means the Ramakrishna to the aim you have accepted an ideal that of God without form isn't that so previously he asked him he remembered she is asking him in those days because of the the people this to speak about in this way how can God be inside an image it's not possible God is so big how can he enter into an image it's not possible so they were confused a group of people they were thinking in that fashion mostly the modern educated people aim was also educated so he was also in that group he expressed his mind ceramic ISNA remember and said you have accepted an ideal that of God without form isn't that so so he reply he said but I also believe what you say that all is possible with God it is quite possible for God to have forms and ceramic is not good remember further that now he has gained the second stage remember for the that as consciousness he pervades the entire universe of the living and non-living this is called Vedanta the ceramic ISNA apparently is so simple he never took any education from any institution but his idea was so clear idea about the about the religion about the philosophy or the spirituality the wind God is with form is without form now he's telling all pervading as consciousness the moment you were thinking God is formless but you close your eyes what you see when the people they go and they believe that God is formed as God has no form they go to a particular place of prayer and then they all the seat they close their eyes to see God where what can human being conceived anything that he or she has not seen before any idea impossible then we think God is like the ocean big vast and or maybe like the sky maybe like the Sun but each and everything is a figure as a fall either the ocean or the sky or the Sun or the huge mountain everything is the fall all these are forms so obviously we cannot conceive but the god formless all the reading how consciousness when you look at the consciousness my body is totally different and an animal and or an animal but it has a life that's called consciousness I too am having so that way we are all saying sometimes i give the example the different type of lights are burning some are your laws are wide summer d green and now the winter is approaching most of the people they will decorate their houses with wonderful colorful bulbs but only bulbs are colorful but the electric current is the same it is passes through everything and the same as sometimes some of the tiny bulbs they need very little electricity but the big one they need more electricity is manifest more similarly a holy man he is manifesting in a more way but the same thing and that is the reason when you look at this is that we are all same swami vivekananda say each soul is potentially divine each soul is potentially devant it's not manifested potentially and this potential divinity means all the good qualities that the manifestation manifested state is having it is there an important in a hidden way we have to express so he said Buddhahood is our right anyone can consider himself as blood with the one day today I am in this condition but some day will come i will just like the Buddha because the knowledge he manifested the knowledge now a person is going to understand the medicine in the medicine thats cool that they are going the famous doctors are coming giving them classes and they are noting writing understanding and going along with him asking question sir is this this is this that but he dreams a one day you become like him the same way after some time after few years when he learned that experience that then the knowledge manifested in him then he will found that the same way as he used to follow his teacher now many people are following him to understand the same knowledge and that is the reason relevancy Ramakrishna said to kishore chandra shane the famous leader of the Brahmas he said Keisha please repeat after me like a mantra bhagavath puchta Raghavan paga wat is the book like the Bible Quran trip attack bhagavad-gita is the book but that is not God there's only giving the idea about God some people are so narrow minded some people the printed it may be one page at a time of printing has gone out now then they will go on killing others so that is the wrong way that is nothing that is bhagavata means only the book then comes the bhakta bhakta means the student who is reading that book trying to understand that book trying to follow the teachings of that so that is called doctor and the incomes the Bhagavad on the goal the knowledge if we go to a college then we fail we don't understand the particular knowledge we cannot claim that I'm a doctor or an engineer or this of that we cannot so similarly when a person is following spirituality religion unless and until he has realized those truths in his own life leaving on that truth we cannot claim that he's a religious man he should not we cannot when you were leaving and that singing thought plane of the others and jailers criticizing others angry with others always trying to grab others and all the craving for the human appreciation the any ordinary people are having those things those qualities how can you claim that you're a religious man the religious person has already fixed his mind on god and what is that God all consciousness everywhere in that case how can you say like this that is the what's the ramakrishna is teaching stick to data ideal now there is no need of cheering down and changing one's attitude now something we are having in the mind if we try forcefully to change it wrong but stick to that and keep it open mind slowly slowly he will understand the all other things are also the same show me be waken they again on this point he gave a wonderful in a nice sentence it is better to born in a church and not to die there so we have to understand charge means the ideology is a born in a church not that the birth was the adenine cited church is not but physically it's a bitter to bogna church in an ideal whatever ideal it may be and not to die there that means you have to go beyond that oh this is the only thing then he said the wonderful stories and in the Chicago if you read that Chicago addresses one of the in the lecture here is mentioned about frog in the well the frog that was born and he was leaving in the well it never in didn't see in his life to any other water body and he was satisfied very proud of his place then one day another frog came and fell over there then this too was having the conversation where from you are coming he said from the ocean Oh ocean is this so big like mind as well he said what you were talking about ocean is so big so vast you cannot imagine well well I will show you how big this one we jump from one corner to another is it so big yer ocean they naturally the second one became angry and say you were a fool you cannot imagine even come with me I will show you the ocean then this fast one say no you are a liar because my grandfather said DC is the place and he leaved over here and my father also said more and i am also leaving here I never saw anything else you must be a liar I should drive you out from here this Bakari there's narrowness so when the mind become close don't like to listen don't like to hear the human life become just like a machine then 18 do they can do anything but they can't think like the machine you cannot think originally so this way ceramic ISNA is again and again telling stick to the ideal there is no need to tear it down you will gradually come to realize that the consciousness is in conscious beings is the consciousness of God consciousness in conscious being is the consciousness of God he alone his consciousness otherwise there is nothing and that is why didn't the breed our own ago benicia every old upanishad it goes on and that the speciality in the Britannica if one he wants to say anything he'll go on repeating giving different names and the young kabalka is the main Rishi main teacher and he was telling to the God game and the lady she asks the question and then he said that wife is loving the husband not for the body but for the consciousness husband loving the wife not for the body but for the consciousness and then these these these these going on telling we understand that when this body something happened we fall and the doctor comes and declared dead all other people very close we are associated with that body this to feel proud with that now this okay okay okay put him in somewhere else why if the body was so important why you are not putting that under the art or burning as the Hindus they do what is not important then the mind the thought no then what is important consciousness that consciousness is very very important here let me ask you one thing now he is tasting the disciple how he is growing in spirituality do you feel attracted to money and treasure now that is the yet stick for the spiritual people now he is trying to understand his own disciple do you feel attracted to money and treasures then he said no sir but I think of earning money in order to be free from anxiety to be able to think of God without OD C Ramakrishna oh that is perfectly natural C so practical but when you constantly think about the money money money then what happened we forget the whole world we forget the above the world the god also so they have been only thing that happens is the ego and to satisfy the ego these are the problem happens then he is asking the disciple is asking is it greed master you were right he is not giving the answer to this question he is thinking of the statement that he gave I am earning money to maintain the family and when I know that I have little money then at least I I can without any or II think of God in the mahabharata-- that we were studying over there in the hindu temple and the last Saturday there are for the goals of human life Dharma artha kama and moksha Arthur means the money in the Mahabharata it says you must earn money if you're a monk okay but if you are not in the if you're in the society you must have to support yourself and then it says whom we can call as rich person who is having the stock or his money to maintain his family for three years with sub-region maintain his family for three years suppose whatever you have earned that is your in the bank or in in some deposit which will can be utilized to maintain the family for three years without any addition then you were a rich man rich person so here salam o Krishna said if you are earning money to maintain your family that is good you are right otherwise who will look after your children what will become of them if you feel that you are not the door now everywhere this speak about the charity donation if the excess give now sometimes some people emotionally work there was a very famous person chittaranjan Darsh was a very famous add pocket and he earned a lot of money he was also a national leader when the national movement started freedom movement so for to fight against the so you needed some money chittenden jaw started giving them some money and he became very famous people gave him a title deshbandhu he is the friend of the country and he he give everything without thinking that after him what is going to happen to his wife and after when he died his wife had to bake from others in the society thinking of the respect of the person they made him made her some livelihood and somehow that should not be when this bog avanza Ramakrishna who could not touch the money even then he said you asked the mother Masara the manadavvi when I am NOT here when I possibly how much money you need to maintain your life family because he knew this mother is not alone the devotees will come other people will come they will take food and all these expenses are there how much you need mother was feeling shy to tell if I I die then how much money the mother told on you need not to think about that now but the Serrano Krishna because he married so as a responsibility of the husband to the wife that is this now recently I read in news in the Indian newspaper and there's very bad information one young that wife she wanted to go out with her husband to see the durga puja in navami d because it was raining all over so it was difficult for to go out naomi was the last day we know just t-to navami this navami was the last day if we cannot go out we won't be able to enjoy the Durga Puja she was going on ringing the husband he never picked up the phone and then afterwards he came back at about one-thirty date night fully drunk and then the when the wife complained white even today you could not take me out it ok you want to go and see go without your body then you can see everything and he killed her the small thing she just wanted to go out but the husband he never knew the responsibility to look after the wife once you are married you must have to take this responsibility now of course he'll be in the jail and you'll be there and all this but think about the poor lady what she wanted only that much even as a husband he could not can you consider him as a human being forget about his religion so that is the thing sharp brain understanding state-by-state what I as a monk I have different table responsibilities I don't have family but I have other different responses because i am we dean an organization and again another monk who is not having any organization who is free he has this different type of things to do as a monk he cannot do anything which is wrong in a society among should not do why because the others will learn from him so these are the all responsibilities that ceramic ISNA he is now he's giving that teaching to the householders you are right otherwise who will look after your children what will become of them if you feel that you are not the doer then again he said keep your present attitude it will be different when the consciousness of duty drops away of itself the consciousness of duty that will go we then he is asking to his disciple the aim tell me what does one attained through money joy Gopal Shane he was a very rich person he is giving the example Jaggu Paulson is such a wealthy man but he complains that his children don't obey Him now the family man as a father if the children are not listening to the father do he is having the money all is the feeling of bangs the old my children are not with me that constantly the pain he's feeling and again the master masha said is poverty the only painful thing in the world there are six passions besides then disease and grieve then see Ramakrishna said and also name and fame he is adding the so many different ways the misery comes the name and fame the desire to win people's recognition well what do you think of my attitude now he is asking his disciple what to think about me because when I am talking with this do you think just intellectually I am giving you this argument who is trying to understand his own decided first he asks the question are you attracted to the money or wealth then second he is asking what to think about me not that he say Ramakrishna was proud but he wanted to understand the understanding about him from his own disciples and he said in this what do you think about me this name and fame for some people majority of the people other things up there but those who goes up and the higher ladder of the society start getting some the popular people if they become in different field that is the problem suppose an actor in one or two different situation he's successful and next 2-3 is not successful immediately he is out of that and in every cases this is the thing this very very difficult and very very painful it happens like this and also the name and fame they desire to win people's recognition people do so many thing for that with people's recognition then he's asking about himself and three more answering you are always united with God he is very perfect he never saw see ramakrishna's an ordinary person very difficult he is behaving just like a very ordinary person but still as a disciple to think of his guru with whom his two years is very intimately a mixing and going and leaving and all that now he has developed that pure idea you are always United with God that means you are not different from God master do you ever dream of me the ceramic is not asking even is very personal then the master master said yes said many times then he said how did you dream me as giving you instruction him remain silent because there's so you never wanted to speak it before others then ceramic is understood and he said if you ever see me instructing you they know that it is a chit Ananda himself that does so such cheat on under s80 set then cheat and Ananda that is the the way of expression about the Brahmin own is the expression of Brahman sachidananda the expression of that same Brahman he never said God he said sachidananda is the consciousness and he said not these body but the consciousness when sharma vivek under came in this country in America and he lectured all over he didn't mention the name of ceramic esna his guru only one lecture he gave much afterwards when the people came close to him and they were asking who is your master then he my master he gave a talk on that that is in a book form it is available but he spoke only the ideologies ideals of ceramic esna when you went back even his brother disciples they were asking him many people they asked him he didn't talk about the Ramakrishna our guru our master then he said do you think that body is only ceramic ich nur say Ramakrishna is the ideal and this ideal is going to spread out everywhere and when we see the modern world we feel that's correct the parliament of religions everybody is talking about that different table laterz are coming to us we are organizing this the meat of different religious leaders will you please come we're from it came can you imagine just off before hundred years of 50 years it is impossible America is the first country the only country that thought of calling inviting different religious leaders in this Chicago that Chicago is so important very very important and if you go to India and ask anyone about a foreign country name a foreign country any village student you'll see America they know it if you ask him any other country they may they may not but America everyone nose then you ask them do you can you name any city of America Chicago why because Vivekananda because Parliament of religion because the thought of all those even the remotest part of the country in India in the village if you go and ask this two questions you will get this answer why Chicago because Chicago is the place where they could organize parliament of religions and this is necessary and that is the ideal of ceramic ich nur in the beginning with remember that everything is possible with God you have a an idea stick to that but remember that God is it is everything possible with God then he was telling you must know that is sachidananda himself that is the God Himself relate is his dream experience to see Ramakrishna privately who listened to them attentively then he commented that is good we do not know how he related that is good don't reason anymore you are a follower of Shakti though master Masha used to read lot of pedantic book but the ceramic ich nur said you are the follower of Shetty tantra so one has the attitude we have to understand what they were edited I am having so better to follow that when you are not having that attitude still try to follow it will be devastating you won't be able to reach so it is better to follow your own path so friends so you'll stop over here and we'll continue in our next talk the wonderful way salam o Krishna is explaining now please recite after me offering our respective ceramic ich nur needin genom nityam anantara pom-pom tano compa Drita
