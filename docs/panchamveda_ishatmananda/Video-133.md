[134: Panchama Veda 134- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEj9OCySYN4)

today we will discuss about the wonderful teachings of the master and it is begin with this mantra toka Comrie come topped achieve annum go be very little calm of Shaba home subhana Mangalam 3 magatha tongue movie grinning PA poori dodging aha last time we heard in our last class a very important sentence Ram Krishna said about the spiritual life he said one can certainly see God through the practice of spiritual discipline one can certainly see God through the practice of spiritual discipline this is very very important he didn't mention who can see God anyone can anywhere so that is very important sometimes people always discriminate now you cannot see God because we were born in a low family you are not educated you are not reach you or these your dad so many but Salaam o Krishna is very clear and he says anyone can see God one can see God certainly that also you mentioned and he says through the practice of spiritual discipline this is important again just because the human Barton do you have to practice the spiritual discipline what of the spiritual discipline we know in Sanskrit we always call it sodden our sadhana is the spiritual discipline and again the sadhana in English we translate austerity so these austerity and the spiritual practice and the sadhana what is this what are the things that we should do that is important mother said Marshall the money Devi she said my son sadhana other charity of the spiritual discipline is nothing but somehow keeping the mind at the feet of God somehow keeping the mind at the feet of God that is all enough now when we hear this or read this this is so important so simple just to keep the mind at the feet of God can we keep the mind at the feet of God all the time that is the question so this is really very important to keep the mind at the feet of God to keep the at the feet of God first and foremost you should have faith in God the existence of God we should have a faith complete faith in the existence of God then only the first is we have to one should develop the faith in the existence of God there is God and I having complete faith now I have to keep my mind at the feet of God mind that is thirty not the body not the gross one so subtle one I am going to keep at the feet of God mind at the feet of God what will happen in the bhagavad-gita in the language of our Gita the Krishna says Chaitra Chaitra a on the manifested this universe and the spirit that is behind this manifestation the Chaitra young that is the God the spirit behind this manifestation and this manifestation these are the two things if we keep the mind on the manifested thing so obviously our mind will never go to the subtle to God so this is the fast tape of sadhana or spiritual discipline very fast eve of sadhana is to understand this thing these manifested universe is so easy to understand and so attractive but this is false temporary and therefore my mind should be always on the higher plane on the supreme plane what is that we don't have much idea about that can you close this door so this is very very important millions and millions of they call it faithfuls they are all believed in God they like to realize God they like to go to God so many are there but how come that very few they understand this thing because the first and foremost thing we do not understand this universe this world which is so close to us is completely false and we have to take our mind somewhere else to the God and what is God that we will discuss afterwards but not this world that is for sure this is the first thing let's make it in a simple we can go to directly to the description of the spiritual practices given by Vedanta in the Tantra in one way it says in the bush never be another way Christianity two things faith and prayer Islam same thing faith and prayer Hinduism varieties are there but Vedanta says very categorically sadhana shahtoosh taya for Joe to stay amines for and what is that sadhana spiritual practices I am discussing this a little bit because this is important in our life we are here we are reading we are practicing because again and again and we read from I am not telling you I directly read from the ceramic rish 'no how important that in our life and we are not ordinary decks Ramakrishna will do he says the only spiritual practices we have to do here we come to and the Vedanta is coming to help us with these what is the spiritual practices vedanta says sadhana shahtoosh attire only for what are those southern earth and then they say be bigger fast then Veda gear Viveca means discrimination by rakia dispassion then should shampoo t6 tracers spiritual treasures then momusu 12 desire to be liberated these are the only four things in the BBA car what is the D vehicle the discrimination what is the bechara that we have to go on judging Nakia Nakia bus to be Vega again and again Shankar Acharya in his book also and many other parenting treatises it says nithya Anita was to be vehicle only two things are there just as you mentioned in the bhagavad-gita Chaitra Chaitra gap sheiter means the field shatter again field means the manifested thing whatever we see behind his manifestation what is there we find here the master Marshall after conversing with the ceramic isne one night he stayed in the dictionary itself and in the night he was just taking a stroll in the road that particular path by the side of the ganga one side the Ganga is flowing another side the panchayati and all other things she was thinking in in his own way and they're very interestingly he is thinking is it possible to realize God the master misha is thinking let me read from here can one really see God the master says it is possible he says that if one makes a little effort then someone comes forward and shows the way we read from Bhagwan see ramakrishna just now he was telling that if you anyone practices that one can certainly see God through the practice of spiritual discipline the vision of God is the only goal of human life then he said if you practice only a little someone will come forward to tell you the right path that is the main way see then now he is pondering the sadhana Tichenor told him in the daytime and now in the 90s pondering meditating on those teachings can you one really see God the master says it is possible he says that if one makes a little effort then someone comes forward and shows the way well I am married I have children can one realize God in spite of all that there's a very valid question for the householders is it only possible for the moms who have left the heart the norm or for the householders also reflected a while and continued his solid hockey master the three Hmong master mihashi continued he was reflecting thinking pondering meditating discussing within himself the teachings of sri ramakrishna he mentioned something and he was going on thinking that is the way one should practice and here the mast master Masha is reflecting surely one can otherwise why should the master says so you would have said those who are married they won't be able to realize God is it known anyone can see God by practicing spiritual discipline so that means everyone is within that anyone can do that why shouldn't it be possible to the grace of God self confidence is coming faith is coming then he is telling here is the world around me in the night he was looking around and thinking the Sun the Moon the Stars the living beings and the twenty-four cosmic principles how did they come into existence faith he is developing through which are through discrimination he's trying to understand faith means I said this you believe it no see Ramakrishna said there is a God you have to believe and now he is arguing with an inside is it possible Denny's arguing so many things in this world is manifested world the Sun the Moon the living beings the stars the 24 cosmic principles all these things how did they come into existence somebody must have created it who is that creator what am I to him this is the question the what is there who is the creator what is this world what is the relation between the creator and the creation that is a very very wonderful this three steps questions and then only the spirituality begins with these three questions otherwise nothing then he says that life is indeed vain without these knowledge what is that knowledge who is the creator and what is this creation and what am I to him why he have created me and why all these things this question that should be answered and life is in vain without main death then he'll be talking about ceramic Isner but here Sadam o krishna and good master ma che having the discussion Sadam o krishna he said anyone can realize God by practicing the spiritual discipline but the very first thing is you have to have a failed then as we were discussing the sadhana jet Estrella in the Vedanta and the very traditional way they say the BBB regurgitation patema moksha what is this Viveca discrimination that this the world that we see is nothing but temporary each and everything is temporary something is leaving for maybe thousands of years thing is only for minute but everything is temporary second is if it is temporary what I am going to do with this I'm also temporary this people are temporary we are constantly thinking that some people should clap when I speak when I say something when I think when I dance when I perform something there should be cow to appreciate me but what is this crowd temporary people so obviously the history is the best teacher when you see their huge castles and other kingdoms all the great history that always speaks about that the great the kings were at the now nobody bothers about them so everything is temporary and then comes by nadya the if it is temporary I want the permanent want something permanent what is that permanent that I have to inquire then the six thing that I must develop shall sham potty shut means six what is the Shama controlling of the mind Shama means controlling of the mind then Dhamma controlling of the senses o poor opee that means we drawing the mind from the worldly things that is opera p TT Keyshia forebearance so many things will come but I have to go on bearing it for the sake of God God is there in the life of all the sage and sages this operative and petechiae then stirred the serta means the faith and comes some odd on some other means listening and concentrating the mind on the brahman of the god there is some other the final decision what is the decision God is the and I must dedicate my mind on that these are the six treasure if one having the six treasure Shama Dhamma purity deeksha sada Shah Mardan in Sanskrit then controlling the mind controlling the senses and withdrawing the mind from the temporary things like that if it goes on the six qualities treasured when you get that means we are capable to realize God this is called sadhana the shutterstock could be along with these finally another thing comes to grab the power supernatural power the moment you will practice this thing supernatural power you come you can read the mind of other people you can change them anything Ramakrishna will tell now what happened to him what ever you think that will happen whatever so naturally the tremendous control over the mind otherwise some people is saying something immediately the Vengeance that anger will come I am going to punish you you're destroyed whatever you have earned that will be destroyed immediately so tremendous control over the mind but thou could destroy all these people Krishna could destroy himself he has shown that toward Juna I am NOT walking waiting for your help Arjuna I just want to give it to you so that you get the name and fame you become the hero but I have done already only limits the martyr above us abuse our team everything I have already done you just become the the machine in my hand then all the name frame will come towards una so here it says in that way so obviously one must be very careful and only thing that can give us that break that control of mine how mama kept wha the desire to be liberated so fast vivica vairagya shutter Shumpert II then the main thing is mine should be forcefully directly to God though I am having so much of power but I am NOT going to do anything utilize those things for either for the betterment of people all for destroying those people giving the punishment nothing I am NOT going to do anything because whatever has come the God's power within me I want to direct it to God so this is the faith now Saddam Krishna is telling if you are here you are my very own now he is going to those people who are coming to him you are my very own my relative otherwise why should you come here so frequently see how see Rama Krishna is identifying and giving as so much of importance to us encouraging us what is this what is the ceramic is not a principle at the principle some ideologies ideas are manifesting to a personality that is Ramakrishna what is that ideology realize God see God in this very life and that is the ideology and when we are going to accept that ideology what happens we are going to that particular person who has practiced that manifested that realized that so obviously we are going to that that means we are attracted by those ideologies so and those ideologies are giving us the examples of God manifestation of God glimpses of God so we are going to him and here see ramakrishna says you are my own my relatives imagine and again he will say the same thing and afterwards you our very own my relative otherwise why should you come here so frequently while listening to the kitten I had a vision of Rakhal in the midst of Shri Krishna's companions in the Darwin now he can he's telling that how it happened why he is to love so much the Rakhal means afterwards Shami Brahmananda denise's nor indra belongs to a very high level Shami Vivekananda no one has come can be compared with not in the nod to his very high level then he is mentioning about one young boy used to come from Sindh the present-day Pakistan Bashir Anand I wrote a small vibed Rafi on the Quran and when I was in Bombay a research on that and then I wrote that book there's a here Anand he says how childlike his nature is but he is not mentioning like Rakhal or Narendra he is appreciating a runnin but here Ananda is not belonging to Ramakrishna circle he was the disciple of Kasab the Brahma Samadhi and he started that Brahma movement in Sindh but he was a childlike simplicity he was having so see Ramakrishna is appreciating he came but Salam o Krishna is not mentioning that I saw him in this group of that group no here again I once saw the companions of chaitanya mahaprabhu not in a trance but with these very eyes formerly I was in such an exalted state of mind that I could see all these things with my naked eyes but now I see them in shamili he is now as because he has withdrawn himself I saw the Companions of Jatin with these naked eyes why he is mentioning that to give them the fake I saw it it is Nikita I think I saw you there and Balarama to butter on boys and master Masha mind Renard Gupta I saw you there in the Balarama and Balarama and you in that group you must have noticed that when I see certain people I jump up with the start do you know why a man feels that way when he sees his own people after a long time so that means his own people are coming he saw in this Cape of vision and he told it to Maseru domine baby I saw the white skin people are coming to me and here in America and Europe all people are coming to see Ramakrishna long long back when it was impossible to imagine even but is they are coming to me really it is now happening I used to pray to mother crying mother if I do not find the devotees I will surely die please bring them to me immediately in those days whatever desire arose in my mind would come to pass then he is telling he wanted to plant it too silly and to fencing that he was just like a child and how I will get the all those things or the fencing next day he found all it is lying over there as if someone was going on supplying he is mentioning all these things in the state of divine exaltation I could no longer perform the formal worship mother I said who will look after me I haven't the power to take care of myself I want to listen only to the talk about B I want to field thy devotees I want to give a little help to those whom I chance to meet how will all that be possible mother then he said give me a rich man to stand by me and then both will Babu did so much to serve me when you read and we we compare that same thing almost in our lives we are having happening the some projects we take up when we think what will happen a wall will do it some people they come and they perform it in my life I have seen particularly this type of things in Aldama no one was there in under man and suddenly when we took charge over there no one's around suddenly one officer came he himself came and met and he said I am the disciple of swami ranganatham and OG i like to come and visit these Ostrom but what is this have you the very poor condition of the Asuma so he wanted to help his wife understood that we don't have good food so she started cooking for us we three four Swami's and another gentleman who was there as a brahmacari so all she's to cook every time every evenings is to bring the food to feed us we never knew them and how it and slowly one after another gentleman and the ladies they started coming there is to go from India and then there's two helpers one after another we had fifty orphan boys and fifty thousand rupees in those days in 1991-92 loan in the market fifty thousand long means it was huge amount for us what to do certainly one gentleman came I never I saw him somewhere in Calcutta in different functions I never knew him but he was such a rich man recently he still remembers me I am so grateful to him recently he has sent a book that he has written composed the stories the fabulously rich man qicang they're so humble and he told I like to stay in the stew actually staying in the after nothing is there where you are going to stay we don't have anything he said knowing man it almost forcefully stayed and after I think for five days I don't remember exactly when he was leaving he gave me an and sealed envelope and when I opened I found a fifty thousand check he signed the fifty thousand rupees I could immediately pay back all the loan and got free from that who is doing it I never knew that man I never invited him I never approached him how come that he came someone was are telling me is there anyone in the US Ramakrishna mission nowadays who can show miracle like I have shown the miracles if this is not miracle then what is the miracle one after another the health started coming whatever was necessary immediately that type of people came help them the left who brought them who inspired them they were not my disciples they were many of them they were not knowing the ramakrishna mission even but one after another they came what he was salam o krishna is telling in this book in this gospel many many of our Swami's have experienced that in their lives many of our devotees also whoever has taken up any work in the name of C Ramakrishna Shami riveted under they got all success where from the people came money in success game but only thing that is necessary to control the ego if you say I have done then all that you do Tron and if you say that God has done that you'll remain Shami Vivekananda in the old fashion he blessed sustainability' his disciple the Irish lady if I have created you perish he fate but if God has created you flourish that was the way he gave the blessings to sustainability' sister Nevada the winged to help the Indian women do get education in those days and she was so successful wherever he went all people they accepted him accepted her and everywhere she was successful how it was possible in that Indian society to a so close and they never wanted to look at those type of foreigners she was so friendly everywhere she was welcomed and now in the 150th birth anniversary all over India people are observing had this 150th birthday through a great pomp and this is what C Ramakrishna said whatever I say to mother the mother fulfilled he sees in this way because if you bring to God whatever you want everything he will get you see one day I saw the strange figure now he is telling to master ma che I saw a strange figure covering the whole space from Kali temple to Panchavati when he asked the master ma should you believe this anything can happen master Mercia dumbfounded almost remain silent with wonder the one something which was calling if you have already visited the dictionary you will understand punch avati and the kali temple is a almost quite a distance and something was covering that distance and see ramakrishna was asking must imagine do you believe this master mache remain silent and wonder and it was going on in the evening again again the master Ramakrishna was sitting on his bed and then they were reading a holy book buck Tamil a story many of the Indians they know there was a king named Jamal he was king loved Krishna with all his heart he followed with unfailing devotion all the rites and ceremonies associated with the adoration of Krishna whom he worshiped under the name of Shimada thundera sama listen there was the name of that that particular God that he is to worship completely satisfied with his own identity he never directed his attention to any other god of goddesses one of the inflexible rule of his devotion was to worship the deity daily till almost midday she would never deviate from this practice even at the risk of his own his wealth or his kingdom learning learning the secret and enemy king invaded the kingdom during the morning time because the whole morning he will be inside the shrine the morning hours Jaya's soldiers could not fight without his command then most of the capital that they surrounded yet Jamal did not come out of his shrine room his mother came to him and wept bitterly trying to persuade the team to fight then the king said calmly why are you so worried shamily under gave me this kingdom that means the God what can I do if he has decided to take it away on the other hand non will be able to do me any harm if he protects me our own efforts are in vain and actually the story goes on in this way in the meantime Shama Lucinda the datee himself had taken the King's horse from the stable and had ridden a fully armed to the field alone he faced the hostile King and alone destroyed his army having crushed the enemy forces the deity returned to the temple and first in the horse nearby to the temple jml on completing his worship came out and discovered the horse there panting and covered with sweat who has been riding my horse he demanded who brought it to the temple the officers declared they knew nothing about it in a pensive mood the King proceeded to the battlefield with is army and there found the enemy with the exception of their leader lying dead he was staring at the scene when the enemy King approached worshipped him and said please permit me to tell you something how could I fight you have a warrior who could conquer the entire world I do not want your wealth or your kingdom indeed I will gladly give you my own if you will tell me about the blue warrior Shama Lucinda your friend he said no sooner did I turn my eyes on him Dan he cast a spell on my heart and soul the king the enemy king could not fight with him Jermel then realized it had been none other than the a militia under that had appeared on the battlefield the enemy King understood - he worshiped Gemmell and threw his blessings received Krishna's grace the enemy King then the master after this reading was over the master asking master marsha do you believe all that he is asking do you believe krishna rode on the horse and killed Gemma's enemies Master Maj I said I believe that Gemmell Krishna's devotee prayed to him with a yearning heart but I do not know hit the enemy really saw him coming on the battlefield on a horse krishna might have come there riding the horse but i do not know whether they really saw him master - smile the book contains nine stories about devotees but it is one-sided also it abuses those who differ with his views sir here comes the judgment devotees are protected by God but that doesn't mean the God has to go riding on a horse to fight for 4 secondly if the god is visible to each and every one they will get poppy liberation so obviously here only the enemy King saw God and he was saved his life was saved if it is the story goes in that way and the enemy King was afterwards got the blessings of the Krishna because he was mentioning he was stirring the spilled on me and I couldn't see anything else but that blue warrior well you all come here so often the mosque islamic is my game telling what does it mean people visit the holy man at the most but you all come here so often what is the significance of that master marche remain silent when the ceramic is named replied himself could you come here unless you belong to my inner circle I stress on this those who are regularly coming to see Ramakrishna believe it all the furs belong to his inner circle this is very very important we have come at least to this level that we have started loving Salama Krishna it is not a matter of a joke really really we have done something very good in the past life so we have come to this now obviously why should I move is no mentioning this to make us aware about their achievement we have achieved a lot we have almost reached to the cement we have come so close to God and his mentioning could you come here unless you belong to my inner circle that means you all are my own relatives my own people and then he is explaining how close like father and mother the son brother sister so close relative means it's not that uncle heir others so close like the father-son sister brother so close I do not tell you everything now he is just making a joke I do not give it everything if I did would you come here anymore so I am not telling everything then immediately is telling once shook they went to Janaka to be instructed in the knowledge of Brahmin Janaka said first give me my feet because the Guru prana mean that you have to give but take the sukadeva so they were the son of the famous Vasudeva why should I give you the fee before receiving the instruction because arguing with the Guru Janaka laughed and said we do be conscious of guru and disciple after attending from Magana because it is all the same that is why I asked you to give me the fee first master ma che was soliloquizing as I already read can really I realize God then he was mentioning about ceramic Asia that is called fate as because he is closely watching see Ramakrishna now he is expressing over here his belief is thought about Salaam o Krishna Sri Ramakrishna is certainly the best of men now this master Marshall was English educated man he was not an emotional person he was also scholar in Sanskrit we read himself so many Scripture he knew lot about it not that simply he was emotional and he is telling like this he said see Ramakrishna is certainly the best of name in all my life I have not seen another great soul like him he must have seen God about see Ramakrishna it's very very difficult to judge a person contemporary and living with him seeing him every moment then thinking that he is a man of realization is very difficult because you see so many other things also the he is joking he is sleeping is eating his just leaving just like any ordinary person obviously when far after much after words when you read about him then you can say oh he was a godly person but when you leave with the godly person it is very difficult to accept him but master masha he was lucky and he was thinking in this way I have not seen another great soul like him he must have seen God otherwise how could we talk with God day and night addressing him so intimately as mother otherwise how could he love God so intimately such as his love for God that he forgets the outer world he goes into Shimada and he means like a lifeless cream again in the ecstasy of that love he loves and guys and dance and sings the master measure is observing akadama krishna and then remembering within himself and coming into a conclusion the ceramic is now himself is God is realized soul friends this coming Thursday there is the 25th May of this year is a very very auspicious day is it follow Harini Kali Puja T and this follow her evening Kali Puja means follow her Eenie today is Tuesday this Thursday on the after all over the ramakrishna mission they will be observing the follower in Akali - gyah follow holy means it means destroying the effect of the past dates the problem with us is the first karma and this is the goddess when we are praying too hard all our past Karma's are destroyed Allah hari me see ramakrishna worshiped Masaru domine baby as so received and that was in the the twenty-fifth main in 1872 something they know it is in June but mostly they are does the starter and the gemologist illing know it was on this 25th me and this thing afterwards again it will be the alluring this is a very auspicious day when most of the people they try to get their initiation spiritual initiation why on that day if you are getting initiation the believe the pain that all the past karma will be over so here we find the ceramic is not worship the mother master worshiped his own wife Marcia the money baby and ceremony they became and sat in his room and there was a Kali Puja going on in the temple everywhere follower any Kali Puja the same Kali in the different name sixteen that names are there the different way it is worshipped and see Ramakrishna he was worshipping this show Russia and he was praying Oh divine mother thou eternal gorging the mistress of all towers and the abode of all beauty and unlocked for me the gate of perfection his brain satisfying the body and mind of this woman do thou manifest thyself through hard and do what is auspicious this was the last thing that the Ramakrishna did in his long twelve years spiritual practices and this was the last practice he did and gave everything including his rosary and he prostrated before his own wife Martha the money David and dedicated himself also a target so this is very very auspicious and very interesting Ramakrishna mission they did it he offered her worship with 16 items as one does the for the divine images all to the worship holy mother was in a state of semi absorption and at the close of it deep Samadhi the description that has been given on that the master too was in an ecstatic mode while doing the worship daivam budva daivam GG both of them they went into that level of divinity and by the time it came to an end he also was absorbed in Samadhi both the worshipper and the worship both was in Samadhi doesn't that transcendental union of the spirit the worshipper and the worship realized they're identical of being as existence knowledge and please long time vast almost the whole night then the master regained a little physical consciousness and he designed himself completely to the divine mother and in a supreme act of consecration offered to the Gaetti manifest before him the fruits of his all austerities he gave all the fruits of masters austerity and mother then he was uttering this mantra Oh goddess I prostrate myself before thee again and again eternal consort of Sheba or three-eyed the golden huge the dwelling spirit in all the giver of refuge the accomplishes of every end and the most auspicious among all auspicious object the marquis was worshiping the mother in that right the master invoked in march are the money day be the presence of divine mother the supreme energy that was manifesting itself to his own personality that is the most important thing that happened in the Ramakrishna mission history and this is important because he worshiped the ceremony DBAs goddess sure she does the RDR Shakti primordial energy and it is very different type of names and we know some of the names like Kali tarah Shiraishi Bhavani Cheri chin da Mosta breathable Tamati Begala Matangi Kamala his team names and is are well known ramakrishna worshipped only Bhatia the knowledge with the Ruffini baby llama krishna mission belongs to the tsunami subbu kya and this doesn't only sampradaya puri Giri Bharati tilta vana or Ania per birth awesome saga and Shiraz Shetty this sampradaya all Hindu sanyasins they were already there Shankar Acharya made them these differences our title became puri Ramakrishna mission because totapuri initiated Saddam o Krishna and since Ramakrishna puri and then we are also our last title should be pulley like show me a shot Miranda Puri but just for simple sake we drop that name number that's Puri again only a short Malanda so this way we go and here we find that each and every the monastic set this personal example they're very important in India here anyone can come with a guru a cloth and claim that I am a sannyasi but in India you cannot do that because only the sauna mean sampradaya they are actually having the Shankar Acharya lineage and they're highly respected our original motty's Puli sampradaya not and swing jury is our headquarters singly in South India and the sampradaya has the goddess goddesses presiding deity of the Puri sampradaya is Kamakshi baby I am just giving you this information because that all happened this Kamakshi Devi the temple of Kamakshi baby is at Kanchipuram in South India most of our Swami's they like to go to conceive um to have the darshan over there but inside the temple Gary Scholesy though the name the Kanchipuram that that is Kamakshi Devi actually inside the temple the deity is shoulder she multi of the day be the other names of the shirisha baby is Raja Rajeshwari Tripura Sundari or three Vidya so mother mass or Domini Devi actually three big deer thus sri vidhyaa is a goddess of knowledge and she is having the power to give both knowledge ease knowledge of spirituality and also the knowledge of this mundane world so that is why see Ramakrishna is to call her Saraswati the goddess of learning thank you for coming today is a very bad weather is constantly raining and foggy the many of our people couldn't come but whatever this is a wonderful thing every week when you meet when you read this book when you discuss is the real guidance in this midgel path so whenever anyone is really interested in spiritual life I always suggest go through this gospel of Sayama Krishna because all the answers are there and after reading the gospel of cinema Krishna always everyone develop creating God and the other ones ramakrishna say once you develop faith in God through faith God is there everything is achieved but unless and until we realize God we experience the living presence of God the complete faith will never come so that is the reason we have to go on reading pondering practicing praying meditating then only that complete faith will come and once the faith has come everything is achieved let us offer this pranaam to God in the form of the human beings Raghavan see Ramakrishna me Sanjana medium Ananta roopam popped on compa grita become by Aisha wat arum para Misha medium term Ramakrishna Shira sana mama oh the Chandi Chandi Chandi hurry he'll that's earth sweet Amish now our eponymous to
