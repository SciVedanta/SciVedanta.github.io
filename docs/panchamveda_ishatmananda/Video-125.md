[126: Panchama Veda 126 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-_NqKAdCTQ)

tavo khatam britam dr. G venom Kobe very rhythm calm asha pom shravana mangalam srimad athim booby green on da buddha iono the last time we were hearing listening to the discourses particularly the advices ramakrishna was giving do that devotees and in one point of time he say to be jeaious noguchi me surrender yourself completely to God but before that it was the discussion was going on and ceramic rishni was talking about the different type of activities that he said one should see ramakrishna advice that one should know the real nature of samsara so there are two things that the air one is spirituality God another is samsara this jagath now the moment a person is stepping in the spiritual life this is the basic knowledge that he should have this is a war which is temporary there is another world which is permanent that is spiritual life now that is mainly now some people not some majority of the people they practice religion different type of religion different type of things they observe in the name of religion is the short of a protection from the providence from the god not that they like God not that they like to go back to God not that they like to realize God so this is the difference between the devotees and that makes the grade among the devotees the here see Ramakrishna is very sincere and he whoever he is meeting is first and foremost thing being an avatar to tell people the truth that you were suffering because you have some desire and from this desire if you go back to God then he will get all the joy your life wants joy your life wants to a continuation of all these things eternity all these things you will get if you go back to God that is the whole teaching now he said to the the last time we were also reading and there he gave some example so that people can remember first he talked about a jackfruit he said if you break a jackfruit after rubbing your hands with oil then it is sticky milk will not smear your head now sometimes some people the they were working normally and all this thing life was going on but he were not satisfied what to do what not to do certainly a book comes into their hand one lady wrote to me and she is mentioning now she is reading the my ricotta and she is thinking as if the mother is guiding her in every step so why these because the condition of the mind when our mind is ready to understand then it is ready two hundred otherwise it is impossible and all other things that we see and if we go into that now of course we have to come back once again here to continue there is nothing wrong but the thing is we are not understanding the real the purpose of our human life so cinema Krishna is giving this example that you must apply Rob the oil in your and what is the drubbing the oil the knowledge the knowledge about the samsara for small little little thing we are part of disturbed agitated and we do so many wrong things just because of the wrong interpretation of the things so that is the saddest part of our life we have the tremendous intellect but at the same time somehow because of the Maya the bee damn thing to say because of the Maya we are deluded we forget and here ceramic ishness giving an example for the ordinary people nowadays the modern society won't understand perhaps but in the village life people they knew in those days the brick a jackfruit means you have to have that protection rubbing the oil in your hand otherwise the sticky milk will be in your hand it will be so difficult so this is the example if you go to the world and try to do that the work the things naturally you'll be affected by jealousy anger and many other desires and ultimately suffer then he gave an example of two monks they're both our moms but one is very clear about his ID goal another is not so both are monks they have renounced the world both are going to a city as if he is giving an example both of them they went to the city mostly in those days the monks used to leave inside the jungle in the cave when they have come to city it is something very curious so both of them were interested to go round to see what is happening all over one without going and booking a a place for his own stay he was going on seeing those things what happened ultimately he was not getting a place to stay so naturally of after this enjoyment he was in pain he was misery he was in difficulties but the other one he first went and then booked a room kept almost those things then came out free what does it mean through the story ceramic is telling understand the truth fast go to God realize God then come back and enjoy the whole life there will be no problem for you then so these two examples and third example is giving and that he is the abode hooter and he's telling this Abu due to the great personality he actually chosen the Guru's from the nature 24 gurus we all know about the Voodoo thur and then he was telling about the Abu due to that the kite and the crows this kite he got a fish and he was flying the clothes all chased it and then finally he had to give that fish up and then the clothes wait for the fish kite was alright then he understood able to to observe that and said oh that means if I have the desire and also that we share these different objects naturally all these things will come to me and all the problem will come so free from desire and one should work with care work should not bind him that is what the ramakrishna staging without work we cannot remain the desire is the cause of all bondage and misery but one should have to work because of the nature nature will force that we must have to work when I we have to work with work in such a way so that we are not bound by that now that is the greatest challenge for the ramakrishna mission monks in the traditional longs they don't have any work so in it is still now there are many many are there who is not having any organisation any bindings and he any responsibilities they move from here and there whatever food the gate wherever they can lady they just spend the time over there like this they move their free we can think that they are not having the anxiety or the desire are they they may be having another problem because they are thinking next day what I am going to eat where I will get the food so well a little bit of shelter all this different type of thoughts first secondly they are not having any organization but still you cannot be all alone there are other people are also their different type of people so obviously the different thought Karen's all those things are still there they are not working as such but still they are in the same way bound and then here this is the problem so we must have to work but we should work in such a way that we are not bound that is the teaching of ceramic ISNA and we find in the bak two Romany the greatest advaitha with Anton Shankar Acharya he is in the 327 slow curve the BBH Romany he is giving this sankalpa budget the smart servo on ortho Cohanim sankalpa means desired berjaya give up the smart therefore therefore give up all desire because sarbo on Arthur carnem that is the root of all problem that is the Shankaracharya see if you don't have the desired in there is no problem if you are expecting the result of your work bandage is the problem so that is what Shankar Acharya say then we know in the bhagavad-gita it goes on giving one after another the step-by-step how the problem is coming in the second chapter 62 and 63 slow core it says diet obj on boom sha it goes on on the first is the company of the object we just see an object or touch an object or be near to that object and we start loving that object then the inclination generate and from the inclination develops the desire to have that possess that and from the desire baguettes anger if I can't get that even after getting if somebody is just coming to share so do the anger and anger from the anger comes the delusion then loss of memory that destroys the discrimination and finally the ruin so one up to another the step-by-step the data has given the wonderful psychological this the medical explanation what is the problem in the yoga vashisht a very famous book in the theatre philosophy it says yet kinkead apiece ankle part Nora Duquesne emerged jetty again the South sankalpa son Calvin is the desire you had King cheetah p even if there is a very small desire is there neuro Duquesne emerged jetty then the human being then Mars in the sorrow do can immediately so everywhere the that is the teaching now as maximum possible i am practicing that is the different thing but the truth is this Satya is this if we want to get the eternal joy the eternal please one thing we have to give up and that is called desire that is also teaching of the mass are the money day be so this way it goes now kimchi the peace uncle path sukam axiom a snow day again that yoga bar sister says knocking cheetah be single path if you don't have the desire then what happened sue come Akshay em akshay sugar and there is no into the joy axiom sukemasa the free from all desire one gets eternal bliss so this is the ultimate now whatever the capacity I am having accordingly we have to try to reach to that not that this very moment I have to give up everything is the preparation and that is called sadhana ceramic ISNA ascertain that nish karma karma hollow if you are practicing miss karma karma that is good what without any selfish motive is good we cannot stop doing work and when we are working if we have nishka more karma karma miss desired whenever we are doing something without any desire without any motive selfish motive then it is the good how can one be free from desire that is the question it comes then we find that Rishi vashisht yoga varsha stir that receiver sister is telling to the Sri Rama Sri Rama is asking this question to his guru you yoga receiver sister then he said Rama SWAT mo bicharo I am he o rama you go on discriminate bichara within your mind Who I am where we am I see a meaty roopika her and then he will come and slowly slowly cheetah do drama be just yeah chitta chitta means the repository of all thoughts that is the tree there's so many things that they are all the desires are accumulated in one place the honey Donna's Rita that will be burned down if you can burn down all the desires then the seed won't be there seed of the desire all be there so there's a different way the giving the example is that fifth chapter first loca the yoga vashisht it says Oh Rama discriminant the seed of desire then cinema Krishna in one place said when love of God is awakened what drops away of itself now how to give up the desire and when there is a desire there is a work when I work the result comes when the result comes because of my desire it binds and when it binds again the birth and death circle I go this is the whole problem not to go out a spiritual life means what idiotic Jeevan at the Atma given that we say spiritual life the religion all these things we are listening thousands and thousands of years and what is that actually it comes from the desire desire lessness when desire it takes to the samsara when you go to the samsara then there are so many waves of happiness and misery and when you go to the spiritual life it is the eternal peace now the choice is ours when we take this choice choose this one that I will go in this way ok now that shall we completely leave the household life each and every one all the people of the world should become monks giving of all desires Shami become it is impossible is not possible because of different type of temperaments at their minds of the air Swami Vivekananda give a very practical suggestions he says in Bengali he said topper shefali shanty Asha our party karma collectible shy now tapasya that is the spiritual practice please do spiritual austerity that is called tapasya tapa and when someone is practicing that spiritual discipline then he gets that divine power shakthi the divine power it comes but again he said working for the other without in his self-interest is the temperature so this is that we we have to work because it is in our nature he can stop now he said why not turn it that energy which is forcing you to do some work do it for the betterment of others without any interest then that will be itself is tapasya spiritual practice and that will give you divine power so that is vivekananda's suggestions and here see Ramakrishna say when love of God is awakened what drops of of itself the love of God is not a matter of joke it's a great thing it's so difficult to get the love of God then if God makes some men were led the work now he is suggesting in this way ultimate Swamiji said to the work we can go but the work should be without any interest then you can develop the spiritual power then when that spiritual power comes it takes you as the induced the belief one to the knowledge another to the devotion salam efficient at this moment talking about the devotion and he is telling the love of God when it comes what is this love of God again it says there are three types of love of God one is some eartha another is someone Jessa and third is Soderini when his samartha love for love's sake that's called samartha and the literal translation of the this a Sanskrit word samartha means is capable he's so powerful that he is not asking anything from God I just love you so we saw so that is this is the debt was there in practice in the life of swami vivekananda is to come to see ramakrishna see Ramakrishna's to like him so much every day used to wait that not in the north will come it continued suddenly a ceramic ishness stopped talking to be waken under not even looking at him it happened that way so naturally we can understand when a person is giving attention to me certainly he stopped so why why is not talking what's the problem we are naturally you think in that way well not in going to the young man of 18 19 years can imagine that too totally as you call in match your mind but he was spiritually so developed used to come used to listen to see ramakrishna's words and ceramic ISNA is avoiding him that also he understood but still used to come after almost a month as a long period then see Ramakrishna suddenly asked him hey I don't talk to you why do you come here casually he gave the answer said I love you like you so I come whether you like me or not it doesn't matter whether you love me or not it doesn't matter whether you are giving attention to me or not that doesn't matter to me I like you and that is called samartha because he had that tremendous mental power most of us we are so poor so weak we always wants to get their attention or the support and then only we feel like going over there otherwise not but this is the ideal that I like so whether they are liking it to me or not it doesn't matter so that is called samartha someone just saw in between and Soderini it mostly that people become the solder and ebrima love for God maturity of the people merely send millions to go to God the love God they can sacrifice their life for God they can take the life of other people also for God all these things are Soderini why there is a lot of ignorance about God but still there is an attraction for God so this Soderini salmon jasa they have understood what is actually in the God but still could not develop that intense desire to see God so here see Ramakrishna is telling you see when bound by ties one is Chiba when bound by ties means desire and when free from ty's one is Sheba why the human being is so important why the God is coming again and again in different places I was just writing an editorial for our the coming here is in Chicago calling giving this this a desire to see God the surge eva is becoming Shiva if you you are not having that quality then we will never and ever come to the temple of the church or mosque or anywhere for that the node the animals or birds are desiring to go to a holy place do they then ever millions of people also never care even if they are living so close to the very horrible places even they don't care but some people they go why because through the experience of life they have reached to that particular point there they are feeling either knowingly or unknowingly a desire to realize God to desire to go to God and this is that is called our Jeeva trying to become Sheba how the jiva will become Sheba if the potentiality is not there that's why it says potentiality is there only when the ties what that the ties desires are not there that very Jeeva will become Shiva the next thing that very moment if the drives are there all the desires are gone immediately did Shiva so that is the uniqueness they sometimes they talk about the poppy they talk about the sea nerves I went to me in a group of religious leaders they were discussing about the scene I told what is the scene there is a mystyx only why do you call it a scene it's a mistake why missed it because ignorance the moment we understand that there is no ignorance there is no mistake there is no desire that very moment we become Shiva last time in our retreat on tantra the jiva according to Dame is pursue and pursue in having some desire the bind by those this is ceramic richness a and he was telling you know there are some shame hatred fear cast pride and secretiveness these are the bondages that ties they they bound so before I am so feeling shy to go to God I am shy to tell people that I love God I like God so that is also a bondage sometimes some people they are feeling their feel shy to tell that i am going to temple some work is there so i am going secretly they will come why because maybe the friends they will say something they are afraid of that so that is first of all one occurs of tea Bertie is single-minded devotion to God like the devotions of your wife Exeter the single-minded devotion to God this is very important what is bhakti now we have a curiosity about God some people they come the seed they try to meditate at the really devotee know that curious about god what is that but in so one pointed single-minded devotion to God and how it is possible to develop the single-minded devotion when I have a faith with how the faith comes either direct perception or inference so there are six different ways to understand things to prove things but the first is direct perception if it is not an inference what is the inference they are all great Souls i have read their lives or i have seen them i have made them and i have seen how wonderful life they are leading that means they must have got something that gives me a faith and that develops the devotion and slowly slowly when I come when I read the biography when I ponder over there to go on meditating on that a devotion develops then that is called some accident okish nuh said that is bhakti single-minded devotion through such devotion wants mind and soul merge in him H capital that means the god and after that comes the barber that is the second state when the cam Baba intense love true Baba a man becomes speechless he's not currents are stilled kumbhaka comes by itself so we cannot imagine that type of love for God that's called power our love for God is very very temporary and most of the time it is absent sometimes we are thinking so that is only Soderini that prima then slowly slowly when it becomes the single-minded we don't think anything else but God when that is also there that is also a step and pop that beyond that that is called the power so that's why I always say that one should read the Gospel of solano Krishna we get the all sorts of information about the spiritual world so the particularly in the mind some people are just going to the temple and dancing and cry crying the tears are rolling down and we feel old so much thing that he has a chip of course he has I did but that is in comparison with this huge world is nothing he is giving a man who has actually passed through everything experienced everything he is giving the first hand the account of these and he says that is called Harbor but after father there comes prema and this prema prema is sorta club it is impossible to explain and when the premar hooked he comes see Ramakrishna said the shaitan had that love prema bhakti tamta and mamata these are the two things we find in those who were having the prema bhakti so bhakti that is the devotion single-minded devotion for God didn't come bhava then prema bhakti salam o Krishna is giving that way tomtom to me I have to take care of God otherwise we will look after him that is type so he goes in such a way that I have to take care of God baby Krishna baby llama so the Yashoda Radha daboki go is they were having this type of devotion there's called prema bhakti and mamata without me he has no one to god they are thinking in this way without me he has no one if I don't take care not that they don't know God but the love for God is so much so they forget that God is all-powerful the oldest thing I had to take care of God that is called the prima octi and that has no comparison one forgets the world one even forgets one's own body which is so dear to man we remember we can those who have already started the life of biographies of the director circles one of them he was escorting march or other money devi and mother was going in a that tears the Bullock cart and it was dark the road was not very they couldn't see anything when you re was doing in the front of the card suddenly he saw it was night the mother was living inside and suddenly they that disciples saw that there is a another depression and naturally when it will go there will be a jerk and me that mother sleep will be disturbed so he say to that person who was driving the that blood kurti said I will lie down over there you just roll over my body I will try it doesn't matter but mother's sleep should not be disturbed can you imagine the the height of love this nothing even a person is getting up because of the jerk from the sleeve again she can sleep too why I have to sacrifice for know even for a second she should not be disturbed so it goes to that prima bhakthi ready to sacrifice even the I for the small thing of course the mother the Divine Mother immediately she understood the mind but that is the thing that proves she or she's always awake whatever we are thinking we are doing we are practicing we cannot hide from our that is the that is the proof she was sleeping apparently but at the same time the moment the disciple the Sun spiritual son thought that I should do like this immediately she got a bunch and she told why you are behaving like this is it anything matters that little jerk and for that you are going to give you a life never mind i will get down let the cross it and then again I will climb on anyway they cross that but the thing is this type of love this type of sacrifice why because this body is nothing and it will be a great thing to sacrifice this body for the sake of the Divine whom I love so see Ramakrishna he started singing because through the song you can bring that devotion and in the minds of the devotees oh when will dawn the Blissett day when tears of joy will flow from my eyes as I repeat Lord or his name he was talking about the prema bhakti shedding cabaeva hobby there is a famous song when that day will come the dawn of the day when I will cry for God then it goes on so he talked about the divine things in the meantime master Masha who was noting he noticed that in new batch of people in Turing and they were promised and some of them where Sanskrit scholars pundits they came and some government officials the Brahmas they were in those society they were age so they were having that pride we are educated people and pundits they are also that we are very very proud of their knowledge of the scriptures a Sanskrit and also the government officials the British government officials we can imagine the how they where now they are coming to salam Krishna and cinema Krishna is the father he is the spiritual father he is the Guru so obviously even without noticing them he is going on telling something to remove their ignorance he is doing that Baba still he was going on explaining when Arjuna was about to shoot n at the target the eye of a fish his eyes were fixed on the eye of the fish and on nothing else so we know that story that one is called the will was moving rotating and on the fish are made of wood that was hanging and the challenge was one who can see the reflection of the fish on a water part seeing the reflection if one can shoot and hit the eye of the fish that will give the proof that he is a great Archer and he will be given to the princes so Arjuna was concentrating on that on the reflection in the mint and their field is also going on so the concentration was that way and calculation that I will shoot without looking at the target only seeing that image over there that ceramic ISNA giving the example look at it the mind should be single mind one pointed concentrated as the arjuna he is that explaining when arjuna was about to shoot at a target the eye of a fish his eyes were fixed on the eye of the fish and are nothing else he didn't even notice any part of the fish except the eye in such a state the breathing stops and he experiences the kombucha in the yoga that we go for the kumba at a comebacker means a pitcher and pitcher full of water or Peter fuller per year and this body when you breathe in and then hold that inside without any movement that is called kombucha the terminology rach occur pooraka kombucha pooraka when we were inhaling reach occur when you are exhaling kumbhaka when you are withholding the air when the concentration becomes one hundred percent that people forget about the body and they forget about inhaling and exhaling and that is the condition of the Coombe burger so Arjuna's conditions ramakrishna is telling if you like to be successful in your meditation in your God realization then you have to be like that a friends we can understand how difficult it is because we ever has tried to concentrate to control the mind it knows the mind is full of so many varieties of thoughts whenever we are trying to concentrate thousands of waves of towards are carrying it away now ceramic Easton steering that you have to somehow develop these and then it is possible another characteristics of God vision is that a great spiritual current Russia shop along the spine and go towards the brain if then the devotee goes into Samadhi he sees God so he's giving the fast and experiences we have read in the book but has anyone practiced that and we find a person over here and that is the greatness of ceramic Krishna he practiced the path of love also yoga also guiana and bhakti and karma so all these four paths of the Hindus he has practiced all the religious faiths he has practiced then he came out and say it all these things so those not only the Hindus anyone wants to develop the spiritual life I think this is the guidebook he is telling that the characteristics of God vision how I will know that I am realizing the god it will rush through and Marge and then only seeing God then he turned to the Brahma devotees who had just arrived musta mature give that account the mossy Ramakrishna say to them mere pundits immediately he was telling them when he saw those people usually in those days people as do the pundits the San school scholars many of the most of them days to a very very egoistic person this to come and see it and keeping their right leg on the left leg to showing that there's somebody that was the the body language dish to show that you must know the time somebody salam o Krishna never liked the egoistic people and as because he is the Guru he never hesitated to tell this whole divided these people how they will mind acceptor and never cared for that immediately he said that mere pundits devoid of divine love talk incoherently then he is naming one pandit pandit schemata one seed in the course of his sermon God is dry make him sweet by your love and devotion imagine to describe him the God as dry whom even the Vedas declared as the essence of bliss they're so much ignorant but still feeling the damn pundit it makes one feel that the pundit didn't know what God really is that that was why his words were so incoherent then he is giving an example immediately as his own immediately is giving an example a man once said there are many horses in my uncle's cowshed from that one could know that the man had no horses at all no one keeps a horse in a cowshed some people pride themselves on their riches and power their wealth honor and social position but these are only transitory nothing will remain with you in depth so this is the truth may not be sometime palatable for many people because they like to listen to some good words about them Oh is a successful mandy is that surround Krishna is clear-cut spiritual so he never hesitates to tell the truth on the face of those people at the betterment of those people so if you are really seems here to realize God then this is the only guru I find in this modern world the God Himself he is mentioning in this way and these are the things simple but at the same time so difficult to overcome he mentions it there the world power social position but they don't know that did all this density nothing is going to so many of the people i have seen in a socially very high position having lot of power also wealth and so many even the learned people they will ever mention about all those things they're so humble that table people are also they're very very humble nothing will remain with you in depth so that is the ultimate thing one should remember and cinema Krishna again he's singing baby doc uman KO kar annoy me chhibramau boom on dolly baby the human q kuru knowing me to bhrama beaumond early that you are remember this o mine nobody is your own being easier wandering in this world so this is the truth no one can be her own and in different places ramkrishna coated different stories also the one husband used to go to a guru and say every times today my wife loves me so much sir you will never imagined she loves me so much love so much then the Guru said you like to get the test of our love why not okay i will give you one medicine the left-hand medicine the moment to pour a one drop you will lose all consciousness and as if you will be gate to the external world but you will be conscious to listen to conversation the people will be doing there and whenever you'd like to come back to normal life put that right hand you don't forget this so the man two can he light down the bed and took the left and one then after some time he could understand the life is crying calling people the neighbor scheme and but the body of that man as if people are thinking he's dead but he was conscious he was listening it became so many folds it was so difficult twisted in the whole body in such a peculiar way it was difficult to take out from the room because you have to cut the door door was a small one then the people started telling now we have to break the door we have to make it the spirits open to take the dead body out then the wife was telling now the man has already gone we I'm not going to get him back then don't break the door because I have to leave in this room I needed or so his better cut his body into pieces and take it out then the man put the right hand that drop and came out to life and said guru was right you don't love me and here you are but this is the room that I constructed the door I constructed and now you are not hesitant to cut my body into pieces so that is the store even a funny way to make nobody is ours michi brahma boom on delay then it says pelona dakshina kali but the way my a jolly vein is you're wondering in this world trapped in the circle snare of maya as you are do not forget the mother's name in a simple translation duction akali as because this for the Western people readers they won't understand what is darshan akali so mother's very difficult to understand this real spiritual teaching and most of the people are afraid to know even this but this is the truth one must not be proud of one's money if you say that you are rich then one can remind you that there are richer main than you and others reaches still and so on and on at dust the glowworm comes out and things that is light the world but the pride is the cash to win the stars appear in the sky the stars feel that they are giving light to the art but when the moon rises the stars fade in shame the moon feels that the world smiles at his light and that it slides the art then eastern horizon becomes raid and the Sun rises the moon fades and after a while no longer seen is giving the example how one after another someone is thinking I am giving the light bigger bigger bigger and bigger if well the people would think that way they would get rid of their pride in their wealth this will because most of the people the moment the wealth is their money power as they call it the immediately with the money power you can buy the manpower or sometimes they named it a muscle power and when that is in your hand you can in light like to rule over others and those who are listening to you you are giving the shelter if not you're fighting with them all these things goes from the one thing that is the pride and by the end of the day what remains nothing and history of the human society teaches it I was observing how the Roman emperors other they were behaving the very powerful King but the moment the king is dead all the members of where their family was slaughtered the wives when everyone was slaughtered that peculiar system why the next man who is coming into power doesn't want anyone to challenge so kill them there no way to survive but where is now the Roman the infarct or where is the power nothing know where people go to see the reams and to imagine that there was once a great king is to leave so that is the truth so money log fade all the devotees nicely after all the talk the ceramic ISNA wherever used to go all is is to give this truth in a very simple way only the some fortunate ones could understand and those who understood god bless it so we will study again the last visit to Keysha in the next chapter in the next class but that will be the last class of this session because you know it is very difficult to continue this evening class particularly 730 but in the winter December January February March will
