toluca Tom rhythm dr. G venom Kobe very calm calm o Shah Bahama strana mangalam srimad artem booby Goonan te borre dodgin aha welcome after this winter break was a long break and we started reading this on februari forth 2013 that was the fourth february2014 march forth march two thousand thirteen we started reading this punchy movida which is actually the mind of spiritual knowledge this vida now they are they're published one gentleman one American young man is there he collected all these and then he has put it into the cds two cds now they are selling from our bookstore and containing 50 lectures all previous lectures that means 50 hours today after this winter break we will start hearing the master and he say oh god yeah when we study the doctrine of serum is nothing else but the spirituality talk about God and the very first thing on the Sunday februari eighteen eighteen eighty-three when the devotees came to him at the CH nature he said bow before God why because someone came and he was wearing before him but he said it is ok but bow before God it is God alone who has become all this ceramic Krishna is a devotee and he was worshipping goddess Kali mainly of course he was worshipping the Govinda the Krishna the Shiva but mainly the cali so he is telling who has become that means the God has become all this but in certain places for instance in a holy man there is a greater manifestation so the when a person came to him he touched his feet then he said bow before the God then he explained that the holy person is also equally if not in the manifestation in that capacity of the God but his manifestation of the spirituality much more so when you are going and robbing Darwin and paying respect to a holy person there is also good for you because through that person you are trying to understand the God and giving respect to God this manifestation means what this is the one question so whenever we talk about there's a people they say the reflection of the Sun on the glasses it should be always every time the same no it depends on the condition also suppose there is a mod on that particular glass so the reflection of the Sun will be less almost nil but though that glasses which a clean reflection will be much more and if that glass is a mirror almost the same or more reflection will be there so it depends on the condition the quality of the glass similarly in the human being also manifestation of god what is that qualities what is that qualities the mental quality spiritual qualities that is the beauty to understand ceramic ISNA every time through different way he's trying to point it out that spirituality is nothing but the manifestation of the all based good qualities that the human being is already having that that manifestation of the good qualities one young lady came she is very much concerned about the poor people she is trying to help in American also they go to Africa and she was having some question why people suffer so we were discussing that just before this class the sound of the Karma allow because that we have done some work and that result is coming to us either we are enjoying all your suffering whether you understand it or not accept it or not but that is the truth I was trying to giving her the example same moment the two lives are taking birth one in a rich family another in a very wretched poor condition family and right from the birth if you don't believe in the karma phala or in the past life why they in this person this life that kid in the poor family right from his birth suffering and why the other one is enjoying same moment in the same city maybe in the same house two different families two different example the sufferings and enjoyment why are listen until you go through the explanation of the cargo color and the past life you cannot explain it the past life is there so if we believe in the past life karma valla is there and if we believe in the Karma valla then the question comes why should we do good work to others helping others thinking about them by doing that with a humble mine devoted mine we are actually benefiting ourselves it is not the benefit of the others if we don't help them not that they will die they will survive only by helping them we are helping ourselves what is the basis of morality this but ultimately we have to believe in the existence of God and that is what Saddam aggression is telling these then except in this passages we will get the answer the wonderful questions that was put before bhagavan sri ramakrishna the question is revered said what are the doctrines of Vedanta we are sinners what will happen to us how can one see God say is it not possible to have the vision of God weed out the help of guru to these type of questions the very important questions and all these questions constantly it is coming in our mind also we listen to this also naturally the answer from the vagabond Saddam appeal and how he says he says sir what are the doctrines of Vedanta see Sri Ramakrishna never studied balanta not like us there's all the time reading the way they and the benicia than the other auxiliary books but he understood the real part of a tag just exactly he said the Benanti says I am he that is the whole of erotic the Vedanta say I am he brahman is real and the world illusion even I am illusionary only the supreme Brahman exist that is the whole of the Damned so many bathers so dominicana shots so many auxiliary books on beta and so many great Souls explaining on those things ultimately comes to what this thing brahma satyam it car Jeeva bromeaba na para that Shankar Acharya and he is the person actually who has explained so many and then ultimately he said I can tell you in a half a sloka sloka ordained aprovechar me I can tell you that in half a sloka yet oakton grunt ago TV he which the crore and crows millions and millions scriptures have said I can tell you in half its local not in a complete sloka what is that Brahma Shakti jagat mithya Jeeva remember now para the Brahman is truth but all this universe is illusionary that is what's ceramic ishness aight i am he even I is illusion design the eye when we say I is the body that we really mean that is also illusionary what is illusion that is constantly changing it's not permanent constantly changing but we are thinking that this is permanent so this is the illusion we know in the Mahabharata then the story when the Dharma he was asking the question to Yudhisthira and he was asking can you tell what is surprising something in the human life and he said oh honey honey boo tani got chunky I'm amundi rama when every moment people are dying but those who are surviving they thing i am not going to die they see people dying all around every moment but the thing I am NOT going to die and that is illusion Tomas charger at a Purim the this is the most surprising thing what else so this is the most surprising that we cannot understand this transitory things even the last moment so tonight some phone call comes this is sean which we like to give you some donation whatever we are having because we are on the almost dead bed so i like to give you all thing to you was okay when we let it give to the arch okay then when you are going to give now let me see when i died in only the after you're dead we will give it to me so i think no no no you better enjoy why should you die don't think of it rather when you are a live distribute whatever is necessary for the support of your life you keep and then you yourself mr. wood while you are giving to me yourself into it there are so many all around people and they'll be so happy anyway it is very difficult to accept this temporary nature of this life and that is called illusion and this solution I is the main illusion we are mine before my birth I never knew Who am I after my death I will not know who I Who am I so like this the eye is the most illusion and here bhagavati Ramakrishna save for the Kali Yuga the path of bhakti is spatially good he was asking about the Bellanca in the bed anta vida unta the last part of knowledge be the knowledge anta in the last part of knowledge is a hum brainwash me that part that is odd we didn't there is bc stood the Vita and Drita Vedanta again and in the data with antha they say that God is there i am here i can realize God I can reach God I can go to God I can listen to God I can talk to God so that way ceramic ish nough said Kali Yuga this present age so this path abductee is good one can realize God through of t2 because this knowledge that I don't belong is so difficult I am surviving i am going to go off wish I am working I am getting the salary i am doing these and that but at the same time I am thinking I am NOT it's very very difficult so obviously is only for a few people disposable the gana but for the hook t it is always good whenever i am coming i purchased some proves and sweets and bring for the god and then give it to god and then I take the Prashad so that way the God and me both our existing so there is no problem i decorate god I feed God and then I sings virgins to please him so many ways I can do that here ceramic ishness telling that but another person he is asking said we are sinners what will happen to us because in those days in Calcutta a lot of now is also a lot of Christian missionaries mostly the educated people from their school so they used to always learn C nursey nursey nurse so you were seen as it bricked actually the human confidence I am a sinner I Messina I can't do anything somebody I have to depend on so that way they always make them weak so Dharma the religion instead of making a person confident makes them weak so he is telling we are sinners he is confident that we are all sinners now he is telling what will happen to us but Saddam trishna is not in a mood to counter all the things previously and afterwards also in different occasion you will be telling why you are talking like that why you think that you were seen but here he says all the scenes of the body fly away if one chants the name of God and sings his glory to the simple solution very simple solution only what we have to do in a mother also is telling don't stop repeating the name of God just like the that the clock is moving every second like that you should go on repeating the name of God all scenes of the body fly away if one chance the name of God and sings is glory these two things together always he says chanting the name of God at the same time remembering the glory of God chanting and remembering what is the remembering the good glory of God the qualities of the God the person or the particular god or goddess whatever quality is there having the kindness broadness acceptance and also many in the ramachandran Krishna in all gods we get all those things and then if we go on repeating you say the hanuman chalisa rarity there are so many qualities of the hanumana those who are actually worshipping the Hana Hana they are supposed to get those qualities those who are worshiping sri rama supposed to get those qualities so this way again we find it says the Ramakrishna is giving the example water we reserve were dug in a meadow is evaporated by the heat of the Sun likewise the water of the reserver obscene is dried up by the singing of the name of name of glory of God so this is really important giving the example of the God that as the Sun is cold water similarly simply the name of God will dry up all the scenes all the scenes only need one a faith in the words of the wonky on Krishna and practice to repeat that this two things in me sames in the the face in the words of agawam serum krishna i am going to be purified because ceramic ish nuh said if i go on repeating the name of God that's where dicks is so important unless and until one who is getting there no this a few days it is going on so I am sorry if I am repeating the name of God as in the fashion of cinnamon is teaching that I am taking the name of God and that very name is so purified that i am going to be purified and who is this God the qualities of the God and that those qualities which naturally will come to me then it says you must practice eat every day so how to realize God how to get peace how to develop in the spiritual life these questions are haunting people are going here and there listening so many things but only if they read this pages of the Pancham aveda we get all the answer from the God Himself and here he says you must practice it every day the practice practice practice when you have practicing to taking the name of God then suddenly we see something we forget oh my god I'm sorry I forgot then he is not repeating the name of God but remembering it and then taxing to the one show me then see it happened to me what will then happen instead bring back the mind start repeating again bring back the dance called practice so if we could do it in one go constantly then it was very good as because we cannot do that no harm will try again in a game then a very important words in Arma Krishna is telling weep at least once to see God here is a very special type of words we never hear like this not even any bhakti Sutra whip at least once to see god weeping who can really weep when I am having that strong desire if I am having that strong desire and that desire is not fulfilled having a strong prayer that prayer is not answered so naturally I am really feeling that I am NOT getting all my answers all these things so that brings tears in my eyes God you have shown yourself to so so so many people if they have seen you could talk to you why not mean if I am NOT ready make me ready and you know the moment you are truck just thinking that you can give me the shin you can make a prepare my mind in that fashion in that way so that i can understand you if we cry like this once and for that we have to go to a lonely place everyone you cannot do that so these are the practices of spiritual upliftment how we can realize God by practicing these what one constantly repeating the name of God and remembering the qualities of God second once in a while at least once in a week if we can cry for God and to cry for God you have to be very lonely alone and sometimes we read in the life sama be bacon and the Narendra not dakshina she was very lonely and full of jungle so somebody hard that someone is shouting and crying praying to God not in the north just like a mad person he is going in the wood and crime master Masha himself also did like that in the date night he will go outside in the wood and there he'll be crying to God please come and bless me with your darshan so like that they themselves had practiced it not that they have only noted it so that is the way the Ramakrishna is teaching these then are the two means now he is summarizing these them are the two means practice and passionate attachment to God practice and passionate attachment to God this attachment is very important this attachment means when I am thinking about God when my mind goes to God I cannot think anything else but God and when I could not take the name of God or do thing about God that gives me lot of pain how could I forget God that is called attachment passionate at your attachment hearing the this ceramic ish kn--again it says there is another class of devotees you know this is the normal devotees they are trying to do it some people are they're very fortunate and he says that rapacity prefer seek the means he himself says that is to say those on whom the good he sends all of a sudden and who at once attained his vision and knowledge a signal the immediately attending the vision of God he has not practiced he never played he never wanted that particular person but the God out of his own selves coming and do that now if we go and ask still I was praying to you you never came to me how come that you have given us a son to me up question he's free will we can go and give it to him he in that is because deposit the creeper means the grace cig dia means the Blissett because of the god grace that's it I think I told you the story of that lady in a remote village in the north distance state of India one lady never hard about ceramic ich nur never saw the picture of Saddam additional and no question of remembering or calling or meditating a pre into cinema schnaa and one day morning she came walking a long distance along with our neighbor only to point it out to see Ramakrishna's picture and to tell that this man appeared before me this man appeared before me last night when I was sleeping now here when I was sleeping he came open me up and he said he go to cheer up on G and there is a Maharajah is there and go and tell what I am Telling to you he woke up not in green and then he was talking with cinema Krishna he found that whole room is lighted both of them came out cross the small that coat heared then open the gate that is opening on the road and afterwards when see Ramakrishna suddenly went away he started thinking who is this why he came and naturally and the villages they think that the ghosts and all that so he was very much she was very much worried go into the neighbor's house they decided very early morning they started and then asking different people there is to our a sama because these two call us maharaja so this people came brought them then that should in charge Swami to cut to the shrine and showed can you please point out who came in your dream and she excitedly before the question was a complete she pointed out to see Rama Krishna told this man came and the charm you are selling Tahu what is it we have left our heart and home only to get a glimpse of yours and you never came to us and we are doing every day and night chanting your name meditating on you performing your duties to only diseases but we never came to us this lady never wanted anything even knew about you as you don't care about you also whether you come or not since I you are so much graceful then of course this is deposit it in the vision and then see Rama Krishna stealing those who lead a householder life should practice spiritual discipline they should pray leisurely to God in solitude so this is the mainly for the householders in solitude they must go and practice and to that person who was asking questions see Ramakrishna said God cannot be realized through all should stripe or devotion to the lotus feet of God God cannot be realized through scholarship but the most many people are there those who are professors they are philosophers they're studying about all this they know all about this and much more but they cannot realize God why or chintia kahlua bhava no tom STAAR kena UJ eat it says in the Hobart this Baba this conception just pick turki just by debating you cannot understand it you cannot get it you cannot realize God just by debating but this is a achene dr you cannot think about kalu know it for sure giving this promise Ababa this conception conception of God infinity the glories of God how little can you fathom them can you ever find out the meaning of God's ways you cannot understand how God is working infinite of the glories of God then afterwards he is thinking Amen things I have practiced a little prayer and austerity so I have gained a victory over others this is another thing the moment someone goes and he is in front of God and offering food and of doing some aarthi he thinks I am pure of them Gao I'm holier than thou and I am close to God ordinary people they go and tell can you please pray for me why not you bring because that is what Serrano kitchen is teaching again and again don't take the help of anyone you go and pray because within your heart the same God is there not with their then another person is asking him how one can see God so God this question see Ramakrishna has answered in a different way in different time here he is in a different mode we can say he is answering not with these eyes how can one see God almost the same question he was answering first you have to go to sadhu sanga in the company of the holy people you have to listen from them listen to them and then you have to go in an erosion in a quiet place and then you have to contemplate whatever you have hard and then discriminate is it good or bad for you and then finally free so these are the four five steps he always repeated here he is telling completely in a different way confident that God can be seen but he said not with these eyes God gives one divine eyes and only then can one be hold him God gave Arjuna divine eyes so that he might see his Universal form in the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita the wish aruba that Arjuna saw that is because the God gave him the divine eyes your philosophy is mere speculation it is only reasons God cannot be realized that way the philosophy that always we are fighting with the philosophy only so all different type of groups in the different religions and they are in different way people are very very confident that only their path can take to the asked God and they don't believe the others will also reach to that same goal the other parts that they are following so that is the main problem for all the religions and now in this modern world in different places mainly in America people are trying to understand each other so the parliament of religion here in the soil of Chicago the first problem into religion was organized long back in eighteen ninety three and then they are trying and different groups are also coming up trying to bring this idea but they are not understanding philosophy is one thing realization is another thing i really i really feel if they study the gospel of ceramic ISNA the problems are solved and not that they have to accept ramakrishna as their ideology or as their God but they can understand and can accept and can utilize his teachings if he is speaking in D to a hearing not with these eyes but God gives the divine eyes God can be seen but with the divine eyes your philosophy is mere speculation it is only reasons God cannot be realized that way if we are constantly going on under trying to understand the God created these I am also like this so it will be like this the result cannot be one plus one equal to two every time it may not be too because in the gods rhythm it totally different God cannot remain unmoved now he says if you have the rag of apathy first he said bhakti and then the capacitor then now he is telling Raghav of tea this is a special kind of team God cannot be cannot remain unmoved if you have raga bhakti and that is love of God with passionate attachment to him love of God with passionate attachment to give this passionate attachment this is very important see sometimes we place the gods picture and then we worship God but doesn't believe that it is really God because eighty percent in the subconscious mind is only picture so we just do whatever you like I saw the other day the small Ganesha someone decorated Ganesha in with so many flowers the Ganesha cannot see what the eye is a covered not only that gone it is so difficult for Ganesha even to breathe because whole body is covered in that flowers the one he was having so many flowers what to do as a applied on the Ganesha but suppose you feel in that condition if somebody is putting two flowers on your two eyes and block your passage nose and then how you will fill we don't think like that when you are robbing we're up so gruffly we do not think that it must be God feeling so when we are touching it must be very very careful that's called a love of thee when the raga means a total attachment total love for God in that condition you were always alert that my behavior my action my ways should not heart God in any way some people will be going even after that very on the team so that there is no sound the god is sleeping so he should not be disturbed in balloon motive you gooo that is the tradition that was taught by the direct disciples of cinema Krishna ramakrishnan and the G bremen and the G this to see how you are offering the fruits can God eat at this big fruit if you are just putting like that will you be able to take given small piece but properly dressed so that if he wishes he can take it and test it let's call Raghav earthy even the banana when you are peeling you should not hold the banana with your finger rather you should do in such a way so it comes automatically on the plate because naturally and by nature it is covered the moment I am holding with my fingers is getting contaminated maybe so when I am offering the fruits on the plate that devotion called Raghava the-- that the raga work T if we are using applying practicing see Rama Krishna says raga bhakti is pure love for God a lab that seeks God alone and not any worldly end Prahlada had it is giving the example only I want God and nothing else at this very rare we know of almost impossible then he is singing though I am naval oath to grant salvation I hesitated indeed to grant pure love a bengali song translated into english and it says i am not hesitant to give Mukti liberation but I am reserved i am very hesitant to give bhakti because that you have to achieve through long practice I mean mocked EDT cart or knowing bhakti DJ Carter Carter means hesitant the gist of the whole thing is that this is the speciality of ceramic ISNA whatever he will say he knows that people won't be able to remember so again he will repeat and repeat the gist he says the gist of the whole thing is that one must develop passionate yearning for God and practice discrimination and renunciation these are the two qualities without which nothing can be achieved discrimination means bichara and that is very rare all people in the name of God and in the devotion they will be applying so many rules and regulation which is unthinkable how can you constantly offer food to God can anyone take or eat food every time all the time whenever anyone is coming we will offer is there should not be any timing but majority of our temple they do it why you know because they need money and they don't like to disturb the devotees who are bringing it rather let the god be disturbed no problem because he is not going to harm us immediately but that if the devotees are not coming so the only to satisfy the devotees constantly going on showing the light and offering food and these and that we do it regularly almost in every temple because we are not sure that God is there if I really felt that God is there naturally I will be hesitant how can I offer food every time whoever is bringing I cannot give it to there should be a timing as a human form human being we take in the morning maybe a little morning then of the lunch then in the afternoon then in the night that time we will offer keep it over here we will offer that particular time or once in a day we will offer it most of the Vedanta societies they don't practice this ritual istic team they explain about it so psychologically they are free but moment you think you are constructing a temple and you are putting the god over there and prana pratishta get the call that means invoking God to come and sit over there all these things you have to practice is not so easy so anyone having some money will purchase an image and nah no no I will pay for it don't bother you put the image over there and then who is going to clean the image that I do not know who is going to offer all fruits and the puja that you think only thing in a big way you must give the pluck that I donated that image so this is the devotion so if this is the devotion how can you expect that the God will be so happy so this ceramic ich nur is pointing out putting the finger on our eyes so these are the things the gist of the whole thing is that one must develop passionate yearning for God and practice discrimination and renunciation this discrimination is it good for the god can I also suppose I am there is it possible for me Marsh are the money DV some devotees came she was sitting over there for hours together and they came late and then they were offering pranaam and going on washing her feet and doing these doing that without imagining it is so late she must be hungry let her go and take some food and rest no so someone has to come and harshly tell the what you were thinking she is leaving similarly whenever we are coming to God we are decorating God so nicely and similarly we have to understand the God also enjoys yes so nicely everything should be neat and tidy there should not be anything else so that is called raga bhakti said is it possible to have the vision of God without the help of guru Sri Ramakrishna the answer is wonderful and he says sachidananda himself is the Guru first he says there cannot be any other guru why because to remove the darkness remove the ignorance what is the darkness what is that ignorance that is my ego that I always feel I am I I I because of that only all this problem can ad ordinary people do remove that ego the darkness that ignorance that's why she don under that means the God himself but here he is not telling the god he is mentioning about the brahmana the art money the consciousness shut cheese on under here he didn't use the word God mr. incana snas whom we call Brahman and sometimes we explained that such chidananda salut toi his existence his knowledge his bliss absolute such cheat on under he only can do he who is the Guru is also the Easter the mini is the pain that we need to God for my custom aim of God if the Guru has agree with you and that is the thing that slowly slowly slowly slowly civil which to God that is the way the human give you always help in the vivid to Romany if you read in one place is asking happy if there is a burden somebody is carrying on his head others may have maybe it's an organization to unload that garden but the burden of your life you have to do that no I and suppose you will seek you have to take the medicine if anybody else is taking the medicine on your behalf you're not going to get become cure so you have to take that medicine you directly similarly if you'd like to realize God if you like to get the blessings of God guru will tell you these are the things we must have to practice and do as he has already saved the passionate longing for God discrimination and dispassion what I'm going to do with all this when I was young I am aren't lot of money now that all my responsibilities are over what I am going to do with this now share it with the society so that is the way one should think here he is thinking is telling he who is the Guru is also the Easter the same this is why how come he's a human being and he can how can he be the Easter also because the consciousness the same consciousness and here he is the thread by holding which you can reach to the god then he says if you ask me which form of God you should meditate upon I should say fix your attention on that form which appeals to you most this is the speciality of Hinduism why we are having so many gods and goddesses so many different forms why not one many of the Hindu people now they are thinking so because they have grown up over here so they came and they were telling sean is you can't we remove all those things and make one that is that already some people practiced it's not you alone you are just thinking in some people that heart removed the all the forms of gods and goddesses and think of only formless god that is brahma samaj arya samaj prarthana Samaj all the samajh came in that 18th century 19th century beginning but that is not the answer they could not survive the answer is to understand why all this so many images only to help us reach a ver image you think that you can concentrate on you can love that is your God that your goddess so that is the beauty of the Hinduism sometimes we misunderstand but the vastness the freedom that the Indian has given to us fix your attention on that form which appeals to you most but no this is important but know for certain that all forms are the forms of one God alone all forms at the forms of one God alone it is a devotees their track so that they can have some bow and can discuss about the religion they are mainly trying to read the gospel of ceramic ISNA bhagavad-gita and all that and individual rooms individual houses it will be difficult so they went to a temple in the temple huge temple having so many rooms and one of the management he told her no problem you can come and sit in one room once in a week only you were coming there's no problem you need not to pay anything only clean that room that's all well the next man came in charge eat oh no no no it's not possible and that time I went they took me with great enthusiasm Swamiji we are going to do so they instead of those people they took me over there and told this is these this is that will be sitting over here putting tuck wherever here I told all that will do but who is the authority bring him talk to him see that whether they will allow not then when they contacted the gentleman came oh you have come you can't or i can see but we don't believe in any other God accept this so if you are doing some chanting or meditation or puja of this god can we were a lot otherwise I am sorry I told see this is Hindu so that is why because he could not understand the basic of Hinduism and he thinks that he is Hindu and the way he was walking it could though every step was proving that he has understood the Hinduism and he's very proud of it god help him and bless him but the problem is that narrowness creates all problem and cinema Krishna the embodiment of parliament of religion we are now talking about parliamentary religion is the embodiment of parliament region and he says these and I conclude friends with these neighbor Harbor malice towards anyone never Harbor malice towards anyone all the same thank you very much for coming in this evening from now
