[177. Panchama Veda 177 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y24di7dkdb8)

today we'll study his gospel of cinema business before that as usual let us check this month Tom dr. G venom could be rewritten commercial 7 among three and our data boobie green MD Budi da da da and we study the page number for 5-7 Friday June 20 1884 it was dusk Saddam petitioner was sitting in his room observed in contemplation of the Divine Mother now and then he was chanting her name the recalled order a m-- and several other devotees we're with him master Asha is trying that particular picture why because that is the way one should practice spiritual life ceramic is not giving the example through his own life and in the evening time is currently sitting meditating here's the task actually the read one cannot see the things it is not that clear that is the dust time every all nature is becoming quite calm because we are reading the nature our mind is also out of it humming quiet that is the time one should utilize and sit quietly and now it then is the England name this is the picture drawn by master Basha only to give us an example of the cinema Tichenor how one should behave one should practice after a while the evening worship began in the temples other lived the room to see the worship other we know those were studying the gospel of sedan Tichenor we know these people he was a deputy magistrate in those days and she came to finish line the evening time he has come to see that Serrano Krishnan aim the enough conversing in has not gone to see them or attend our thing why he knew the speaking time it's done distantly more beneficial spiritual than going and attending the quality that realization he was having and that is the reason hiddenly Saddam distance talking with him tell me does fara intend to continue his studies he is talking with aim because here it is 1884 1886 Ramakrishna will give up his body so within these two years slowlyslowly he's choosing his flag bearers and he's training them and very interestingly he's consulting with in Master Marshall who's a householder and he will be for the a monastic group by master Marshall because master martial art was very pure only thing that he was married so Saddam Krishna didn't take him but his heart was pure fast secondly he was a teacher his experience about the students and the young people were more the cinema business consulting with him about a young boy Babu Rao who afterwards became Shamim prime Ananda so I noticed the other day I saw a bird on as his goddess with a necklace around her neck and we need omen companions about so ceramic ish now he's explaining about the baccarat so this is the speciality those who are coming to see Ramakrishna I know it for sure the call has come from him otherwise it is impossible to country he when he chooses it gives the call he I understand that something he must have done that's why in any game those of us who have come to these ideology we should understand that something good we must have done in the past that's why it's wrong Krishna's chosen us and he is giving the call we are coming to him don't have any doubt about it you need not to go here and there again and again only one Idol RG the Sahaba busines because that is the most Catholic most broad I touch love and unselfishness that is the main thing of ceramic Asia and here we can understand how he is choosing his disciples his apostles who will continue his ideology afterwards practicing in their own lives and also fabricating an outside eye some power Ava's a goddess with a necklace around her neck with woman companions about her she has received something in a dream that means Parag also has received some wonder in a dream his body is pure only a very little effort with awaken his spiritual consciousness now from this description what do you understand Saddam Titian is the God himself he knows everything in and out of a person he knew when he is going to be spiritually awakened he knew his past he knew his future he knows his present also and in the Vishnu Purana defiled with God who knows everything about the beings past present and future that is God without God and the so casually is talking so casually is doing this as if it is nothing but you see not mean we contemplate how could he say like that so this is the wonderful I shall power on that is a goddess actually so full of love Barbara Marathi was full of love and compassion and service and he was beyond now it'll be nice if Barbara lives with me and he is telling the nature of these attendants of mine is undergoing a change now here you have to understand just previously when we were discussing that pratap pratap Majumdar who came over here as a representative of rather religious sect and he is asking cinema Schnurr revere said are those who live like you making progress in spiritual life giving imagine what progress he himself made but this is the eagle I know everything is because he was speaking English so that ego was there as because he tar is explaining the Vedanta and many youngsters and the young people educated people listening to him just immediately after the deception regime give us that second man so that ego was there that expressed before Sri Ramakrishna who wanted to tell him it is enough for you to all this literature in these and that now this time you must concentrate and try to develop your own spiritual power instead indirectly eases things around Asia sluggish didn't say anything immediately but the next day we find he is giving indirectly the reply to that question that he asked without magenta he is saving the it will be nice if Buddha lives with me the nature of these attendants of mine is undergoing a change law to his always things with spiritual emotion like to Mirage afterwards Tamir awakened gave him a monastic name of Bhutan under his Adam explicable so at Buddha it is also one of the types of ramen at the Buddha you cannot explain so show me be weakened and give this name to this lab to Mars at vu tomandlizzie this is really an unthinkable and one cannot explain about him he was completely unlit averse met Brahma Guinea and that is the reason ambition if you read the life of Strava kitchen and the dining disciples the complete idea about the center growth spiritual area so when the see Ramakrishna he himself was not that we educated and one of this daily disciple this lot tomorrow could not retain any school in he was very poor never mind nothing for that whether it is poor whether this is low bar low caste and how much you gated nothing spiritual growth is a completely different thing and his Linga to his always stains with spiritual emotion he is about to march himself in God not the point he's about to march himself in God against Ramakrishna's that they work there he sure his manifesting you could understand what has happened going to happen to who Wayne this is so clear about him he's going to march himself in God Rahul is getting into such a spiritual mood that he cannot do anything even for you sir this is a love for meditation laughs for taking the name of God this lot to monocytic Almaraz not that they constantly have that this reading the spiritual and discussing now they are serving the Holy Mother serving the MA master ma the our ramakrishna and meditating meditating meditating taking the name of God that way in the presence of Saddam additionally average - they had fight about which slavishly games of bustling within few days he'll march with God this Latimer has a local knowledge etc among the youngsters Barbara and me Ranjan are rather exceptional Neera Neera mirage ass tremendously discover Bharadwaj FM in iran i did but the are special very special body because of the purity we will have this I don't want problem to tear himself away from his family it will make travel at home so he is giving the time when I asked him why didn't you come he says why not make me come Babu knows that confidence he knew the Salama Krishna is not ordinary he is God himself so that it is everything in your hand while you are not calling me so that I can come she loses her call and weaves he says raka is very happy here so the other day when devotee was telling I inspire young people to become mom some of them they have become I told no one can make mom's you know renouncing is not so easy no one can make that it is all inborn and when the time will come that is manifest no one can do that we have seen even the parents they're connected with the Ramakrishna mission they want their son to become among their great respect of the moms and all through from the childhood days they give that education you should become involved you should be like this you should be like that the windlass they have to brought them boil and wanted to offer it to our president sharmaji please accept him as among the Maharajah ask him do you like to become a mom no let the parents do I don't bother it's all in born as a last birth we must have done something so he got the call otherwise it is impossible no one can inspire so this we must understand and who can see this Martha the day we and one boy he was behaving very peculiarly another young man of the same age but the both of them they were in those days days to get down from the Train and there to walk a sometimes those who were having some money could hire some who love cars and all that so they are walking lonely that village roars so this gentleman are for use a hundred young man is going let me talk to him so he was talking to the very interesting it's a wearing ugly and he said where everyone should go that was his reply very clear Hey so I am going to mother's house my destination houses are saying everyone should go there there is a what do you do I'm preparing myself to sacrifice at the feet of mother but look at the sea so he was just different type and one of the way when he saw on the board there are some lotuses he jumped into that so and then plucked some of the flowers came over there and in the same condition who is holding the flowers so that he can offer it to the Holy Mother then finally they reached the second boy never cared for the first one that we have friends do to stay together and another thing ever he was in his own mode then this first one from the Calcutta City he told mother look at that boy mother was a little preseason tip mother commented it is his last body that's why he never bothers about anything they become like this but this boy mother didn't say anything to him was good he was also having the devotion to mother but mother never say but about him mother immediately said it is this last bar so the new oculus is telling like there and the rock are a huge tree with ceramic resna and this our babu Ron Klain is to see him is to feel that he's so happy why Babu Nam even go they were very rich people joined us a part of their ancestral house has come to the Ramakrishna mission and we have a center over there nowadays if you go to Jeremy Atacama cuckoo you can go to that place and bubbles mother was very good lady she used to feed the young boys and all the time helping them and in their house only if you go still that place is there where they took the promise that we will become monks under the leadership of shaman Vivekananda so from that house he's thinking I'm not happy if I could come and steal why because the past birth is constantly constantly asking to come over here you must have to come there's no other way no one can explain why they have come if you ask why they become involved sometimes they try to give answer I read one book of Swami Vivekananda then I got inspired why you so many people are also getting those books how come that if one of us from which he was a Muslim by religion and he was from the matías country he was a doctor and one evening he was travelling in the Germany is to stay in Germany he saw the one gentleman a German gentleman reading the complete works of Shama vivica in the world one and is not the system in the euro to immediately borrow but he was doing he saw that he said this is the man this is the person the picture of Swami Vivekananda and he was drawn as a CEREC you don't mind can I read the few pages of the book he said ok he started reading and he felt this is the book I wanted then is it can I borrow me you come to my house lot of books are there you can take any book slowly started reading and then one day he decided to become a monk he came to bear a lot and you know that because foreigner so and then from other religion a lot of things and afterwards he became a monk still there is there how can explain it is impossible why he suddenly saw that book and why he felt drawn to that particular picture from the Vivekananda and why forgetting all other etiquettes he requested a gentleman to give the book to him is all goes in that witness no one can answer only God knows so we must have to have that great faith once we have come over here we are not going to leave this is a great ideology rock along leaps here as one of the family I know that he believed that again be attached to the world de Calma Raju was married but still cinema Krishnan told he is not going to be attached with the family with the world the attachment the desire the community different the sometimes some people they don't feel attached to the world but they do something else they'll be going and taking the picture and leaving in the jungle or doing research on something very special like these like that they are also not that we are touched but their view is different the goal is different but those only become monks nuns the departments are totally different not much of a philosophical if you ask the person have you read the philosophy and then you have become now they gave this to the some type of attachment to do some but people I do not see of God so they go so here is a dark alone what do you think of me Daniel is very interesting is asking but you think of near and then again he's asking to master Russia in he's very handsome see and immediately is Ramakrishna's answered no I am NOT asking about his looks he is guiding this one can easily realize covered if one is free from God this word Kyle means shuttle the shuttle of Tao what is the subtle the simplicity not that they are idiots not that they don't understand they understand everything but take it simply they will never make it or why he says like this why their dream like that he will never make it complicated maybe very simple that's generated the movement they will understand that someone is going to have the spiritual life then immediately they would go away from the without doing any other things and they feel that this person when they come the company it's not giving the public minute in the mind they won't go there they're very intelligent at the same time simple they're choicelessness telling he himself was shallow embodiment of Sahaba McGrath Saddam kishna but he knew everything he understood everything why a person is here apart from his spiritual the power that he can read the mind of each and every one from the childhood days if you see he's to understand where to go and not to go and to whom to talk to learn not everything since tideless one can easily realize God if one is free from guide spiritual instruction produces quick results in a kindness heart they always say young wine should come in spiritual life in the Ramakrishna mission 25 years that is the bottle and nowadays you must have to have the the college universities certificate and then 25 years and now somebody is doing some research and the doctor of this thing and that ultimately 30 about $13 why don't they do that then one gentleman came he was telling suppose I am above 30 but one day we become the mom not in wrong distribution but anyway where else you can take genius on it the sannyasi or not these technicality whatever if you are not having their aversion or attachment now I don't want this and I want these no not like that just that is a sannyasi what did you become like that is no problem you can but an organisation there some rules and regulations should have to be ended that is the thing sometimes some people don't understand the Rama extermination and why they have not taken this show me sir they were so young and all this thing because of the organization the moment you are coming to the organization the main thing is you have to follow that rules and regulation otherwise the somebody will come and say I need to go out and leave lecturing mixing with the devotees living in their houses but I'd like to be a member of the ramakrishna mission then they said no we have all good wishes for you go and spread the message but not as a member of the rural distribution we are not attached with any political ideologies maybe we are concerned about sustainably all the countries eventually discussed but not having any political associations this is the system of the organization now some people if they think that no why not so so many wrongs they are having these so we should also go it can always go but not as a member of the Rama distribution that is exactly this is the organizational system if you accept you stay if you don't accept you have every right to go out and do whatever you like organizational system is this the today I was talking to someone and I was telling look at Swami Vivekananda who loved India so much but we need form the ramakrishna mission we see mom should not be associated with any political movement and his disciple debated assistant editor she got very much involved with the freedom movement of India our government Indian Movement she was an Irish British but she thought now the first is the freedom Shami himself says ammiji freedom freedom freedom freedom is the first condition of growth so she had no Raja Minaj Johnny brahmananda axed her sister either these of that I tell you be with us or you give up she wrote published in the newspaper announced to the public I have no connection with the nominees Generation Y shielded has to do that work and then all true we had a very good relation even now after hundred years we can say we are celebrating sustainability you know the last year the whole area celebrated sister nivedita enough problem the ten we have to understand as an organization these are the system you must have to follow and here the near engine when you were talking and Iranian will not bad in history why against Mary you know because when Dina see if they are they are entitled with the house of responsibility when you are madding means you are taking the responsibility of a lady or a gentleman so naturally you have to have those duties to perform and this is the reason and Selam piston was chosen picked enough his direct disciples to make a monastic organization so he said no he won't Maggie then he is saying he said master hastily then Salafist instantly what we want gain by renouncing betel leaf and our tobacco better leak and leave and tobacco in the wine he sniffing like that in those days in regard even today if you go to our charm if you go to somebody's house the first thing they will offer you is that better leaf then the cost on the system in those days the regard is particularly who love India and is still part of India days to choose better Lear and these two have particularly the men folk this smoking and tobacco so that was the commotion Tomic on that was the big other ways to say come see and smoke and nowadays we have become very conscious over health so there smoking has gone but in those days these two have the very special and witty varieties different type of double bubble's rich people these two have different ever even in those things if you see the pictures a man is going to attain his office and his servants they are carrying Hubble bubble and one person is holding that and when walking in he is going on smoking holding that good all this some krishna is mentioning these suppose do you think that I give up all this so I renounce that is not the renunciation and what is renunciation lost and gold comma and culture why every time he is making this gamma and Kanchana commons design cannot be fulfilled without the help of money tangina is not literal it is gold but cultural means money so money is necessary to satisfy the desire and again you have to go for something some work some responsible to art the money again for the desire it goes in a circle comma and culture it goes in a circle so he's doing the what will one gain by announcing better livin tobacco the real renunciation is the renunciation of last and gold prince iodine and you can say not that I am a ramakrishna mission monk so the gospel of Salaam o Krishna is our spiritual Ramakrishna mission main scripture all monks and nuns and the devotees do read must read Augusta apart from that if you judge in a practical life also the spiritual growth how cinema distance is giving the advices if you want to really truly spiritual growth these are things parishes and just two years about spiritual life and when you are talking with your friends you can put forward some of that is a different thing if you are going to give the lady church on that there's also different thing but the spiritual life that you try to develop the completely different completely sometimes some people are asking because the Vedanta they are studying they're not mixing up the devotion and the path of knowledge and will choose one if you want to lead a spiritual life in the path of knowledge of course you can go but very difficult you have the responsibilities you have everything how can you go and seanyb we currently is giving a practical end of the Vedanta what is that self confidence and develop the self confidence I can also do there's a practical big anthem and then you having the relationship with the friend relationship we taught because they are also the same eternal be integral names and pawns but when you try to realize that following the pattern the knowledge the drama portion of our drama of yourself that is a totally different thing manova the oncology turning on that constantly to go on which are of each other and each other this is hard ready to to death go ahead but if not then follow as Ramakrishna saved understanding the temperament and condition of the present age he saved Nara the above knowledge combined with devotion we will read to that how Salam o Krishna is taking us to that bit the particular point the world your dream won't injure you either to master martial artists history the work you were tree won't injure you writer what you were doing is good when I am NOT cheating people I am not hurting people to our money so obviously this is good no problem so that is exactly what's ramakrishna stealing master masha is stealing I shall be relieved if someone takes charge of them Salameh Krishna was telling him you have the responsibility because you have a mad person then master Mirza who was constantly thinking to give up the family life I shall be relieved if someone take charge of thing then see remotest instilling that is true but now do these as well as that what is this and that this means the worldly duties that you were treated performing and that means spiritual practices exactly what all of us are doing that this and that many vote to vote they are coming from faraway places and coming and cleaning it we all never knew that they have come they're coming and they're cleaning the whole thing and sweepy and then washing the dishes than doing anything don't you think that they will get the blessings of God of course they should they will each and every action if it is having the result the good work that they're doing and they are not telling anybody and housing anyone they are going to do this are there no never secretly they are coming to you quietly praying to tackle and going away these and that this type of services unselfish services that there is spiritual practice again you are taking the name of God spiritual practice reading the holy book spiritual practice giving some donations charity spiritual practice in spreading people in the difficult times spiritual practice talking very nicely with others spiritual practice considering others spiritual practice what is these what is a responsibility that I am so I am a doctor I am so whatever not doing this and that so this and that Solano Kristen's mentioning and it is so nicely then the master much is telling it is great love to be able to renounce everything Saddam wished that is true but we will act according to their inherent tendencies we have seen how to renouncing they can become all again they become entangled with something and going mainly the Rahman destination the training is very strict and all the time observing you know the in our younger days we were not allowed to go alone all the time two or three will be good if not three - then you have together then you will come and tell about the report and yes as a you went over there like that like that why this because now I was we know us l know only in the world and nobody I was making my or these decisions and I was discipling why now that I have become a monk or a nun I have to have someone with me because of these you know the moment do you think that I have given up immediately all your past that will come some scholars recall impressions and they will separately and sometimes openly force you to do this entire what you have left already so along he was and not bring very gross mistakes and understand I have it I can see we expect all of those things don't go back to take that again use your decision nobody would become wrong when you were a monkey were a monk that should be the pitch once I have left have left why don't I'm not bond with anyone people clapping are praising fondly don't bother about that damn internet it data they are whatever comes in drawn as a responsibility performance as best as possible don't bother about anything so I was telling him because he was my young and I mean under me then it was my responsibility to table so I guided him I don't read it the chin D in every day you descending you get the strong and all this attractions and everything why he can't because the Maya and who is the goddess of Maya wizard Gaga Saratov region D and so she will be pleased all this thing will go is leading now a very good life so these are the things we learn from gospel absolutely and this is very very practical book in spiritual life that is true but people act according to the opinion you have a few more is to perform now ceramic is now is giving the ashes to mastermind shape not just an ordinary experiences because if you could see him so he's if you do two more industries are over you are you happy put the goal of light peace cinema so that create assurance a little bit of duties then after that peace is waiting for me I will get it the realization had surely come then you'll be released a man cannot easily get out the Ezzor is owned the speciality the moment you will say something immediately one example it will give here is given the example a man cannot easily get out of the hospital once his name is the destructive he is discharged only when he is completely cured I know a gentleman who was in the hospital at the time of going he hews subside and go in a mental hospital he talked to the doctor not there then afterwards he was not liking after two three days it will doctor elect to go no coming is your a going is of a decision he did not you cannot take the decision that you make oh we won't so as I remember the Turkish word when you go to hospital you are going in your decision but understand deliver cure doctors aloud go so like that in this world we have come and we have to wait for the grace of God the devotee you come here mainly divided into two rows now listen to this and we have to analyze in which blue week first loop one group the same Oh God give me liberation this is one group another belong to the inner circles does not talk that way they are satisfied if they can know two things first who I am second who they are and what their relationship to me is then he is telling to master Merced you belong to the second group otherwise then dr. Turk he's not mentioning Ramakrishna is not mentioning him maybe he mentioned but master master did not record it if we loved what is this I don't care whether going to get the liberation unknown I am very happy oh god that you have brought me over here and I like to son be willing to know you there is a recording song composed by one of our Swamiji he was static discipline of mother amar you now to mark a lie he is mentioning of quoting from the material amar you now please include me to mark a lie in your play oh my god I read the rhyme is this childhood days the name was gerado that I finally request you allow at your hand and hold your feet please accept me then whatever you do in that amar you now tomorrow right oh my god I hate to redeploy so that is the inner circle they don't bother about note the shaman be returned again and again he's his way of his talking me inspired enough he said it so many times you have lived and you didn't get the liberation the proof is that you are living now and supposing this life also you give it at the feet of God and serving him what is their liberation are no liberation I am very happy that I am otaku how it is possible because he loved you I want to be with him the company of that person whom I loved that is cinema kissed instilling that this inner group then he is doing please tell me one thing what is the significance of my having heart my arm the sadhana Krishna broke his arm and he is telling why what is the significance a miss eyelid he didn't give any because it could not get any good to us for a reply then the master himself is tearing my arm was broken in order to destroy my ego though I'm a great soul and I can talk to God so that he go the slang business man like he is telling anything may happen anytime is not this junk mr. was not having any ego the things that we are having but he is stealing don't think that as because you were a spiritual person religious person guitar Bob guru so nothing will happen to you anything Mammon and sadhana business stealing to destroy my ego Carradine says I hadn't acquired any other powers because I eat fish captain means that he was the representative of the Nepal King in the in the day he came to because the British was different in the nipple Kingdom was different the anonymity is like today that ambassador they go and stay here to have all this businesses and so captain was the representative of navarre he was a big man in those days even those people the other thing eating fish and meat oh my god in the stone no religion religion is only about eating even today many many people everywhere they don't understand anything telling the truth oh no don't bother about that we this community we have to tell that how this falsehood that is okay it can go with but about religion don't take leader fish with the earlier Naga once in our Krishna this B is four five nine in the Gospel he very clearly is mentioning captain says I haven't occurred in yonkers slumped is now just now he was telling the future and the past and the presenter everyone and if this is not occurred power then what is the occult power and because I eat fish I tremble with fear now set our distance reaction I tremble with fear least I should act where those powers if I should have them then this place would return into a hospital or a dispensary everyone will come touch me I'm having great pain in the knee all these and that please and that will become hospital thus in a person's expression that that is good occult power is nothing to the ritual life and those who are really pure they want to get the spiritual experience they don't want that in is the ring no sir you have seen to us that the man cannot rely his God if he's possesses even one of the eight occurred brothers nada the austere the shakti the eight occurred powers of the earth you can become very small you can become very big you can go to anywhere you can listen to anything from the distance all the solar powers majority of the people did practice spirituality only to record those but that is also very difficult not that very easily we'll get that but if you get him even one of them you are not going to get the realization God again see Ramakrishna is sitting there for love without any selfish motive is best love without any selfish motive best then what is the spiritual life acquiring love without any selfish motive and what will be the reaction of that practice unselfishness that's why Shami become the same unselfishness is God the definition of God unselfishness is God the moment you are purely unselfish you have nothing but love love for each and every one God wheat fall and formless god are both equally true the friends we must mark this what do you see he's asking to the master worship one cannot keep one's mind on the floor bless God a long time that is why God as uniform for his devotees it meaning again one cannot keep one's mind on the formless God for a long time that is why God as useful for his devotees Brahman Arabic Allah Allah the drama brahmana is not a uniform but Roop Okolona we are beginning that same things for white because it will be easy for us to attain that today morning I was discussing the gentleman he's having the confusion then I was telling him as long as you are having the high consciousness you have to practice meditation with father and winds slowly slowly that will match you you need not to bother about effort it will automatically become the formless meditation when I is not there then you also is not there when as long as I am meditating and I am meditating on the formless August is possible I am meditating on my god my god I and Mark my god I am meditating slowly slowly becomes completely match here the God and the person who was meditating become one there remains no difference justice white ceramic is mystery those were the forward substitution I don't know why unnecessarily we are having this type of problems if you read the gospel at least two pages every day you can complete the whole book and you will have the power instruction about the sweeter life and then that he is telling like this captain makes a nice remark in this connection she says that with a bar gets tired suing very high he purchased up on a tree and rest so the mind is going out then sometimes coming down and taking the rest I saw in a vision that the houses of other Barragan shouldn't were so many places for our gathering cinema Krishna he saw these are the devotees will help in forming the organization so this is the unit organized combination of the monks the monastics and also the householders why because Saddam Oh business started these in this way so the householders are coming helping the mount to start this organization or the ministry or the societies or and slowly slowly both they are going to simple so this way cinema Krishna the helpers Linda Balarama and Allah reach and when established people and along with all these youngster detectives to come the neighborhood distributing and gave them the money and this young people who became moms physically they wait out the spreading the psychology I think of the musician and his magic Vedanta magician and the magic the God is creating this universe God is a magician and this universe is this magic today morning and the TV I was observing an American musician the first organized he was playing with the children he was giving them the candies and that you the child didn't recover it later another thing so with the empty glass she recovered that sweet now open she opened in this LOM magician was sitting over there and this church started crying when it is gone then again is a lot you know it is already there again so like this magician is true magic is false how he does it is different thing now afterwards let us complete this again he sees everything advanced God Maya and the universe and living beings universe and living beings God bhaiyya University living things that these three things and that is why it's called triple-t Vader and Trinamool of the Ferrari all those things actually 340 beta from there all those names have come but some stories distant forces three putting a on dieta and Guillen in the beginning here all different at the end they become one so that is slowly so he sees that the pita Maya Evita Maya universe and all living beings exist and at the same time do not exist exist and at the same time who do not exist as long as you are thinking I am observing their existing when there is no I the smaller generate the small idea it is there when they're small is absent it is not there and then shuttle Vinci Tata and all that I think we should conclude over here we will continue in the next class gone gumbo [Music] tritter be crowned by he shall but Adam but a me a medium Tom she does indeed Chandi hurry you touch said sorry Donna but I was too
