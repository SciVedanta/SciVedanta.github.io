[238: Panchama Veda 238 : Sri Ramakrishna And Chariot Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtPPWKkN5yI)

dear friends devotees so today instead of reading from the Gospel of ceramic Krishna and explaining will of course read a little but we will try to understand the significance of the great chariot festival ratha-yatra the hindus they go mad when the authority returned at rockem's and of course this this year particularly because a very peculiar situation the kovat 19 situation all over the world say they could not enjoy but still there a theatre but what is this ratha-yatra and then we are interested to know why slam Oh Krishna was so much interested in the data particularly Puri Jagannath Jagan not the name of that is the jagat Jagan not the he's the Lord of the universe Jarett means universe and not means the lord the not lord of the universe there's a lot many stories at the air many of mostly you know but let us do it and start with this mantra which is dedicated to the supreme lord Jasha smaranam our trainer Genma samsara bandha not be mud Chitina mustache my machine away proverb is Navi Vishnu I bow down to that great Supreme Being remembering him even for once one get liberation from the circle of birth and death janma samsara bandha not from the bondage of birth and death just remembering once that is called Vishnu the word Vishnu is a great significance the Mishnah means that which is all-pervading so the that is exactly what the Hindus always go on telling though there are so many varieties of gods and goddesses there will be worshipping but at the same time they will go back to Vishnu form what is that Vishnu form all pervading again because we cannot conceive that all-pervading consciousness there is nothing and I am only that consciousness merged in that supreme consciousness is very difficult so they have given the form different form Vishnu is also having that form it was Tuesday July 14 1885 the car festival at Balarama house master Masha is mentioning it was the day of the car festival Sri Ramakrishna left his bed very early in the morning he was alone in the room dancing and chanting in the name of God all alone is so joyful he is dancing and chanting the name of God why car festival Lata yatra and in entered and saluted the master other devotees arrived one by one they saluted the master and took seats near him Salameh Krishna was longing intently for Pune she was talking to him about him put her as a young boy see Rama Krishna knew that he was very very pure so he wanted to talk to him and then afterwards they all came to the balarama's house it was in Popper Calcutta as a and now it is called North Calcutta at the buzzer area Balarama would that particular house was the Ramakrishna's to visit the family of the Balaram bush they were the landlord they have given it to donated it to ramakrishna mission now it has become an astronaut the ramakrishna and the same building is there and same veranda is also their corridor and even the chariot the small wooden chariot the that's the ramakrishna pool still it is there and every year the devotees will go monks will go and all they will go and they will slowly drag it and sing bhajans and as a spiritual follower see Ramakrishna it was afternoon in the meantime the small car of juggernaut decorated with flowers flags and burn and burn bunting had been brought to the inner veranda the images of juggernaut and Subhadra Balarama so you have noticed those who have seen that picture that Jagannath is black and Subhadra is white and his Balarama is yellow so one gentleman he gave ten picture and said when you see the in the you know nowadays because of the color there are lot of differences are coming and all through it is there in the human society they will always go on fighting with something or other so it is in the color the black color and then white color and the yellow color one gentleman gave the picture of Jagannath and subhadra a Balarama there Subhadra is the sister and Balarama is the brother Jagannath the two brothers and the sisters sister in the middle so he's he wrote when you see different color and I find juggernaut this abuse that so the Jagan Subhadra and Balarama were adorned with sandal paste flower garlands robes and jewelry's sri ramakrishna lived the room where the professional musicians were singing and came to the veranda accompanied by the devotees he stood in front of the car and pulled it by the rope he began to sing and dance with the devotees in front of the car behold two brothers have come who weep while chanting his name the one of our young Swami he sings it particularly kitten there very nicely I like it very much because Tokuda loved this song and when he sings very nice this is a Christian song those were hard you know so this is the juggernaut there's a Lord now mind renaud Gupta the recorder of the kilometer he has written in his memoirs that ceramic is to is to inspire the devotees to visit the Puri Puri is in central India it is an Orisha state and to visit that temple is a huge temple beautifully built and on the bank of the the sea the great ocean the sea so that is the ceramic which needs to say you must go and visit the juggernaut not only that he asked him you must go and embrace the juggernaut statue moorthi master ma cherie he was very hesitant what to do cinema Krishna asked and I must do and now how to do because the the people who are worshipping over there we you know the pandas they're known as the pandas so they will never allow you to touch that the you can go you can offer your pranaam and then you to go away the like that the small that succumbed that you have to go around the temple that is also there then what to do what to do then suddenly he made one thing God has asked me to do it I must do it who is God's forgiving Salaam Krishna so in through some coins on the floor and those pandas those where the the worshipper were there the puja is so they got attracted to those things and immediately they all went down over there on the floor and picking up the coins in the meantime there was no one he went and embrace Jagannath and quickly went and mixed with the other people the devotees so no one could notice him and he could come back he came and told see Ramakrishna I had to do like this what to do sadhana Krishna was very happy you have embraced Jagannath then he embraced three more and said now I have embraced the juggernaut as because you have seen Jagannath I have also so this is jagannatha and sri ramakrishna was very fond of it another sadhana crystals to say that he cannot visit Puri why the aim has written the Sadam occasion is to frequently say I cannot visit Puri because the moment they go over there I will die my soul will merged with the jagannatha so what does it mean it means that see Ramakrishna the avatar a barrister he is also the Vishnu who is this Jagannath Lord Vishnu himself we find in the bhagavata that the they were talking about the Vishnu Vishnu is all-pervading but sometimes he is taking different forms that in the sanaka brothers he came in the form of a great Swan and when they asked kebab on who are you he answered no me as Bishnu the sickish 'no when say to Dava inaudible get away fine I taught Brahma the first part the devotion like Arjuna in the bhagavad-gita where he said that I taught this yoga to so-and-so or Juno doubted how it is possible he was so young you are at my time but then here also the same Krishna he showed the vichy Rupa the whole mission is the whole universe is just sustaining in our on him so he is Vishnu the Krishna showed it the same way here also he told you dhaba about the story of the Swan and the son brothers sanaka sananda sanatana sonnet kumar the four brothers so they wanted to know the technique of of yoga and the the he David the sons of brahma and they requested the pray to the Supreme Being and Supreme Being came in the form of it so on so in different form he can come and in the traditional Hindus they believe again and again to save his own creation the Lord he came and Lord Vishnu the all-pervading consciousness he came in different poems and that we know at the SHA Bottari the Shabbat are in different forms he came see three more as mentioned Bob and see Rama Krishna himself told many times I am the jagannatha puri the Krishna is showing to Arjuna and also to who'd ever that he is Vishnu of course the Rama we know he was also the Vishnu the part of Vishnu see oh no krishna himself is telling I am that juggernaut of the pootie so why he used to be so happy on that particular day it was yesterday I think over here the juggernaut that ratha Yatra because that is the Jay the whole year juggernaut will be sitting in the temple and all people are coming and worshiping that is one unlike the human being they like to go for outing and he at that day at that particular time juggernaut he also wants to go out and where he will go in the relatives house there's a mother sister in that house he will go and the people will they pull that they could go and use the horses but no people like to carry they their Lord so that is called Jagan and that time has been he is going out with his sister and brothers he was being very happy the Salonika schnur's happiness depicted that particular dad day Jagan that jagannatha is very happy we know that story that when the Krishna in the last time he was sitting on a branch of a tree and he had a beautiful the the below of that feet his it was reddish very red type and a hunter from the distance couldn't understand that it is a human feet he thought the two birds the Red Birds he wanted to hunt it so he shot the arrow and that arrow killed Krishna of course of in the hunter understood it he came and profusely he begged pardon the Krishna blessed him and told I was waiting for you I was waiting that he will come and everything that I have made all these now saint the news of my debt to Arjuna and when the Arjuna came to know about it he came rushing over there then according to the hindu system he honor he made the pyre only many people are there and then krishna's holy body was put into fire as is the tradition after the body is burnt they collect the bones and that they take it and the ashes and take it to the river sir or do you now wanted to find that he couldn't find anything over there everything became ashes except the novel so that he collected then he heard the voice that you must throw it in the ocean don't keep it with you Arjuna did that that never started floating this the hunter he noticed it and he started following that day is up to date month after month he was following the movement of that it is floating is not going down in the water and floating and from there and from the western coast of India it came to the eastern coast in Orissa and it came near the coast and the hunter went and took it then he heard the divine voice and you and your dis descendents who worship Me and when the time will come give it in the hands of some other people so he took it inside the jungle and started worshipping that in the meantime the people are wondering where it has gone some naturally you cannot close out the whole information so people were going on gossiping about this something they must have got these hunters and they are so happy and they are so contended so obviously there's something must be there didn't king of the Orisha also came to know about it and he's saying the brahmana young boy to know about it is it that true that it is the navel of the Krishna and it seems that he also got the divine instruction that you should collect it and make a beautiful temple and put me over there to worship so this all going on whether you believe it or not story goes in this way that one brahmana boy went inside the jungle and then he was there he married the girl of the leader of the hunters and he noticed that his father-in-law he goes in a particular in the early morning after bathing and with the washed clothes wearing he goes somewhere without taking anyone then one day he told his wife I like to go over there and naturally wife the daughter of that leader she went on crying to her father you must take your son-in-law over there then ultimately he agreed the son-in-law was the brahmana boy who married that the hunters daughter and okay but one condition his eyes should be enclosed then only we can take him he should not know where we are going so they tired his eyes and he was a body he was a very clever boy what he did he took some seeds secretly in both the hands and all through he went on during those seeds very quickly grown that seed he took and then reached over there inside the jungle and in a small heart very nicely kept he knew it then afterwards when he came back in the same way the blindfolded he came back but he knew that it was sprout and when the rain came you went over there secretly followed that took that and we back to the king these people they were very sorry but the heart the divine boys told them no tis time that I should be there in the temple to be worshipped and in the meantime the king was very happy to find that the letter Alex the divine relics of the prishtina the he heard a voice that told the one big log will come floating in the ocean collected and make a divine but statue and put this inside that so that was brought but no carpenter could touch that wood it was so hard like the stone no one could do anything on that no carving was impossible so the king started praying to the God then suddenly one day one old man came and he was the Lord Himself the wish acaba himself and he came and told in the form of the old man hitter I can do it but till I come out of the room no one should go in so that is the story he went on working on that with his own rules and he could carve it cut it and he was making people from outside could hear those sounds the queen of that country she was very curious she was thinking what this old man is doing inside this room for Mons together is he actually cheating or doing something wrong over there so we doubt the hick she could not control our curiosity so she went and told the King King got also influenced by her words and and open the door and they found now the present Jagannatha that we doubt hands without the feet and without the eyelids there is the form that we see it is over there because the condition was if you open the door without my permission so that I will vanish I will go away so that the juggernaut that you worship over here this is the story and the beautiful story and we must believe it because it is possible everything is possible in the realm of the God and his Maya so this is the story it goes in this way and that this is also we find that this juggernaut is known as daaru Rama what is this darude Rama the Daru means the OOD wouldn't that wooden and Brahma means all-pervading consciousness like the Sun brothers sonic and brothers the Supreme Being came in the form of a swan and here in the modern age he has come in the form of a wood every 12 years they changed the wood and that is called naba calibra Calavera means the body never means the new it's a new caliber every year the special people are there so they will go they will find out one wood inside the jungle it is mainly maintained by the king now the present government so there they will find and from the from the below up to the 12 feet there should not be any branches and straight it is going up and that exactly on the 12 feet they will cut it and bring and then make again this second form art form like that Nabokov and they would make a hole and there they will keep the relic of the Krishna that is called Baloo Brahma jagannatha so many stories are there about it and if you go and see how the food they are cooking that is a wonderful thing to see inside the temple and temple is so big and for a long long time standing over there and in a different Hindu sects they go and worship the Jagan the same jagganath in the same temple anyone can enter every anyone can go because is the juggernaut only they were afraid of the foreigners because the foreigners when they went to India I'm talking about the invasions they went on defaming all the temples and the images this to go and break the noses of the images they'll defame that break to all those this other Hindus were afraid and from perhaps I I think as tradition has come down that the foreigner should not be allowed inside that may be the reason nowadays should change I think the people will trust lowly understand this so this is the reason they are not allowed but all different six of the Hindus they go and in the Jagannath temple there is no the classifications of the rich or poor educated uneducated now everyone should go equally all the go and they should worship that and then ultimately when they are coming out they go to a place is called Ananda Bazar Ananda means the joy and barger means a place where things are available in meaning so that is called the market place the market of joy you can say Ananda Barger what did do defeat people anyone can go and purchase the are that there will be some sometimes the temple Authority feeding the people reach poor forgetting about their caste systems and their social status all they will sit together and they will eat that is called Ananda Bahji idea is before the God everyone are same that is jagannatha the second century BC even the join religion started the worshipping the jagannatha visiting the jagannatha temple it says the in the patronage of the king Karbala the Jain religion is became very popular over there and the joins also started visiting in the second century BC but this also is to go and see that and the German not is what she tried different Hindu sects there is a gene asana when he is on the gene asana the Buddhist will worship him when he's on the Rutan Abady beta means the accumulation of thing and that is with the all jewelry's with their all costly jewels that is called Ratna be divine juggernaut is sitting on that his jagannatha is the lord of the universe and when he's going for bathing and he sits on that and people will be pouring water and breeding him as the Kings used to have that that time is Ganapati why there's a story the one great devotee of the Ganapati means the Ganesha so one great devotee of the Ganesha he came to visit and when he came to visit he was praying oh Lord you should manifest yourself as my lab has my Ganapati as my Ganesha but he couldn't find that then he became very angry he told you were not Jagannath you are not the Brahmin otherwise you could fulfill my desire why you are not fulfilling my desire so from then onwards and again the he found his own the deity the Lord Ganesha in that jagannatha so from their Ganapati in the new form nabo calibra he is worshipped as Sheba when the form is changing that time is Shiva and when he's in chariot he is the studio he is the son and really it is wonderful the German that is worshipped as Dakshina Kali and at that time when the juggernaut is worshipped as the Dakshina Kali they will put all the jewelry's as the women they were in India and they will put the shoddy the the special cloth the Indian women they wear the shoddy on juggernaut so juggernaut is the combination of all gods and goddesses the combination of all faiths and that is why he is jagannatha they will be worshipping the be mala breathable Yantra jagannatha stupid over the be mala is that that is the power of the white up at the God and juggernaut is the weight of juggernaut is the Shiva the Shiva Kali that concept of the tantrikas they find over there friends you know this juggernaut is not having any the league's and also we can see the feet and also the hands the palms is not happy and what does it mean that is the uniqueness in the conception of the Hindus the the Hindus they are having so many varieties of statues so many varieties of images they worship in the picture but these are all symbol the symbol of the great idea of the brahman the Burman the one the all-pervading consciousness and that is manifested in different form in the beginning we were discussing about this so this is called the same way a juggernaut alsa we heard the story that is unfinished statue so obviously like this but in reality there's a in the sense in the Punisher disease but a jetty tenuity the duty that antiquey that intereste USERRA versa to do service jasja by hih taaha but it is not he or she is the consciousness so no gender and it is here it is there it is inside it is outside it is everywhere saturated and that is the reason the Lord doesn't need the feet to go anywhere he is already present this is the symbol he is not having the feed because is not necessary he is already present where he will go and in the hands also the same way what he's going to do with the hands because the moment he is thinking everything is done so that is the end you know that sometimes I have already said in some of my talks that the great worshipper of sri ramachandra you can understand is a personal God Sri Ramachandra and he worshiped him as he is divine other another goal but when it is said like this the Tulsa dosti the Tulsi das ji invited divine different gods and goddesses and he wanted to feed them he kept a seat for all gods and goddesses except for Sri Ramachandra he's on the personal guard when the Ramachandra appeared in he found that all seats are reserved for all gods and goddesses and he is not having any place to see as if he went and axed his devotee so where I will seat where is my place and in a beautiful in a couplet that devotee that Goswami Tulsidas ji he said puch of whom my inky Rahu kaha my pooja tasuku ciao Johana ho ho the hoo-dee-hoo clean tomorrow a town a town I heard it from one of our great Swami Atman and the G I was a prematurely that time in our day custom and he's to come and sing he was a master in reading that ramcharitmanas there's a Ramayana written by that question me Tulsi das ji in the whole of Middle India mid India that is and in the northern part of India is very popular almost all they'll be chanting and quoting from this book I heard him singing and I learnt it from him the tune poocho Huma he Kyra Homolka ha my poo chatter Saku ciao Johanna ho ho toh who they hookah he to mahi breakaway Tao oh lordy were asking me where he will saved now tell me where you are not is there any place where you are not already so where I will spread your asana where I will keep your seat every place so that shows the beauty of the Hinduism in the sanatana-dharma you'll find that very crude type of worship they'll be worshipping the cows they were speaking the trees worshiping the river worshiping the Sun the Moon and then worshiping the stone everything they'll be worshiping but ultimately they go to this truth the from the duality reduced to the ultimate non well form you were everywhere oh my god you were everywhere so that is what they always say that in the ratha-yatra we find in the Upanishad also we find the cattle Punisher very beautifully it's mentioning Hasina Durham Durham bridgetta shayana jati sorry bata are seen sitting while sitting it travels far Hasina Durham bridgetta magic means travel where Durham for how sitting don't think I am sitting you are sitting in a car and driving no not like that not like that in a station in one place but everywhere you are shayana artists are bata though he's sleeping lying down but present everywhere Prince the next Sunday perhaps we will be discussing about the spiritual power that a devotee connect where we will find to those power it is possible yogi capacity and the God of course they can have in the life of Bhagwan see Ramakrishna we are having so many than those same incidents the ceramic isne was in Calcutta and his nephew was worshipping Goddess Durga and requested him to be present over there in those days from Calcutta to reach to that place in Khmer Paco it was really very hard so obviously saddam krishna in person couldn't go but when his nephew was crying and complaining to him or you said that he will come but you have not come he suddenly saw the salam o krishna is standing by the side of that goddess image Dugas image he saw it and it is possible and another person also saw him traveling to Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh he went over there so like this it is possible in his life Ramakrishna's life we see that so cyano yachty sorry but aha that is jagannatha and jaren that goes in the chariot and the three brother and sister in three different chariot it will be and then the jarana the chariot is the biggest one and people will be pulling but what is this chariot in the katha pollitt yourself again and very nicely it mentioned in two verses is the the chapter the one three and three that these the words he says atmanam routine am bt and this is the bid anta we were discussing about the chariot festival and in the chariot festival there are so many varieties of food will be there and the people will be in their best attire and they'll be dancing singing and so many things they will do and in the present days nowadays as because of the ISKCON Eastern International Krishna consciousness the Europeans and Americans they have also learned the beautiful singing and they learn the dances also in hundreds they'll be singing all over in different countries in all of the world we have seen their beautiful they will do and the curtain is a very melodious and one thing that I forgot to mention that the king of that state nowadays there is no king just the title is there but in those days in the olden days when the king was the supreme the power they used to come and to clean the road where the chariot will go with that the broom so days to sweep like that so that is the humbleness so how to reach to God to become humble and who is this God now we will go to the Upanishad to understand the truth behind it at Mauna mati number t-shir Edom rat amoeba to wood team to shouting with the mana Praga ami bacha indriyani iron Naju michigan state you go cheer on our tingly omona öktem bucked at the human engine ah the this body is the chariot so that is the chariot that we made with the wood and all is the body is the chariot and he will wonder how many bones that we are having that many the wooden frames are there in the chariot the same that is the way the same so this is body is the chariot and who is the actual the person in the in the chariot is a car who is the person who is sitting over there Atmaram he is the Rati that self is the master of the chariot he is sitting over there who is jagannatha the self the jagannatha is that Artman he is sitting over there and the chariot is this body and the intellect is the charioteer and the mind is verily the bridle is holding the horses and what are those horses indriyani we are having the five indriyas this five andreas are the the horses iron ah who be Cheyenne's the issue Gocha Ron I had to like to go they'd like to go to all the objects so you have to control admin Bremen Oh yuck tur rock testimony sheen aha and the discriminative people call that sell the enjoyer when it is associated with the body organs and the mind friends this is called the chariot then you have you noticed how the Hindus are slowly taking from a gross external thing to the certain list form how it goes that this body becomes the chariot so that is the reason we should not deny this body sometimes some people are necessarily they try to destroy this body no one should not the tremendous austerity they will be doing in the beginning of his spiritual journey the Siddhartha who became Buddha afterwards he was tortured in his body he won't eat anything you won't drink but sorry damadam kalutara mossad Onam the one group of the International yoga group they wanted to speak I started with this Sharia madam Callooh Dharma siddhanam Shami Vivekananda he is said that all monks should minimum one hour do physical exercise they will go to our any center you can go particularly if you go to valu-mart you'll find even there when you old monks there walking you have to keep the body healthy then afterwards whatever the body is going to die what to do here is the combination of five things it is going to die so don't be afraid of that but as long as we are living we should try to live healthy why because so you can concentrate your mind utilize your mind utilize your energy for to know the truth for God realization it is said in this way the sharira rat amoeba - but the best thing is ourselves and what is the self indeed the body being the students of the Vedanta you all know now that it is the reflection of the supreme consciousness on our intellect it's not the original thing that is there hidden over here but it is the reflection so we should not take it so seriously but only thing that we should know that these if it becomes only the reflection and with that reflection I can I can do so many things why not go back to the original the goal of the spirituality goal of all religion only to take back the human mind towards the original and what is that original jaganatha that is the jagannatha and you have to go back to jagannatha you can go through the path of knowledge you can go through the path of devotion also the beautiful stories are there I heard from one of our monk who was there in the Puri that one old lady she was she wanted to come and she was so poor she could not be for the transport money so she started walking and she was very elderly above eighty and sick also but a great devotee of jagannatha she wanted to go and see that rata the chariot and her Lord he's going in that is the devotees desire she started walking and her villager slowly told see you were very slow we cannot reach over there until we go little fast so you please come because they knew that he/she won't be able to make it she won't be able to reach over there they all walked fast and left her she was walking working then ultimately she became so weak she started quarreling on the road and then in one place she slept when she got up one person came and told my lady where you like to go I like to go to see the Puri but this is the day and still we were nearly six miles away do you think you'll be able to make it she told no I must go and my juggernaut cannot go without seeing me I'll surely go she was she got her again and started walking on on for the two knees and two hands because she was so weak she could not stand now the Puri data everything was ready all the people they wanted to start the rasa and when they started pooling they could not move why it is so heavy they checked it everything is all right thousands of people pulling it is not moving then they brought the elephant to pull it nothing could be done what has happened then the main Poojari the main priest started praying with the tears in eyes there Oh Lord what is our fault why you were not moving what we have done then when he was praying suddenly he saw in his vision the Lord is telling I cannot leave my devotee who is trying to come unless she comes and touches the robe I won't move here then although every corner they they started sending people and the Poojari himself also went out to search and then he went to this person he went to that person ultimately she reached over there that lady was quarreling on four then she told my lady you like to go to Puri only yes and do you think you'll be able to make it because I'm sure that because I am feeling within my heart my lord will wait for me then the person that the main priest started crying and shouting here is the great devotee said they lifted her and took her on a plane Queen and we took over there and the moment she went over there she could not see that great image of the juggernut because she was crying profusely but the moment she touched the road the chariot started moving so these are stories one can believe one can one cannot believe but many miracles may happen in the realm of God so friends this is called jagannatha this is the rata yatra I will conclude from an incident that has been recorded in the ramakrishna putti this another book has the gospel that is a booty and very another political way it has been recorded the deer the Gopal ma those who were the students of the Ramakrishna do you all know about this pious lady the she was married and a very young age of six and then lost her husband she didn't meet her husband at all but in those days that was the system and then people say that you are a widow you cannot marry game then what shall I do you better worship Krishna she started worshipping Krishna and with a desire that I should become the mother of Krishna as bacha bazi ramakrishna again and again said that you should take one idea and you should grow into that idea I am the mother of God and that baby Krishna should come and play on my lap I should feed Krishna the motherly affection and she grew old and old and afterwards when she was almost sixty then she saw sri ramakrishna and then ceramic ISNA when ate something from her hand she cooked something Sadam Krishna was very happy that particular day she got the vision not only visions she played with the Krishna and whole life the tapasya austerity was fulfilled her prayer was answered but that is a Gopala he's she saw and when she brought the Gopala to Sri Ramakrishna Gopala got down from a lab ran and merged in the person above all see Ramakrishna so from that day she started considering ceramic as the Gopala and this is the duality then at the last age see saw see Ramakrishna in a chariot and that see Ramakrishna is star chariot see Ramakrishna is the God who is sitting inside the chariot see Ramakrishna are the horses Sri Ramakrishna is the will see Ramakrishna who is pulling and moving the chariot age and everything nothing but the sea Ramakrishna from the duality shear is to ultimate the monism the oneness the one conscious being is everywhere this is the beauty of the sanatana-dharma from many slowly it will guide you and he will grow into that knowledge of oneness and the chariot reminds us of that Thank You friends thank you for this discussion that you allowed to give me and let us conclude by praying our pranaam to Raghavan see Ramakrishna need Ingenium on entire oom-pah-pah new compa Drita Bikram by Aisha but Adam para Misha medium-term Ramakrishna sheer asana mama Oh Sean the shanti shanti hurry he own that said three dharma krishna are upon of us to own peace peace peace unto all
