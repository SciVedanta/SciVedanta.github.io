[208: Panchama Veda 208: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna - Topic : God and Guru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTxOtWPoiuo)

let us begin today in Hindu tradition religion into spiritualism there are three steps three category 1 Isha the disciple guru the teacher and God the goal so the god guru and sheesha these are the three steps in Hindu spirituality today we'll be discussing about the God and the Guru and also about the shisha who is going to transform into the Guru ship that is the from the discipleship to the guruship our understanding the reality let us begin with this prayer to Raghavan Sadam Krishna the first page that you have god please repeat after me starve accustomed to the Demong so do pakka all Geordi unarmed mehar cheerio krishna namaha ramakrishna earthy namaha do you find in the Hindu tradition the only multiple the moon life in the night and day that is dedicated for so some spiritual and also dedicated for many other spiritual thing why because that was the great time for those people in the dark night it is not possible to do anything so the mana midnight days to enjoy others to dedicate as Nava days we do it Father's Day Mother's Day and this date a different type we dedicated similarly things to dedicate and this was dedicated in the name of Veda Vyasa the bigger Piazza who are instaweather as you know in the history the Builder the knowledge the research was going on in different parts of India and all the knowledge is that was during that school different urban schools in different parts they were not sharing exchanging but the Veda Mercer King beshal would take that is the the qualification they mentioned are chipped if the given wish all day is a very intelligent person he then sent his disciples to collect all the information brought it together and made the for Veda Veda Vyasa organized errands the Vida vida means the knowledge and that also in a very beautiful way and then he understood that this knowledge the subtlety of it the bather is containing two types of knowledge the knowledge of the worldly things and knowledge of the spirituality and that do it was expressed in a very certain way the ordinary people they won't be able to understand so he wrote other things also like the Mahabharata etc so this made a br so he did a lot to remove the ignorance spiritual ignorance we can say from the human being so this particular the Poornima the full moon night is dedicated to better Vyasa the Guru Poornima now we are chanting province around ISNA you see guru regard that is the question we will come to that afterwards now we find that about the God who is God and usually in India there are always Vedanta then they'll be the purana and also the country in the Vedanta what is the God the Maya who poeta Chaitanya the pure with Anthony who is God via Twitter Chaitanya the consciousness reflected on Maya so that is God issue and the yoga Shasta this is the definition of the Isha cliche karma b-baka are Shia Aperol mr. faroush appreciation is shalt not when the vedanta says is a maya who for hit eject and it is hidden a girl another name that means the total power comes to him to create before that the god is having that power but the moment that activity comes the god disassociate with it he's creating the power and that power is mine and mine is having three qualities of Terrigen Tama and this earth garage and kama permutation and combination different from succumbing good medium and the lowest low T so this Sartaj otama they are creating so the maya mijita child under my i do not be able to do consciousness is necessary the reflection of the consciousness and that was sufficient and then in the Jeeva Jeeva among the of all jeevers are saying but among the jeevers the human being honk ara opt Eternia a honker individual Maya the individual Maya that is Ankara who could eat a Jatin again the reflected now the Jeeva is trying to go to God who is that God Maya who put the children and he satisfied with that No so the Hinduism takes one more step it becomes a children itself so to reach to the Chitina first we have to accept our condition we are she's learning understanding then trying then the second trait comes one who has already realized that guru in the Shankara Archer the third chapter 37 verse in bhagavad-gita he says we share system of dressing Bishop Yasha Sri Gianna buried octave yes she ever sure London if she ever shrunken a brother he gonna shun naam and a six type of qualities Shankar Acharya is mentioning he's a dancer body but still he is bringing it down and we sure your system in cluster make sure you means different type of spiritual power so that is completion and the the power that is a billion you know the someone else telling that I have decided so I am going to do it what is this video this video is also necessary the tremendous mental strength sometimes a very good person particularly after coming over here in America I found very intelligent boy very good person are not getting a job can imagine is the best person but even them is not getting a job how tremendous mental power this necessary to survive is an ordinary person even they're not getting anything and that is the previous year the new Yasha all these qualities Frances would put tincture Bernard shamsher butanna Agati Inga team they did beat down a bit the archer sahaja Ivana T we call the priest asked about the krishna is having if you see in the character of the sri krishna whatever the chakra cha is stealing all those qualities are present even the purana when they say be damn jar with the object he knows what is really good and also what one should not do a media ignores 16 chapter of the bhagavad-gita if you read the first three words even saying that these are the best qualities one should acquire and if he can then that person will become realized God so that least then from the fourth verse he says you all should know what are the things if you do not do then he gives a big list and he said I have told you so many good things but you should also know these bad things otherwise people would understand so he knows the big day Anna Bhatia because it is all it is his control ability are also so this walk leader without knowing that you will be able to realize God sometimes human being they are coming to you approaching you but if you don't have that capacity to understand the character of human being will be in difficulty you won't be able to continue in your spiritual but that man will come and they're very sweet tongue and slowly slowly tail they will take you to something else all your spiritual progress will be completely stopped so they also one should know how to deal with them how to avoid them with putting just in our shamsher when the creation is coming and when it is going to be dissolved poutama mom augur demon katene how they are traveling recently I was reading one article it has been published in the paper really very refined very oh the wonderful but at the same time terrifying story one boy one little girl she was born one here in America and then when she was three years old she fell and then she died doctors told that time but then when the doctors declared that if she is dead until she got up got back the life and totally different personality and she started telling I don't belong to display this is not my dress and it continued it is that behavior up to 17 years then she married a person in Mashhad and waited over there lately getting down and that she pitched that land and said after a long time I have come back to this place this is my place and then she told Savi there was a king she told I was the wife of the SEBI I belong to save me save he has come and entered into me I am going to live like a city it is all over there recently she has passed to it so all this can you imagine them with putting which have been are some tear it goes up like this and this bhutanam are the theme the theme this buta is not the body into the soul the individual soul friends we have assembled over here and today's Tuesday you are all busy tomorrow again you have to go to office usually you don't spend time like this but still you have come forward to understand what is religion to get the blessings of the goon and now it says who is it guru the Shankar Acharya says so trio original a calm water Brahm we do tomahawk ah he too could a aa single bond do anima Tom's Sepang now that was the God then is the Guru the God is having all qualities but the Guru also having the same qualities but we take wonderful hard to help the people so so three immersed in the vapors that means he has memorized the whole Veda no he has understood the import of the beta what is that be the only person came to his a great soul and asked what is this video then he'd applied those who have read the Phoenicians you know three with the readability her smile promo video Vedanti what happened to two types of knowledge is there work that Parra and morale and this opera vitia all the least Pura Vida yah-ha-ha Ramadi community yeah yeah by which the death of Sharon unchanging Adi combative one can understand that which is unchangeable that is Brahman that is Paramatma that is the soul that is God the one who has realized that what he becomes Brahma we'd bring my you have a body and after passing that you're studying five years long years to become a doctor then when you get the certificate and the graduation ceremony after that you start writing dr. so-and-so and then you are capable that means from movie the knowledge you have already within you spiritual knowledge Brahma be don't make of everything so that spiritual knowledge when you have AK word that has become your life then what happens so 3r he knows that old Veda sometimes some people say so three means those who know the karma kanda in the bay that there are two karma-kanda jnana-kanda I think it is a whole vida a bridge know seamless how it is sinless there is not selfishness to stillness calm water the seamless immediately or calm or the no desire because the person is not having the desire so no selfishness so that way it becomes Brahma be good tomorrow drama B drama B / jaan raghav Adama the highest form of that knowledge one who has got it and to only qualities one or brigitte o sinless and also a calm or the no desire and as because there is no desire his mind is completely pure how it becomes pure to existence the one is spirituality spirit another is all this phenomena when I am off from the phenomena and not a test with the phenomena not want all this thing what it becomes goes to the spirit to the God so it becomes completely seamless so see and sinless means only this do seen as in this means only this do sometimes some people tell lives oh they are sinful and all the sometimes they're stealing oh they are sinners but that Cena can become a very good person very holy person it can transform how because already it is there so that is telling if you understand these worldly things I don't want only to survive because and mind is there as long as it will be there I will just behave in this way but I am NOT attached to this whatever is necessary it is okay but I'm not attached to this so this is called from mummy to Tama bactine wonderful quality of the bull or he could they are simple they are the compassion the love why because all that I see is nothing but the manifestation of the same Lord the sometimes some people are really very critical and you like to hurt them but still okay let us continue and sometimes you look that much we see that in the life of the ones around Krishna one person was there constantly to decide is to criticize around Krishna and Saddam Krishna kept him just near to him and he used to watch when the people are entering that managed to say and said I'm Krishna good here used to say why you are going to that man is an in literate person you don't read the scripture I read the scripture come to me and surround distance to enjoy the conversation and think of the love I do there is no hate to there is no reason it to his reason no reason that he loved but I love that is called spiritual person bond who that he is the frame he is holding a time thinking how to help the people sometimes some people come for different type of health monetary help in a social problem these dead do I'm not concern but we should try our best to help them and sometimes some people means this only inspiration there solve so the bundle are Nova Tom's a Tom what dishonest are good people those who are not good going to make problem with the society we're going to make problem for other people no we're not really in that way rather I we pray for you so these are the qualities of the guru so 300 Regina sinless Oh calm water without any desire he is the Brahma be poutama as you have you realized from man some people what is the realization do you these are the two qualities if you have I have realized one month and I see everything so this is the speciality of things we have to reach over there but it is not so easy because of desire because of the selfishness we are born women because we born that proves that we are having the selfish desire we have to go beyond that and then it says so what is God mile with the Chaitanya what is Jeeva am God going to Jatin what is our car we can say the unit admire one unit small unit over there Jatin a children is there now if the issue is the Maya you remove the Mayan and remove the honker what remains Marlee Chaitanya so I and God are saying because we are chained and yet I have to remove my ego and I have to remove the Maya from God and then there remains only Chaitanya and that is the ultimate of all this spirituality good is the personification of the spiritual wisdom personification of spiritual wisdom and in a Hindi couplet it says certitude and Pali breathe guitar way beyond curry oooka-deesh this very simple if you can have a very good guru a preceptor a person of not what he will do he will only make the three the bat away he will say these are bad things and this is a good thing pilla petha way beyond correct age and that is the knowledge my son my daughter you should not do this my children you should not be able ike this try to do this and sometimes do unique no sometimes they'll laugh at you but he will go run after them no no no no please please please Yanik alley-oop - then there is a giving an example you know what happened after that Kyla my love Nora hail Kyla the cold my love so dirty they're cold many of you have not seen perhaps those were born

makes it fire it burned and that dirty thing the black thing it becomes the fire and so that is but how to realize this knowledge that the big deep running party Nam hurry brush Nina Sevilla the tree till now I come down to shisha the god guru and the shisha what the she will do the person the disciple what he should do he should go and do the service to good what type of service that guru becomes happy that type of service and then he should ask question to guru but it pristine not like that a group of people came from eg you are from India which part of India I don't know to some part okay this part and in this book what particular a tour shall I give you the address of my house I don't know the house is there or not but you can impair are you going to write my biography I can help you why you have come unnecessarily it go on half an hour and see we have to be very very patients after that also I give the candy I didn't ask him to cut it at a charity game so this is the sometime people they can't do not know what to ask but to spend time like this but with the pranipatena first you have to be humble there are people very highly qualified people but unless you are humble you won't be able to learn but it Pristina then say bye up the tree first you have to be humble second you have to ask question and third you have to do some Seba service to Boone and then only this possible the friends this is the three steps disciple guru and the God and what happens provinces on kishna say he said can you please repeat after me papa doctor palawan palawan Papa and vagabond and he is asking all those people they were believing something else not clear - Salam business philosophy they are Brahmas and many of them dish to criticize Salam Tichenor but ketchup chunder shan is to
