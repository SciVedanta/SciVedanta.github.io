this beautiful sloka tabaka Tom rhythm dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten calm Asha pom stubborn among golem srimad artem booby green on de bourr√©e dodgin ah so salam krishna sate faith faith and faith the faith on wat there it says the faith in the existence of God faith in oneself that it says faith in the existence of God because we cannot see God right now we cannot touch him we cannot feel so obviously the only option is believing the faith now faith in oneself I will surely see God and two things are there salam o Krishna repeated faith faith faith Bashar Bashar Bashar what is that faith fit in the existence of God how I know that there is God those realized Souls they have spoken about God they have given the description of God so from that only we can understand and we develop our faith on the existence of God then another field one cell what is that I will surely realize God where the others will be i don't know but i will surely realize god is the wonderful their self-confidence shastra Gruber Kashia such a Buddha Oh Buddha arnhem it says in the Shankaracharya what is faith shastra sia guru baka what is sastre there's the revelations of the realized Souls after revelation after seeing all these realizing all this then only they are mentioning not on the assumption that is the speciality what is the scripture what is the difference between the other books and the scripture the books are just imaginary the writers imagining thinking and because having the control over the language beautifully explaining it that is the different thing but this is after realization after feeling seeing knowing then only he is writing or telling there is God as you always hear from the Salam tishnar there is God and I am Telling You swearing the name in the name of my mother there is God I have seen I talked with her you too can do that and that is called realization the each and every word of this person is shastra is a scripture then we get the faith in the god from the words of this type of people then we see ourselves I have achieved so many things I can also realize God that fit should be there oh no I don't know what is going to happen can I not like that whatever I have done so many other things also as a human being I have done some mistakes some Foley's there's no problem I will simply go to God and say I'm sorry for that that's all and sincerely I am Telling I am NOT going to repeat I am sorry but I want your grace and surely the grace will come so that is the self-confidence I am surely going to realize God we doubt that self-confidence it is impossible to realize God so fast how to develop the faith by hearing the words of the realized soul by seeing the life of the realized soul unless an icy until I see the example before me how they are leaving how they are behaving how they're as they call the whole life demonstrating the existence of god that's why bhagavan sri ramakrishna said you must see among saadu in the night in the day that means all the time then only you should believe otherwise not if there is any desire for the world things night for sure he is not a realized soul but the desire what type of desire for the selfish desire but for the betterment of others if there is desires of the air it is not desire that we have to understand again when some people going out and trying to help others enlightening others material health medical health educational health or the gaana donna that is not a desire so when we think that way sometimes some people give the argument this is also desired salam o Krishna himself said these are not the desire this is tapasya service this is tapasya by meditation this is tapasya chanting the name of God all those things are helping us to realize God so by hearing the words of the realized soul and also seeing their life observing their life learning from their lives second stage by analyzing and practicing this is analyzing and practicing exactly what he is doing can I do that it's not possible because that is always some people they are so high in different activities even it's not possible suppose someone wants to become a poet he has that emotion he has that feeling and he can express that feeling in writings also but immediately if he thinks that I am going to be like the ribbon do not take her or a writer like the six peer or the famous the writers it's not possible so that is why analyzing I have to analyze what i am going to do how i am going to do lord buddha he practiced austerity unthinkable sri ramakrishna practiced austerity unimaginable in the lord chaitanya that austerity is it possible for any ordinary person to do by seeing if you think oh it is not possible no not like that possible in my own way in my own with into my own limitation but I will do I will start so analyzing discrimination first I have to analyze this is my path and i am going to realize God and these are the way I am going to take that is very very important but the spiritual life when one is going to accept a spiritual life then only these things are coming and Dean practicing how I can practice one monk he wrote to the mother Marshall a domani devi mile all those d these days i am practicing taking the name of God in the morning in the afternoon in the evening the night but still I am not really seeing anything the mother told you have left your heart and home we have become a mom you don't have any other other thing to do except taking the name of God that you do while you are complaining do you think that God is there sitting over there ready the moment you take the ten thousand names and you will come and appear before you it is up to him whether he will come or not it is your duty to go on practicing because you do not have any other responsibilities but for them household it's only in the morning and the evening can you take little name of God that will be sufficient so there are different type of instructions because they are already bearing or taking the responsibility of so many other things helping the society helping the family so obviously their burden is less entally this is sufficient if you can remember God and try to be free from the ego it will be all right for you and slowly slowly they are building up we will read from here how the same thing happened so analyzing and practicing how I will practice that also I have to fix up I have to understand and I have to move this is my bath and I am going to do in this way sometimes some people they are practicing for a long long time seeing that if we get the inspired oh you will also do that we will end up by losing our mental balance because everything has its limit I don't have the capacity so these are the very important first faith faith faith see Ramakrishna see how to develop the faith by hearing or reading by knowing from the mouths of those from the words of those who have realized God but from someone is writing and wonderful poem never practiced in his character nothing is there he presented oh the Sun is setting these there and we are so much emotional he is very good not in that way Shankar Acharya is it bagged by curry shoved Oh Jerry shastra Vacchiano column by ocean we do some yet but booked a not to knock they they only enjoy but they don't get the liberation who who is doing this way so the life is most important all other subjects all other things all other vacations are very good they can do whatever but for among but for a spiritual leader character character character that is the only thing that it must be how I am going to judge that whether the person is a spiritual person or not by seeing is character and the character builds how his thought and the thought promotes action so action thought and the total personality the character they can you see this so that is then when a man Marge's himself in God the final fate how it comes though we are believing there is God but still not the one hundred percent faith when it is possible we know if we read the life of the direct disciples you will understand what faith means and that one show me ramakrishnan and the G you all know perhaps you have read it was raining and the shrine where C Ramakrishna's photo was the air there was a hole on the top and the water was dripping and he noticed it came and opened the umbrella hold that umbrella on that particular picture photo and stood there whole night if we had also k will change the photo there's no prob next day we will change the photo let it be or at the base we would have taken the photo somewhere else I ok it is alright we have taken care but he was thinking not the photo but the original see Ramakrishna sleeping if I touch him now if I remove him now if I try to shift him now he I will break his sleep I should not disturb him this is the faith and he was holding it can we do that we won't be why because we don't have that realization but he had that realization he saw it so how that faith the final faith one hundred percent faith will come through realization there's AC Ramakrishna said when a man Marge's himself in God he can no longer retain wicked or sinful tendencies you know another context is telling wicked or sinful tendencies those who are claiming that they are the people of God and at the same time they are doing something sinful shameful know it for sure that is not possible it can never be in whatever may be the path whatever may be the failed but the God is the same when you reach to that God when you realize that God then wickedness can never be only one thing will remain love love and love and that is the definition of God l.o.v.e without any boundaries so that is love that is the God without any expectation without any barriers of cars create anything anything so this is this and you punish odd also as we coated in the in our last class and those discussions that Mundek Oh Ganesha it also said in a wonderful way chitin tea service a messiah be gentle with the year grunty she don t server some Shia some Shia some Shia means doubts when the doubt complete doubt vanishes when we realized God when he see God there can never be an iota of doubt never so that doubt cannot be so big don t Read A a grantee as if it cuts asunder all the bondages Judea that we are thinking and then we are going to different things and trying to possess this is mine that is ease that is our nothing will remain all belongs to the same God and then it comes to perfect the faith so this is where it says but how one should practice now here the ceramic has suggested wonderful it says love of God there are traditional way in the Hindu philosophy the guiana karma bhakti and Jana so meditation the love and the circulus work also the knowledge discrimination therefore but the best way in the present present day see Rama Krishna is the present day God and he knows about the human psychology so obviously he understood it is not possible to discriminate some people the study they do that but very very few almost nil I will say who can really stand on that because it is very difficult in the life of ceramic ISNA also we find some of the people they are always to claim though we like the Ghana Maggie and he used to say I'm caw caw means the sky I am not touched by anything on a test the sky as so many dust and all those things are there when the thing can actually pollute the sky it is all as they called firmament so I am just like that all these things in this world it is not affecting me but the same person he took some known from somewhere couldn't pay it back so they that man went to the court and the people came from the core the police came and seized all his property and it was sailing out to pay back the loan and in that condition he was crying ceramic is not noticed and told why you are crying now whose property is this you don't belong to the property the property cannot be yours your core in Bengali and the Sanskrit and they say caw caw caw means the sky so your car you're a sky used to demand this is my property call afterwards so almost like this very difficult when something has pricked immediately they will cry oh my god so painful whose body is this why you a crime is anything happened nicely everything is positive people are appreciating i canno I am Johnny GaN amagi but if it goes against can I stand is very very difficult not that it's impossible it is possible it is possible but difficult very difficult and for the ordinary people ceramic ish nuh said love for God why because love is already there within our nature there is not not a single soul who is not having the love even the cruelest person is also having the love for something really so naturally that particular love which is already there within us if we are utilizing that love it is easy so love of God and 350 years before in the same india & bingle before ramakrishna and another spiritual great spiritual personality came and he taught the path of love for the realization of God and his name is Shri Chaitanya we know the three Chaitanya and now it is that movement has been very strongly propagated by international krishna consciousness iskcon the international krishna consciousness they are propagating but the bush Navas are different sects are their gurus are there the main place is brindavan and previously it was nadia now he is also there Nadia so dimm nadia chaitanya mahaprabhu came his disciple particularly neatly ananda caitanya and nityananda a deer spreaded the divine path of love among the general masses and three more master Masha is giving a wonderful description after 350 years the same love and the love passion for the God the love for God Sri Ramakrishna who was actually if worshiper of God is Kali the Tantra but he is going and attending a function organised by the bush nabha and he's very at home and people are encouraged seeing him and feeling as if again the chaitanya and it Ananda has come the founder of that so this is here he is giving the exam a description it was monday jun 18 eighteen eighty-three i am reading from the page 253 of the gospel of ceramic esna sri ramakrishna had been invited to the great religious festival at pawnee hottie near calcutta it's still there I attended one function once I wanna have a brahmacari we all went to attain that program this festival of flattened rice they call chilla mahotsav maha sabha mahasabha cresskill flattened rice was inaugurated by raghunatha das a disciple of sri chaitanya it is say that raghunatha used to run away from home secretly practice his devotions and enjoy the Bliss of spiritual ecstasy one day Nick Cannon the say to him heap you run away from home and enjoy the love of God all alone you hide it from us I shall punish you today you must arrange a religious festival and entertain the devotees with flattened rice since then the festival has been annually celebrated at panihati by the bush neighbors those who are believing that all this is nothing but the manifestation of the Lord Vishnu the followers of Vishnu are known as Bosh nabha and the Vishnu the Lord Vishnu again has taken the form Krishna and Rama Rama and Krishna are the embodiment of or the incarnation of the busines incarnation cannot be from Vedanta is always from bushna but the incarnation of Vishnu is Rama this Krishna and ceramic Krishna again so this is the path of bhakti so here it says you must arrange since then the festival has been annually celebrated at panihati by the bush Navas thousands of the followers of sri chaitanya participate in it it is chief feature in the singing of the name and glories of the God and dancing of the devotees in religious follower the center of the festivity is the temple of the Radhakrishna built on the bank of the ganges here we find that a little description who is this person since raghunatha dasa this Lagoon adarsh he was the only son of the king of shop degrom shopto mean seven a gramma means village the subgraph was very famous in those days because that time india is a very great country and the sutter graham was a very famous province in the bingo we have been gone this Bengal particularly in the Bengal the sub degrom Reavers were there and from there the boards and people is to send out all the nature of the business center these two are a lot of money and he was the son of the king of subtab drama obviously we can understand even whatever that they say the annual income of the raghunatha das family in those days 20 lakhs rupees you can imagine in those days of the chaitanya mahaprabhu if anyone is earning 20 lakhs per year the youth song they were so rich / people and this person this young boy his to secretly go out to meet such a turnon because he was fond of going and talking and made taking the name of Lord but his father never liked it jaton came to shanty poor from puri and raghunatha went to see there he revealed his heart to the Lord and begged him to take him to Puri but chaitanya instructed him to go back home take care of his duties with a mode of detachment and worship shri radha krishna in the mind because his father was not a devotee of the chaitanya or radha krishna so in those days the bush never stays to work the radha krishna but most of the people in Bengal days to worship goddess Kali Shakti so that was and other other gods and goddesses were there so that's what chaitanya mahaprabhu didn't big and these are very important sometimes some people they thing you can just come and can become a monk no it is not this netaji subash chandra bose he once came to the ramakrishna mission to become among in those days the Xiaomi in charge he said no it is not your place so you go and serve the country your motherland in a different way and that will please show me be bacon on the but you cannot become a monk so this is the way they can judge recently they say in the present day our indian prime minister he also came to become wrong he is a student of our veterans home and then the schwa me present president schwa me of the ramakrishna mission they said call it promotes wah me sometimes in that Madrid so this Swami told no you cannot become a mom you better serve your motherland in a different way so these are the things sometimes happen this boy also came to Chaitanya and wanted to become his follower leaving all his duties in the home he said no go back and do the duty then he said with a mood of detachment do all your duties but with the mood of detachment he assured him that he would meet him in jagannatha puri as he returned from the brindavan with broken heart laguna went back home and took care of his worldly duties according to that instruction of the chaitanya his parents became very pleased to see this transformation does his paint about two years at home and sometimes this his father is to bind him and sometimes is to keep him under lock and key and 11 guards were employed to the day and night is to take care of the boy so that he should not leave home this happen it happens sometime like this row Gounod got news that the neat ananda has come to pawnee RT this Nithyananda he was born in b-room district and the name of the village was eco chakra the eco chakra was the village and the district was be room again it is in Bengal his father was Mukunda ogia and mother but Dorothy they called padmavati and this is a very interesting thing happened I don't know how many mothers will do it now once an ass he came in the house of this particular boy and seeing the boy for begging in essence the room here and there for baking so once and yes he came to that house for baking and seeing that boy he said I don't want anything else but that boy give that child as an elm to me can you imagine if we go and ask give your son to me what will happen I will be in the admitted in the hospital but you know what happened that mother but mabuti gave that child at hand up there some Yahtzee and that sannyasi gave the name nithyananda to the boy afterwards he became an Abba duta a padutha means a sannyasi of the order of contra they don't then they don't belong to any rules and regulations of the scripture they are free about hooters this is a very high position so they can be in the world they can marry they can settle in the household right butta butta they will remain and they can be monk so he became a monk he started wandering all over like the free year and then he met Chaitanya to Nityananda and Chayton they became very friendly became two brothers and also the disciple he started accepting chaitanya mahaprabhu as his master chaitanya mahaprabhu told we have to save these worldly people and the only way we can do that by spreading the name of Krishna but is simple because that was under the rule of the nabobs the Muslim rule that we have already discussed in one of our lecture you go and deliver the name go to each and every village to every ER a house and tell them to take the name of God so this mahaprabhu is to do like that nityananda and this Nithyananda when he was doing like that he came over here one day rohana got the news that nityananda came to Pawnee aati this is the pan Yeti near to his house and he immediately went to me see that person this is that wonderful some people as because they are already having the samskaara that is why when the Hindus they say is the samskaara that means the impressions from the past and past life is there these are the proof the immediately he got that some I must go and meet why because he is a religious person and he belongs to this and this zoom the cars and naturally I will go and meet as because nityananda he was spreading the name of Krishna and that too at the behest of the chaitanya raghunatha he was a devotee of chaitanya he came to me take another so this way it goes and when the unit came see he was afraid if I go and meet the people may report to my father and father will begin angry so he was from the distance he was looking at him offering the pranaam nityananda after taking a bath in the deep in the ganga he was sitting on a stone slab under a banyan tree still the banyan tree is there and he was sitting there from the distance this boy he was offering his pronoun noticing him he called him and he was hesitant to come near he forced him to come then he said youth he instead of coming near you stay away at distance now that I caught you I will punish you what is the punishment because he was reached returning the new so he said make a festival and feed all my associates with yogurt and cheap tries the he and Chiara they called the e and chera as a very tasty food you can try so that then this day he and Kira that he then hearing these ragunan became so pleased because this is nothing for him use a rich man so he said okay immediately send his own main to the village to purchase the chipped rice yogurt milk Swedes suger and bananas and organized a wonderful feast innumerable people attended the festival so that is the tradition still it is going on now afterwards it goes to the one house jacana and it can and the hint and from there only written on the told before eating the food you should take the name of God and that is hari hari and then you have to dance we have come here or not for the only for the food you have to take the name of God and you have to dance then only you can in anthem on we used to feed kitchari you know that kitchari and the cook used to put their wonderful very testy kotori and many people after testing that there's to keep information when we are going to offer the treachery and right from the raw fishes this to come and see it and because the seats were limited and a group after group these two seat over there it's not in the that used to distribute by hand is to seat and take these people instead of going to the temple this to come straight to the kitchen and seat over there from the temple when I came and saw this faces I never saw them in the temple I told have you been to Temple no show me G we have come over here to take per shot that look very good but whose Prashad the gods Prashad the which God there is the temple he is there is good I will reserve your seats over here you will get the first opportunity but it is better that you go to the temple at least see which God we have worshipped and then come ok since you are telling so there is to go like that sometimes we have to force people we have to urge them that please take the name of God so here also we find the Nithyananda he is asking the people before taking the Prashad who's Prashad Lord hurry take his name and then when they were taking that name of the pressure re Lee dance and when they were dancing it joined in the the in the Krypton this is called this very special and that is the practice of the bush nabha dancing and chanting the name of re i went to the one of the place and they're all so i spent the whole day to observe how they are practicing the religious practices as we do early morning we come and we meditate than acharn then you do puja then we do some other activities work and all that answering the laterz meeting the people arranging other things and then again in the evening in the noon time we practice meditation except etcetera so this way it goes in our how they do I saw almost eight times they are dancing they will be coming for 10 to 15 minutes they will go on surrounding the temple and then they'll go on dancing and chattering uttering the name of Lord Krishna hurry hurry hurry Krishna Hari Krishna and that is their practice and it is a very old practice introduced by nithyananda sri chaitanya then they were doing like that the continuation of the story that that rohana pundit in panjaa t is a special visiting during the chilla here see Ramakrishna away is going to him and he was invited by the bush nieuwe to go over there that is called the festival of the flattened rice master had been invited to the festival by Monisha who was the custodian of the temple now the person at the time of the Lamb Krishna ROM ROM means the devotee of ceramic ISNA in the writer of this and Rakhal afterwards who became a sannyasi Shami Bramha Nanda Baba not a great soul homes Ramakrishna's to love very much and if you are the disciples went with the master in a carriage on his way to panihati ramakrishna was in a light mode and jerked me the youngsters this is also very special though he was a very exalted mood he used to be and we can imagine the incarnation of God see Ramakrishna but sometimes used to make lot of fun with the young boys also so sometimes people is to forget that he is as such a excellent or exalted spiritual personality just joking pulling legs cutting the like these just let a young person so here this is in a light mode see Rama Krishna is going he and joked with the youngsters but sometimes used to tell the master Marcia he is he was 30 years old in those days 30 means agit person so he used to say ceramic is nice to master wash a neighbor's to join in this does the because he's an old man he is not joining in this at 30 years man so that way I ramakrishna wanted that people should be very happy and then that's very simple time and sometimes in the particularly those who are practicing their spirituality the Bromwich errands and long leaving everything we have also seen in the ramakrishna mission I was in God Vitas trauma that the senior Schwalm is is to say you must read some books the very light type of books funny books so that intense practices that we are doing sometimes you can relax and have some friends make some jokes do some games like that the simple things like that so we used to do that so wish to practice in that way the great Swami Rama gambier Ananda g used to say the young boys must do that another show me who was the president time an onion onda he used to say like that you should have a frame with whom you can just talk very another very simple way and have some other discussions also that is necessary salam o Krishna applied that psychology and as because they leave everything nothing remained so obviously this is also necessary and he was going like that but as soon as the carriage reached the place of the festival the master to the utter amazement of the devotees shutting to the crowd look at this immediately the same person the moment he saw the crowd taking the name of God immediately that God was eased as Eve and he jumped out of the garage and ran mixed in the crowd and his companions had to search for him it is so difficult to find you over there now the devotees he joined the krypton party of navadeep goswami different Goswami's different the the teachers is to have their own disciples and students and this to have different small small group he went there monisha ins guru and dance totally forgetting the world so if you are dancing for the name of God in them in the name of God you are not a bad that where the people are watching me or not how they will think it is a joy and so much of joy it is impossible to express that joy so that comes out in the physical form dancing form the shiba when he became extremely joyful it danced and from the dance on thee all this thing was created that is in the piranhas they say because the shiva was so much enjoy so Anand earth imani bhutani jayanti so in the piranhas they say the Shiva out of his great joy when he was dancing then those who are very crooked type real time very selfish type they were crashed under his feet and he was spreading the joy all over the world tando veneta the shiva tandava is not only he is killing but you're also creating so that joy that creation came in the vibration and from that tremendous joy unspeakable joy this old world was created afterwards Upanishad is telling Anand Ava kalu imani bhutani jayanti do we find these in the personal in the person of ceramic ISNA again and again he is demonstrating and in this way he went and started dancing every now and then he stood still in Samadhi carefully supported by navadeep Goswami for fear he might fall to the ground thousands of devotee were gathered together for the festival wherever one looked there was a forest of human heads is a beautiful ways explaining the forest of human heads only people the crowd the crowd seemed to become infected by the Masters divine father and sway to and fro chanting the name of God until the very year seemed to revive Brett with it drums cymbals and other instruments produced melodious sounds that most fear became intense with spiritual power the devotees felt that go wrong himself was being manifested in the person of Sri Ramakrishna flowers were showered from all sides on his feet and heide shouting of the name of hurry was hard even at a distance like the rumbling of the so if one can read it carefully and then imagine how it would be then you can imagine the way three titanum operable to spread the name of early so that is the difference because sometimes I feel that I should show I'm a play over here as a CD one of our swamiji the young swami here sang a beautiful song with Ramakrishna is to like very very much this nick cannon then Chayton now they are two brothers as if spiritual brothers they were disciplined the Guru they are coming they are both God but still there are chanting the name of God that song someday I will play over here very simple but the wonderful way jardel horrible Tino injury those the moment the art at the name of hurry and they cry they eat these two they have come and again and again in as a Krypton they say the same word in a different day using this different words but same way wonderful song that particular song he sang in a very excellent way I listen to it again and again so that is the expression expression of joy and joy of love how that love can come again going back to the first sentence faith faith faith faith sometimes some people they can sing so wonderful way but that is a different thing the melody that will force you to dance there's different thing but when you are uttering the name of God and dancing that is a different because the whole mind in now going upwards and once again you are revealing yourself that i am divine I don't have any human body add add joy it is impossible to explain in words except one realizes it Sosa Ramakrishna he was showing this and the people they failed or DC's were achieved the chaitanya mahaprabhu then see ramakrishna entered by turn into all the moods of ecstasy in deep Samadhi he stood still his face radiating a divine glow in the state of partial consciousness he danced sometimes great gently and sometimes with the bigger of a lion the master mache and whatever weight is possible he is giving a wonderful description sometimes when he is in the top mood he is in Samadhi when the mind is coming down a little the semi-consciousness here is not having the consciousness of the body but consciousness of the surroundings then he is dancing and dancing sometimes gently and sometimes with the bigger of a lion again the gaining consciousness of the world is sang himself leading the chorus behold the two brothers have come this is the same song who weep while chanting hores named JD hurry Bolton I on Jerry Tara para do I is a cheery they D who cry in the name of God hurry they have come the two brothers and he was thinking when the kitten was over money Shane took see ramakrishnan navadeep Gachet money Shane is the person who was arranging and his guru was not deep goswami now they say one gentleman is to say that he has written those who were Brahman days to take the the surname as Goswami in the Boche Nava and those who had non bruh means their daughter so raghunatha dasa and he is a goswami so this Goswami they are very highly respected in the that fish Nava called the wind the curtain was over- sheen took see ramakrishnan about Deb dashami into a room and served them with the refreshments other afterwards rom aim and other devotees were also served with their Prashad now we see how the Ramakrishna he came 350 years after TJ tanya again to reestablish the Sanatana Dharma and he tube different ways sometimes karma the work unselfish work sometimes the devotion and sometimes just as a missionary used to go and meet people the group's different varieties of groups used to go to the Christians and used to go to the Brahma samajis he is to go to the Hindu pundits traditional pundits used to go to different houses and everywhere used to go within one only purpose to make people aware that they are divine and their goal should be to realize God and that way is to do that that is called missionary work the ministerial job wherever they go whatever they do only one idea to make people aware that they are divine sometimes in different faiths the thing the people are doing mistakes to save them from that so they should not go and suffer in the hell that is the different idea but here it says if they go and tell them your goal is to realize God and you must try to do that realize God and in the afternoon the master was sitting in mana Shane's drying room with the devotees the nathi was also near key navadeep means the Guru of minee Shane money offered the carriage higher to see Ramakrishna that is the tradition whenever a religious person goes to somebody's house they are supposed to pay team up and down fear so that should be so in our Parliament to religion group they invited us we will do you know the tradition Hindu tradition you are supposed to pay our up and down fair after the ruta the salt lake city so so they are wondering so this is the tradition when you are asking a religious person to come to your place you are supposed to feed him you are supposed to take care of him and the passage money up and down fear and because prone Ami Mon Ami means the offering should be given suppose they are coming from an organization but the sake of the organization and also for the personal even ceramic ich nur said you should not meet a holy person just bare handed you something you should do otherwise where they will get the money one person went to Kashi and when came back see Ramakrishna was then carrying him what did you see you were there he was narrating these days then he said I made a monk I liked his words as to go to him but one day and then some Christian said have you paid something no he was asking some money for the smoke and I I told and what did you do I said okay i will give you next day then I left I didn't give him so now Christian say you didn't pay no no he was asking for the money for the smoke now what is there see the mind of ceramic ISNA you are enjoying so many things in this world and that person only loves to enjoy some smoke and he didn't hide it he was very clear open he told and what how much money only one Anna in those days and one on a fraction only 16 part of a rupee so that only he wanted and that also you said that i will give and you didn't keep your word what type of person you are so this way or sometimes we the mistake but they say sometimes some people would say oh our guru never touched the money until your guru didn't touch somebody else on his behalf okay otherwise how the work will go in there in the organization you are supposed to understand these so this is the ceramic isness teaching and moni gave the courage in one house II went and they were not ready to give any money and ceramic Krishna was sitting tight over there till they give the carriage money he won't leave the house you are sitting but la raja Mirage that is our swami ramanand the G he was the son of a very rich man the German dark is the landlord son so naturally he was feeling bad said let us go we will arrange no problem for this little money why should you sit over here then see Ramakrishna said no wait they have invited me they are supposed to pay why they should not pay and the ho there the mail folks are not there in the house some for some reason there but the women folk they know the mail for ghosts worse and they respect us and they have invited me they should give now after lot of argument then they gave all some money that to this 75 person of the total expenditure 25 person they said that will you manage the salon Krishna was why did he did like these you know only to bless them because the people sometime don't understand only to bless them otherwise this is very very harmful anyway he said why should they accept it from you here is a different the mana Shane he wanted to give that money the carriage higher too there are other ramakrishna pointing to rama and the others the master said when he was trying to give the money to see Ramakrishna master said I have come with the wrong rom was a doctor so he pointed to Sarah ram ram chandra doctor he said why should they accept it from you they are money look at it drama that ram chander his disciple he was a doctor he is earning money so he has come along its Ramakrishna he will paid he will take care of it why he should accept those who are earning in the household they should not accept anything from others why then the self-respect is lost but that is the main thing sometimes same thing happened in our lives also when you go to some place they would say Swamiji can you give them because you have you know the gash you have purchase for that some money it will have come with a devotee why should he take from you if you need to give anything give us a donation to the vedanta society that is all right but why that person should take so this is the norms when you read the gospel of ceramic ashna we find how the society should behave with the the people who have renounced their announcers they behave like this then he he became engaged in conversation with the nevada goswami and the word he said bhakti that the devotion that he showed over there bhakti matured becomes bhava in the in our next discourses we will
