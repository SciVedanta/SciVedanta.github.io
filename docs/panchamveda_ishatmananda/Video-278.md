[279. Panchama Veda 279() : Let God Hold Our Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W69g89X4kJk)

okay good evening dear devotees and friends today winston will be studying the hospital return the nectar seeing facing utterances brings life and hope to they are extrolled by wise sages and the mere listening to them should bestow auspiciousness on all they confer every prosperity those who spain them broadcast are verily magnanimous they distribute what is completely satisfying to the ears so this is the translation of the famous words from the gopi gita tabok so we have many times discussed about it but sometimes we say the meaning because after many classes we may forget and we may wonder what is the meaning of this verse so when we listen what happens and we start thinking and this mind this thought is the main in our life as they say when you are doing it in your mind when you are performing it in your mind that is the main performance so friends when we are listening that's why on the hearing when you are reading that is also sending all those information to our mind and when you are hearing the same effect is coming but how it will come if himself and who has realized god who has complete idea about god when he says like that those words in a very simple day-to-day way they will be telling but we can understand how things are taking that changing in our it's completely taking a different shape in our mind so this is exactly what we were studying in our last wednesday that we read bhagavan's that he was telling the bhabha grana adaptations of the nature of the deity in the last wednesday we discussed about it adaptation of the nature of the deity this is very important shipping a deity a god i i like i love i worship but i do some ritualistic thing i pray and i believe that god is listening god is accepting my offering it's good but how i will know that i am truly loving that god worshiping that god the qualities of that particular god will slowly manifest in my character in my nature that will prove that i am truly worshipping that god so bhagavan siddharama krishna is telling if you are worshiping lord siva and naturally you are you will manifest the characteristics of the lord discussed the characteristics of the lord shiva it is on love it is all sacrifice and there is no selfishness so it is all purity so these are the things bhagavatam krishna said again and again nam guna kritan the lord that we are taking usually the hindus the buddhists all these traditions they have initiation process not the vedante because their initiations are different viranth is different so kim of god from some guru and he asked us to go on repeating that name and when you are repeating that at the same time they'll be asking you better leave the biograph read the biography of these or that slowly slowly you will learn the qualities of that particular god and he will try to imbibe those qualities bhagavan's sri ramakrishna truthfulness completely truthful completely ego free no selfish motive all purity and all love all sacrifice these are the qualities so if we are claiming that we are the followers of bhagavan si rama krishna we should manifest those qualities within us and that will be the symbol that we are truly becoming religious but evidential those who are following the path of lord jesus the jesus was all love all sacrifice so naturally we have to if we see that love for each and every being that sacrifice for each and every one and the great heart who could pray for those who were torturing him killing him so these are the qualities and if we are following that then only it is possible so what is the spirituality religion why we read the holy books to understand these some abstract qualities are there but when we just read about that we don't get we read the life of that some then we can follow then we can understand it is possible we can't do that as he did it so that lives only a burning lamb can start lighting other lands otherwise just some quality is a list of qualities you must have those that won't make the people inspired that is why the guru guru means one who is removing the darkness darkness of ignorance so the guru in the form of a human being he may come and he can tell you this but actually indicating the god the this is what exactly happened here in the bhagavad-gita krishna he he said bhabha graham this important teaching then when we are accepting vishnu when you are accepting vishnu we will be having the qualities of the lord vishnu that manifested in the life of sri rama shri krishna and sri ramakrishna all that is vishnu's qualities and the visnu all pervading the god so when the god is all pervading when the god is the manifestation of each and everything so obviously i'll be the lover of the whole thing the universe that is the beauty of the dualist but sometimes we make a mistake in the beginning they will ask this is your god concentrate on this god and we think that is the end of it that is the problem the duality they they offer they say this is your god and you must concentrate on that we do that then we don't imbibe those qualities and we think as because this is my god or goddess no other gods and goddesses i am going to worship and those who are following those paths or those gods and goddesses they are my enemies it cannot be the no that is a mystic misunderstanding that is the reason when we read the gospel of siram krishna the book of religion gets open we can truly understand what is true religion a devotee how can one see god at the last time this question related in reply those you have those who have gone through the pages of the the gospel of suramar krishna the students of the gospel of sirama krishna you all know in the beginnings ramakrishna said in reply to this question that you must go to a secluded place you must have the company of a holy person you must analyze your mind discriminate and then nirjanabash these are the four the disciplined one should follow that's bhagavan's ramakrishna said what is shadow this understanding the qualities of the god what is spirituality what is religion what is god if we don't understand that and the superficial or god means something very powerful can do anything of course it can do but why he will do but the god can do everything but the question is if he is just favoring me he has to favor everyone the how it is possible how the things will go so the question of the karma follow comes have you done this before the obviously the result will come to you so these are the karma followers we understand oh my god all the suffering that today i am having karma of the my past life i must be careful in this life then the scripture says the guru says yes whatever you do in this life you take in your next life and the lives of lord with the 500 times lord buddha could remember his birth and he gave that that's the jaataka kahini the jaataka the stories of the jaataka means again and again he took birth in different form different name in different place but constantly his mind was on that righteousness the morality so that is the way slowly he developed so that means we must be careful about our work what type of work again the scripture will teach you that there are three types of work from the physically that you do then intellectually mana that you are doing and through bachika through words that you are telling when a leader says something that affects that is the inspiration or whatever that goes to the millions of minds so leaders should be very very careful those who are very popular people every single word of them accepted by the millions must be very careful what they are telling so these are the things baachika karma when you are saying about someone giving a report to someone which who is powerful you must be careful am i giving that truthful statements or just giving my own mental words that i am thinking that the raja the king the ruler or has the power to take action against that particular person he'll be influenced by your words that one should be very very careful now we read in the history in the second world war there was the guebbles and he was in the in the german and he used to develop all the false statements and used to send out so that the opponents they will lose their heart and this way that maybe in the in the war what they are doing i am not going to comment on that but the thing is those who are trying to be spiritual one must be very very careful if you are following the path of religion baachika what you are telling that is also work that is also karma and sometimes we don't do feelings and we think i have not done it only i thought so i said but that is also the karma of allah so one must be careful again and we get it in the gospel of krishna in the that's why it is the panchama veda it's all knowledge knowledge one should be very very careful when you are doing physical work and the thought and the word that you are speaking so karma according to karma this is happening now because of my good karma i go to a good person and listen to his words all positive words very inspiring words and the prayer for each and every one that is spirituality that is religion go to that person who is talking about everyone loving everyone not out of emotion but out of analysis that each and every soul is nothing but the manifestation of god how can you heart others so you listen shadhu sangha all positive ideas and thinking then you go to a secluded place maybe for a day maybe 24 hours just cut off yourself from each and everything and observe your own mind what the mind is thinking can it leave when it is alone without talking if it is possible well now i know i can control my mind i don't need the company of others so that is the way analyzing the mind this type of thoughts are crossing in my mind i should be careful whenever that thought is coming immediately get alert oh no no no not this type of thought immediately go to your own god and pray god no no not don't give this type of thought that taking me down please please please then the help will come we are trying and the divine blessings are coming because if if we are trying to do good obviously the god who is nothing but the repository of the all goodness will bless us so the bichara then we are doing the first is sadhu-sanga second nirjan bash going to a secluded place and analyzing my own thought well the swami was talking like that and their lifestyles are different their sannyasins they have given up everything they don't have the social responsibility but i am agree i'm a householder i have my own responsibility what i'm going to do with this now some people they should think what i'm going to do with the my wealth and how i'm going to utilize it because time that we know that we're so that is the analyzing then coming to a conclusion i should do in this way i must help others i must pray for others i must think for others why no no just you know i am now i am very aged anytime anything will happen to me so i am just distributing my wealth and property no not like that way just because whether whether you distribute or not if you don't have any other thing then the government will take it the society will take it that is a different thing but if you are thinking well i have earned from the society i have lived my life now i must give back whatever is there with me keeping some portion for me and then let me be free because i have also taken many things from the society let me pay back and those who really needs help if they get the help that is that's why all the time in every religion they say that's the if you are giving money to the poor they are all suffering so i am trying to give little help why because they are also the same god living god so this is the way the bichara the discrimination each and everything is going to be destroyed including my body and the mind someday why not then put the mind at the feet of the god which is eternal that will be my ultimate goal the how i should do that prayer so so ramakrishna is telling first go and listen from a holy man so holy return then analyze your condition and then finally take the decision and take the refuge at the feet of the god that is prayer go and say god i am yours please help me but here in reply to this gentleman's question how can one see god sadama krishna is not telling all those he what he said those who hear he said completely direct your whole mind toward him here he is telling direct your whole mind towards the him he say whole mind now this is again in the mind means thoughts there's so many waves and waves and waves of thoughts then what we are going to do what type of thought we are thinking 24 hour we have to think of god how it is possible it's a there's a bengali the song not the whole song i am just picked up some lines or when i am eating i think that i am offering it to my god when i am eating if you can imagine my the god is sitting inside my heart and i am giving that food to him offering that just think imagine in that way that you are feeding your god offering that food to god and suppose we are just traveling we are going somewhere some work nagor peru i'm going to office i'm going to work i'm going different places and that time if you imagine that i am going on circumstance i'm doing the circumvillation as we go to the temple after offering my pranam i go to round the whole temple that is the hindus and the buddhists they'll be going round the temple circumbolation so i am going round and round and round and then sometimes the three times seven times 11 times they'll be doing it and offering the pranam so by that way why they go like that i offer the pranam to the in the front of the god then from the right side of the guard then from the back of the guard again i come in front of the guard everywhere only god circumvention why because god is everywhere most of the people just by habit they'll be going and they'll be getting round and then come out uh why you are doing it no this is the tradition we should do the but we if we understand that teaches us that god is everywhere in the front in the left and the right at the back on the above at the below everywhere only god is there and that is the reason this circumstance the system and we are we're going to the city but thinking wherever i am going it is only god god is here god in my office god in my restoration god everywhere wherever i go he is my best company my best friend and every time he is with me that is exactly what the ramakrishna said direct your whole mind towards him in the the our katopani and the it says qatar banished says atma now about our body we are so much attest to the body obviously right from the birth we are attached to the body we see the body nurture the body so by that way we become very imaginative the rishi is teaching us body he said itself the individual self the jivatma he is the captain he's a in that in the chariot he is the master sitting inside the chariot atmanam rothinam and this body is the car putting and my intellect that is the chariot the driver he is controlling everything he is driving mana praga macha and in those days that's because of the horse-drawn carriages so the pragma what are the praga that's horses mana the mind the mind is the horses and who is driving those horses controlling the sources buddhi and how he is doing it this is that is the bridle do you have to control that sorry it should be controlled by the mana mana is the bridle and controlling that indriyanam i missed that line indriyanam nahu aya is the horses what is that indriya all these chakshu karna nashika jivantak all the five indriyas are the highest at the horses oh that this it may create a habit if it is not controlled and my mind is constantly going somewhere why because i have seen something that i force the mind to go over there and who is doing it my eyes it's not control i cannot control it then my i listen to something i like to listen again and again and again i do it that one day the the seven years old child and she is constantly attached to the the phones you know that nowadays that and you must have to give a phone to other to the father and the mother constantly because they like to use a phone but if you don't give the phone to the child you won't do anything not reading not eating not going to bed everything so the attachment because she saw it she can play with that she listen some of the music from that it is a game for her she got attached to it a same way we are also there is a child only so having that attachment and when we are having those attachment we are bound by that we do not know how to come out so here the rishis of the punishers they are teaching you have to think your body that is the chariot that is the car but inside the car it is yourself who is the master and then who is driving is your intellect how it is controlling the horses that are drowning that is from with the mind mana and who are the horses that is five horses in a arjuna's the famous chariot because the eye the nose the ear the skin and the tongue the pancha the five pancha in they should go charon where they go what is the road road are the objects now this is the way we have to it's because it is a the vedanta they ask you must analyze every time and that is the way you should go and you have to control all your same organs the same's organs must be controlled i don't like to look at this i don't like to listen to this i don't like to taste like that i don't like to touch you are controlling horses so by that way cons it's not that easy just go to the virgin and everything is done not like that it's not that easy it's a complete transformation religion is national realization of the oneness my mind is projecting constantly projecting that there are so many varieties now i have to train up my mind i have to clean up my mind by that we know it is only the one god manifesting in different way and when you see the many variety anger will come jealousy will come then opposition will come like this it goes on exactly what is happening in our day-to-day life and then if we continue into that and think that i am following the spiritual path it's a wrong thinking the spiritual path is exactly opposite to that exactly opposite and when you think that i should grab spirituality will teach you give up when you are thinking to grabbing that is the worldly mind and you like to give up the sacrifice exactly oppose it so it is not so easy that is why the in the bhagavad-gita krishna said [Music] sahastra issue in millions and million among this only a few handful may try to become spiritual then siddhyanam full of people trying to be perfect maybe one or two they may be successful it is not so easy so we have to go back there's a strong current is going on and we are swimming again and we have to go to the source where from it has started the flow we have to go to that so it is a strong fight a long long faith and understanding and that's why the gospel of sudama krishna is so wonderful book every page bhagavan sirama krishna the god himself has taken the human form is teaching us in a very simple way now when the person uh said the how to realize god his answer direct your whole mind to and non-stop practice it's a long practice as i was school thing you must think at the time of sleeping you must think at a time working at the time of visiting walking every time you have to think it is god and god and god i am that i am that i am that so that is the way we can understand and then slowly slowly the mind will become purified acharya is feeling that the one should purify the mind the purification is very essentially okay how we are trying and it says that we are transformed by thinking positively that everything is nothing but god no stop going anywhere i will go but at the same time today we must think and he's talking with the he's giving an example bring and there's a funny story about in the life of vivekananda he was a young man who used to come to bhagavan sadama krishna these birds they only drink only the rain water there are rivers but it won't drink they'll be waiting for the rain to come and when the raindrops are coming and that they will drink the one day the young naren came he was 16 17 years that time he came and told sir that you told the chathaka birds drink only the rain water that is not correct i saw all the chataka birds drinking the ganga water bird where did you see it is that that bird a conception in the uh in the veda only and this is a it may be that it is species and the conception that chaat bharat is written in the veda if they drink only where you go to the chathaka bird here and now that took in the evening time drinking the ganga water i just saw ran towards the ganga and it was just blowing by his with the side of his room and then he understood that naren did a mistake all the bats they were coming down and trying to catch some of the insects and all and it is it was dirk and as if they are drinking the water or touching the water they were not touching the water and in the evening time you can see the millions the small small thing that comes up the living thing and this type of bats they will come and eat them naren saw that and then then sudama krishna came back and told hey you rascal you are trying to deviate me no this is completely different chataka so that the chat like the chataka we have to be only depending on the god friends today that i have given the name if we should request the god pray to god hold my hand so it is going like this and he is telling that chatagabad drinks only rain water though ganges and the jamuna rivers are full of water and though the seven oceans are full of the the water still the chataka will not touch them it will drink only the water that falls from the clouds he who has developed sati such a yoga can see god can one see god of course but who who has that one pointedness only god and nothing else that's why i was quoting this song that for every 24 hours every moment everything should be only god only god and only god so this is the way you have to he who has developed such yoga yuga means union union with god now whenever i'm speaking suppose i'm speaking today i'm just reading the book i'm trying to explain whatever i have understood after reading so that is the way and if i feel oh what the people reaction should be and what how they are going to accept god has given me the opportunity as an in charge of an asthma to read the book and i am reading and to my best ex understanding i am trying to explain it so that the people those who don't have the time to read it properly we'll listen to it and get some inspiration from the words of the bhagavatam krishna and lordly himself is listening siddharam krishna himself is listening mahasaratha swami all they are listening if i think in that way same explanation same talk that i am giving it becomes worship anything and everything that we are doing it becomes the worship so that is the way we have to feel that bhagavan sri ramakrishna is telling the you had he who has developed such a yoga can see god such yoga the union with god can see god every moment remember god suppose someone has come and i like to talk to him or her i should be gentle i should be attentive and whatever the problem he or she is having if i can solve it is okay if not that that way we have to handle than to tell why i am dealing with the god look at it when we constantly think about god our qualities of work is also developing is also becoming perfect when i am typing when i am writing every time if i think i am doing the god's job i must be careful so obviously all my attention will be on the work i am doing the god's work and the quality of the work will also improve someone is cooking when they're cooking just carelessly that is a different way but the moment he or she is cooking for the god they'll be devoted i have seen the people they are very fond of cooking for the god in a special location and they will get up in the early morning they will bathe wear the new clothes they'll go to the kitchen all new vessels they'll be using and very careful that everything should be in proper measurement the salt and the sugar and everything and naturally when they're offering to god they're concentrated if every day we do that not that you have to offer to god physically just think that i am going to offer it to god why god is not outside he is sitting inside me too so when i am eating apparently i am eating but actually i am feeding the god who is sitting within me within my heart same work just because of my thought the quality of the work that is also increasing developing becoming perfect my mind is also getting detached from the worldly objects but if i do it for the sake of the others the worldly people or the great person is coming i have to impress him i have to talk like this i have to offer like this if he or she is not impressed then that is a different you are deviating from the god so sudama krishna is telling those who are sincere to realize god they have to do and sometimes some people may ask if i am doing the same way in the offices that the boss may not be happy when the boss is asking to do the work in this way think that god wants to do that work in that way do that but when you are doing it do it perfectly so the naturally your company will get the benefit they will be paying attention to you this is a person giving us the lot of business everything he does is a wonderful way so obviously will be accepted in the society too god's blessings comes through that way so every day every moment we should remember god not only in the morning time and the evening time sometimes we say the oh we are all busy just in the morning just in the evening but slowly slowly slowly he understands and sadama krishna says you have to unify you with god for 24 hours he who has developed such a yoga can see god and it goes after a drunkard as drunk is leaker he talks only about the joy of drunkenness krishna giving the example why because in those days he saw he observed the most of the people you know that the people they were under the subjugation of the britishers and whatever the education whatever the equality they were not getting the the freedom to express so the depression was there so people usually at that time they go to drinks and many of the people they used to do the educated people and they used to drink a lot salami krishna observed that they drunker when he's full he talk about the joy of the drunkenness so this is this wonderful like that like that he'll be talking he's full with that his mind is full of that so that is the reason when a person is full of god he will speak about god only how you will know that a person is a holy person holy and he is a really religious person he or she will speak only deeper they are the discussions are going on they will only speak about the god and the references from the holy books like that way his whole mind is nothing but the god so that way we can understand oh this man naturally has reached to a good height in the spiritual life otherwise talking about the worldly things and all sometimes when you are doing it because of the organization but that too they are doing only for the god and they are prayerful those who are purchasing a plot of land developing a temple and for that collecting fund and contacting the varieties of work oh this man is worldly no no no no so not that we should not judge in that way that particular time the moment he everything that he is doing doing it for god only why if we can develop a temple over here and a prayer hall for the people around people can come they can sit over here they can pray they can read some good book and we can invite the good speakers and we'll be talking about the god and they can listen to those so i am trying to help the neighborhood to follow a holy path that is the goal not for my name and fame so that is also missionary work that is a completely different thing so this we have to understand when you are reading the gospel of krishna in every way it is helping us and every moment it is reminding us that we are gods ourselves and we should go back to god though we are handling these worldly things but the worldly thing should not bind us we should not get attracted today of lord buddha there is a the mara he was trying to tame to buddha in the life of lord jesus the temptations were also there and the devil was trying to tempt the lord buddha in life of each and every one it was there so we have to cross that those temptations name fame will and all those physical comfort so that is the reason that we should be very very careful those spiritual people should be very very careful so we are now nityogupal was seated in front of suramar krishna he was always in ecstasy he sat there in silence nitya gobel was a young boy he used to come to sirama krishna see these shows it's life that proves the past life past karma is a young boy but from that young age itself he developed lot of sattvaguna the good qualities and he used to think about god all the time and and in those age at that time the young boy they'll be thinking about the play they'll thinking about other things and to get achievement in the world life nothing like that he was constantly thinking about god and used to come and get soulless in the company of bhagavan krishna and he used to almost drink the words of bhagavan's ramakrishna bhagavan sirama krishna was very very affectionate to this nit to gopal master mashay knew him so this boy he was sitting in one corner of the room and listening and quietly he was listening master to nit to gopal smiling bhagavan sadam krishna now he's he looked to the nithya gopala and he's smiling and talking with him gopal why are you always silent nity gopal means why are you always silent bhagavan sirama krishna is asking why you are silent nitya gopal is giving the answer like a child he was a grown-up boy even then he was a i do not know this is very simple i don't know why i'm silent because i don't feel like talking you know there is a spiritual practice in the spiritual life they call the mona mona abalambana that you have to practice maybe three days or maybe even one day not talking with anyone not even answering the telephone not observing of the tvs or your computer just all alone quietly all day and when you get up you start and next day when you again go to sleep up to that maybe 12 hours 14 hours in three days maybe seven days and sometimes some people they practice one month well in one of my in my when i was a brahmacari i practiced one month at the mona and after one month you don't feel like talking because you are so full with him so that is the beauty and what you are doing without talking you are either reading the book or taking the name of god or meditating the three things usually they do in the beginning they say that if you like to start the mona you better sing the songs so that at least some sound will come out and you will listen to the sound and you will be happy that is in the beginning and afterwards slowly slowly they become completely quiet and that qual nitrogen is because he was always attached with the god he was so happy he said i don't know master i understand why you don't you are afraid of committing a transgression you were right jaya and bijaya were gatekeepers of narayana now srama krishna giving that because if you say something maybe that you are making a mistake some not the religious thing or the holy thing you may commit by that way so people are afraid krishna giving an example by quoting a story of the jaya and bijaya they refused that sanaka sanatana that that five brothers and the other rishis admission to the god's palace for this transgression jaya and bijaya had to be born three times on earth this is a story many of you know that bhagavan vishnu was resting and jaya and bijaya were guarding the door the gate and the lord said don't allow anyone to come in because i like to rest and now the rishis came so this is the way it always happened you know the rishis came this is the challenging challenges in the spiritual life rishis told see we like to meet the god right this moment jaya bijaya knew them they were very the very holy spiritual power and if you are not allowing us we will curse you now jaya and vijaya god told not to allow anyone rishis are telling allow us to go in and if you don't do that we are going to curse you what to do what the ordinary people will do they'll be afraid they'll say to the master sir what to do these people forcefully entered they didn't listen to us they we were afraid that they will be cursing us usually the people they decided now the master is taking rest and master asked us not to allow anyone and we should not allow anyone and about that curses that we suffer even if we suffer for three lives we should not disturb our lord and his rest but even for a few minutes that is the love for god so this is the story means when we love god we go like this way we think in this way i remember that you know our belured mark they always think and almost all the hindu temples that it is the presence of god and we treat god as a living person in the morning they will get up and they'll give their water to wash the face and then they will give some breakfast and then afterwards they will offer the puja then the lord with the fresh he will come and sit because he's the talking to them or seeing them then after the noon time he will eat his lunch and rest all each and everything in timely it goes as he used to do in the when he used to leave accordingly and also in the in the jagannath temple also they do like that a group of people came it was a fun for them in a group they are coming all the family members are there they will be taking group photos and they came way to that time it was almost that they were closing the temple's door and the food was offered to god 15-20 minutes you have to wait and then again it will open for a few minutes for a few minutes too so the people who are there they'll offer pranam and they will go they started crawling with the our the girls why the god's door should be closed we have come from these the god is eating can god eat like this so they know love for god but still they like to go and see that is only the temple that much the love for god means oh god is now he has it to eat okay okay okay we should not disturb or the god is resting very good we should not make any sound so this is the way one should feel otherwise the presence of god sometime inside the shrine one gentleman told you people don't allow the children to play inside the shrine i told sir we have such a big field over here they can always play outside now when their children are outside we cannot be inside so we have to so obviously we bring the children inside and if they don't get the to play how we can see it the concern not for god but for his own this is not inside the shrine if children are not supposed to play or go with the shoe and all that system so that we respect for god a love for god friends will conclude by this way but there is one thing you should remember now bhagavan srama krishna is telling when a boy walks holding his father's hand he may fall into the gutter but what has he to fear if the father holds him by the hand let god hold our hands that is our the topic holding our hand god holding our hand means we are having complete faith and if the that faith the god please hold my hand and i like to go along with you that helps a lot that means complete dependence on god if the complete dependence on god is not there then we cannot do anything this is the last word in spirituality depends on god as the baby depending on the mother wherever the mother will take her in whatever way the mother will keep she is always there and whenever she needs something cry for the mother so that is the way one should feel the i am depending on my divine mother the god so sirama krishna is telling when the god is then there is no problem for the child you will never so let us pray to god you are my father you are my mother i don't know towards you go to you but if you hold my hand i'm sure i'll reach to the destination and that is you and in a bengali song i heard i've forgotten and that the song was dedicated in that way the amar had told it to be near charlotte yet the shakha means the god is my friend so please hold my hand oh my friend and let me go towards you so how to go please lead me so that is complete self-surrender and depending on the grace of god that is the ultimate of religion because of the ego we cannot do that constantly we think oh i will manage i will do this i will do that but when slowly slowly the ego goes away we completely depend on god and we take that opportunity hold my hand oh god thank you friends and if there is a question let us say so the first question is from aruna kumar he's asking how can a person find a easter or a god or goddess to worship ishta means you know arnab this is you'll feel attraction then sometimes the if you go to a holy person and if he says this is your history that is also possible and sometimes you feel the attraction if you read about the god particularly bhagavan gapia bhagavan's ramakrishna the how he practiced and how everything happened in his life and how the he is giving the teaching how a great thing developed because of that if in that way also you can choose your deity and you can call them the second question is asking how can we remove our ego sanghita that is the another great process ego without ego the moment you become completely free from ego then you are with god only so that what is the god and the difference between god and us is only ego then ego is separating us from the god it is practice only you know constant practice and prayer so oh god i'm a fool that i don't don't know how to call you how to go to you can you please help me can you please help me by that way the did it slowly slowly we can be free from the ego so i think there is no friends let us offer our pradam to bhagavan's ramakrishna niranjanam [Music] is [Music]
