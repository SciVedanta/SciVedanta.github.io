[57. Panchama Veda 57: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GW21OKmSBM)

now we'll start with Pancham aveda terbuka Tom rhythm top TG venom kobe VI rhythm calm of Shaba homme Serena mangalam srimad artem boo bakunin de bourr√©e da jana kabhi jo krishna goswami or he was a very famous person is a as a call to hate the thousands of people is his follower now he is a young man and he used to come to ceramic ishness am Krishna stew like him very much and this bigger krishna goswami is asking a question sir why are rebound like this the discussion was going on now he is asking this question to see ramakrishna and the ceramic ishness answer is Maya it is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul this is a Maya the word ceramic ISNA used and we find it again and again in the Shankaracharya as explanation in a philosophy always you have to explain the Creator creation and the relation between the this too now this creation what is it actually is totally different from the Creator in that case what is going to happen so the people are mostly confused even the great philosophers do not get the proper answer some people are telling that this is nothing but God but one thing almost all the Philosopher's in all the religious religions they said God has created these world now the question is when you are creating you need two things one and intelligent agent the Creator another is the material now who is the intelligent agent Gaad and what is the material we're from the God got the material and some of the Philosopher's some of the religions they are not very clear about it but in the Hindu philosophy it is very clear we will come to that that point particularly but here we find that vagabond see Rama Krishna is telling it is Maya that is better to go through this so that it will be easy for us to understand now in Vedanta that is the end of the Veda in almost all the Vedas and the highest point of the Vedas Upanishads and they are the Veneti they always say God has created this universe out of his own now when the God is creating the universe out of its own the one question come now there is a lump of clay and the potter creating something out of that clay the potter is the intelligent agent clay is a matter material now in that Porter utilizing that lump of clay making a clay jar then the clay is no more but the jar is there so it is the transformation the material that clay has got the shape of an Arden jar are then part so the ship has been changed but that matter particularly the lump of clay is no more it has been exhausted it has been utilized and the person who has created the porter is totally out totally different from its creation so this is clear now one very famous philosopher of India the leader leader of the Mishnah Advaita philosophy basista special Advaita one philosophy ramanuja three ramanujacharya he is telling that this must be the cause and his the philosophy called paranormal bada pari na mo means transformation pari na ma transformation it was clay now it has become an Arden jar is a very interesting so this is perri nama the God has created this universe out of its own that God is the intelligent agent and also the material now the God is creating out of its own if we accept the purina moba the transformation the God has become Universal then there is no God the God is there but in different name different form different shape in the universe as a lump of clay exhausted and it became the our danger so that lump of clay is no more similarly the weakness of this philosophy is this christian the god is exhausted the answer has been given again in the veda none from the one if you are taking one poornima de una adam porna una muchacha teh porn hacia una magia una ebah aboushi shotty we know these very famous loca the out of the hole the complete has been taken away but still that complete still there so similarly now comes the philosophy of Shankar Acharya and his philosophy is named as be worth the bother appearance is not transformation appearance when you see that thousands of Sun is reflected on the waves of the sea thousands of Sun it is reflected but original sun is still there the similarly we see the god in every being but the original God is still there the God is creating these universe out of his own but not exhausted why whatever you see is nothing but the appearance now question comes why then we cannot see God that is what BJ krishna goswami is asking why can't you feel that we are God because now another Maya what is this Maya this a very simple word the two later word Maya but that gives the whole explanation of the chancre of Allah Xavi and what is this here again the Shankar Acharya says a built an army para Misha Shakti those who can understand the Indian language can understand a betta not back tia not explain nami for amisha Shakti is the power of the God on RD abadia eternal na rd it is no a beginning are the means beginning it is no beginning no one knows where when it began on RD Ovadia ignorance three gunas makarpura it has three qualities cetera je tamo three gunas makarpura it is the cause and how you understood it karjan mia by seeing the effect by seeing the work karyana Mia now we are taking a small pill and it is giving us a relief from the headache karyana me how it worked inside the body we do not know doctors maybe knowing the chemist maybe knowing scientist maybe knowing i do not know but I know that this small peel can help me why karjan who Mia by seeing the effect of it when you take the step of if it comes sudo Ava my eye on who understood is intellectual people very very intelligent people can understand these or otherwise it is very difficult because again another quality of Maya are Burana and big shape a verano means covering and big sheba means throwing something else over there so this we can understand is we can see this we can feel our Burana and big shaper its cover actual the real thing and then imposing on it something else in the desert most of the people they will be seeing one thing and they want that water in the desert it is dry and whatever the water they were carrying it is exhausted now this starts seeing me Roger they see that water is there not only see the waters they see the the trees the dead trees all around they see the camels they see the people to see the tins they see the whole thing and when they reach over there nothing is there except the same old sand his experience let's call me Raj and you always see the whole thing how could you because you wanted to see it because I wanted to see that particular scenery when I am thirsty when I'm hungry I want the support of the people i wanted to accommodation food water raised I project all my dream on something so this is the objective karyana me yeah it happens similarly I am seeing God goddesses everywhere but no opposite way I am throwing over that covering the actual thing here in the desert the person covered the plane the sand fulop's and a plot of land pull-ups and dry sand no water he covered that with his imagination and here we see the core in different form in different name they're all moving they're all stationed there everything I don't see God because again this Maya working in a different way I am covering that and imposing on that as a man oh man old child poor reach educated uneducated trees plans so many so many so many things I am projecting that is what shankara's argument so there it comes a burke tanami there is no name you cannot explain it and then paramecia shakti what is it is the power of God enardi it has no beginning OB DIA it is ignorance trigonometry cara cara janome Yasuda eva Maya yaya jagat suruba me dump rasoi from which the whole universe has been created is it really the universe has been created we say yes for us is real but for those who have reached over there nothing how see when you were children our world was different we never cared about the father war going on or the what the father is doing mother is doing all our neighbors relation neighbor we could think of that we were always very happy with some games because that is the nature that was our world and we could never think that I can part with a kite or a baseball bat or a football or something which you are so close to our hearts and now we cannot think of those what is all those things so that is the thing when i went to a gentleman's house his son is now learning to play the american football but he is a lean and thin villa tonight american photo leader to play as yes you see the pictures of the of the the the people who are playing and they are so stout first you have to become so stout otherwise and slowly i will grow up but you are stealing so that way he is thinking now afterwards the parents are also encouraging ok ok ok but when he will be graduating from the school level parents will say you have to become doctor you have to become engineer you have to become in scientists don't give much time on those things now concerned now afterwards he will be a doctor and treating those players that may be naturally we think something and we do something we become something all our world is totally go away so that is called my arm again the Shankar Acharya trying to explain it Raghavan see Ramakrishna say afterwards we'll come to that sinapi a sinapi biot meccano wonderfully and very ready mcquay he is giving us the explanation of maya which is impossible to give what is that Maya first he said in 108 sloka 108 sloka of the BBH Romany a better nominee para misa shakti enardi abita trig not makarpura carry on Amina su di bo Maya yah yah yah got sarvam idam press wotty today is the mahalia that means the alia the road is open and then the whole universe is now ready to receive the grace of the maha maya again is not only simple my mahama and in the trendy is the explaining in this way to emotionally shaktimaan anta birria bushna be shack team the power of vishnu and here it says para misha shakti shankaracharya styling and trendy is telling boys navy septum to arm bone abhishek team enanta birria vicious shabby geum paramus Amaya then some more heat on Davey samus tomita Twombly prasanna boovie mukti hey to Twombly prasanna boven aki ito no one can get the liberation from the bondage of these unless and until you bless and who is that paramecia shakti vishnu shakti and he is the bj medium is the root medium is the seed from where the whole universe is coming even though we are worshipping the personal goddess goddess Durga but we know the truth so that is why the Hinduism this is personal immediately becomes impersonal from impersonal it comes to us as a personal and we all right so many things about the god there was a very poor person who is to faydee in the river he was having a broken board somehow he was using that boat to come to go but he was a very good person used to go on praying to Goddess Durga so I have heard from the intelligent people honest people that if you take the name of Goddess Durga then all your flight all your miseries are going to be why to give me some money I am so poor I like to purchase a new board I like to help my family can't you give little money so he used to go and talking with Goddess Durga one day one lady came and she was standing on the one short and requesting this is sure a part a name those in a big already read they can understand ish sure apart any his name was ishara pattern means the boat man and he looked at that lady very nice looking lady and told what do you want I like to cross this river to give me little money and slitting a one Anna or something like that she told I am so poor I cannot give that oh my god i am also caught and i am doing this thing only for money now the only passenger that has come in the morning today and uses you and you cannot give me the money and you have even you are also poor but anyway what to do come i will give you it this cross this river help you she came she said then naturally they started questioning asking where from you are coming weasel is your husband the husband is not helping you then what is your father your father is not supporting you the father is he is in the Himalaya una i am going to evenly and my husband don't talk about him he's all the time smoking the him and lying down like that and punch em okay kokuhaku cooks of the means veda the punchy punchy means five mukha means face it is shiva punjon anna the shiva is having the five enana the face and in that faces goes on speaking about the for Veda and a gamma nu gamma etc contoh vara wish and cable amar shangguan the hornies see is a full of he up to his throat is only the venom Shiva that is why she was going on giving the hints that she is not ordinary and she is the Parvati herself but the poor man couldn't understand that oh my god your husband is not good like that he was showing the sympathy then when that lady went away if he came once again to his boat and saw the portion where she was sitting and the particularly the place where he put her leg has become gold the half of the board has become golden so that way the god is so how see she came herself but the poor fellow couldn't understand she is goddess Durga self why Maya what type of Maya the way she explained and talk like this so this is Sun appears on a boy at meccano here the Shankar Acharya stealing this is neither real naughty unreal when the Maya means unreal know how can I see unreal I can go and touch it the horse I can go and get the milk from a cow I can see my neighbor and these and that everything I can feel how can I say it is unreal when there is a toothache all this began to will vanish is this so painful so I'm god forbid no one should have that experience but the thing is wind that is that you can understand so when you say oh this whole area this whole universe the world is nothing but my illusionary I cannot say it is illusory so the Shankara says neither real nor unreal and also again at the same time you cannot say the both are not their real unreal is there Boyd no it is not void look at it the philosophy it's not void you cannot say that nothing is there it is there but at the same time it is not there again it is telling banoffee avi na p why out meccano is it separated veena veena mean separate is it separated No hanafi is attached no then what both asanga p sangavi Assange gopi viet meccano then he said Mahad butta butta means wonder Mohammed Buddha is impossible to explain O'Neill bacione aruba button means the words you cannot explain it through the words but it is there and this is called Maya Raghavan cinema Krishna in a very simple way he is telling Maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul the soul is their God is their that eternal reality is there but over that there's a cover and for that this problem what is that ego I I everybody is telling I I and you ask what is I nobody knows no one can explain that is I what is I this body this mind nothing then what but still I is so strong is so difficult so Maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul that means soul is there Paramatma that is there the totality of the whole soul at the same time ji vaar ma that the reflection still there in a brimming that is the adroit Vedanta then Maya that his ego is like it cloud but once I Ramakrishna is again and again repeating ego is easy to understand for us Shankara told something is difficult to understand conceive see Ramakrishna is more easy to understand ego we know what is ego and here it is Lamaya that his ego is like it cloud now the ego is this much and God is everywhere how can the ego block the vision of God to naturally is a very good question salam o Krishna answering they like a patch of cloud a small patch no comparison in the size of the Sun Sun is so big but still we cannot see the huge Sun because of a patch of cloud similarly because it is covering your site in such a way you cannot see the Sun the similarly God is everywhere it is huge but still you cannot see God because of small patch of ego the jiva is nothing but embodiment of sachidananda such cheat on and the zaruba such means it is existence cheat knowledge Ananda bleeze eternal now these when you read this really appreciating the way they are utilizing using the words bliss eternal why the moment you say Ananda when we go and see some game we feel joy excited but afterwards when you come out that goes away when you are eating when you are meeting a frame so this type of joy the under we always it experience but after some time it is gone so once again once again once again so in the society what they do they go on creating some functions if there is no function when the function counts people are all excited they will come in every society there is a big function in India the Syrah and this Durga Puja all over the india all the people now they'll be all good dresses good food everybody is good even the political parties are also becoming quiet because they have to go along with their families all the leaders will be fighting all through the year at least these seven days they are taking break so like that everybody is happy it is necessary so afterwards again the same old life will come no once you realize the sachidananda eternal please eternal your joy will be continuous unbroken so that he is telling satyananda Jeeva is nothing but embodiment of embodiment the figure can you imagine when all the people are pointing fingering out and telling you were a senior you were a senior you were a sinner here the Vedanta says you are the embodiment of such Iran and the embodiment of God but Maya the ego created various Oh bodies Oh body means attributes now he has forgotten his real self attributes I mean man is a woman is it the days is that all attributes and this attributes that is creating the problem wherever you go that attributes goes ceramic ISNA will be explaining but how the creation came madondo always goes along with a philosophy that's called purusa and prakruti from there it has been purusa means consciousness and from the purusha prakruti comes Prakriti means again that power is that is why the gods power is prakruthi is different now a person and is capability he has the knowledge he has the capacity to do that too but now as if he is making that at two different personalities one is intelligent but inactive another is active with the power of the intelligent the purusha is one but the creating a James are meaning that's called prakruthi the purusa and prakruti fiscal samkhya philosophy samkhya means knowledge the samkhya village our philosophy and from the Prakriti comes marked the cosmic intellect now whatever we try to do we first think unless we think properly if the planning is perfect the everything is perfect if the planning is wrong you cannot make up will be something wrong so that is why in the Western world we find materialistically they are very perfect why planning is perfect whenever they are constructing a road they think about the 50 years afterwards how many vehicles will ply with that how many people will use so 50 words 50 years they are planning so when the road is going both the side they will occupy they will keep like that and then as the demand is coming they will go on expanding but in the Eastern countries as because we never did of ourselves somebody thought for us so now even we are confused so we do something then we bite our fingers or we made a mistake I saw in ashram I saw they have made an approach road for a bridge that will cross a big river Brahmaputra huge River so you can understand the approach road from where they are bringing the long approach road they have everything completed then the engineer came and told no bridge cannot be built over here the whole approach road is like that millions of that money is still there but who actually was planning without planning the bridge the prep approach road was made it is like without making anything they made a staircase and after going on the top of the staircase they decided no building is necessary then what the staircase will do similarly all our plan if you go and see all our money in so many ways it is totally wasted so that is the first thing so prakruti is wonderful planning that that's why the first thing that he is doing prakruthi is doing is a cosmic intellect moth from the mod comes untuk karana cosmic ego intellect is there it has the planning but we will do and those people who are doing in the action those people who in the action the little rough and tough so if you go and see in the offices the officers are so nice gentle very car tears because they are sitting inside the air-conditioned room everything is neat and clean but they are the managers of the cold field now they are all planning everything now the people who are working inside the cold field if you go and talk to them they are rough they are tough because that is ego unless that they won't be able to work so similarly in the cosmic creation also the purusha we do not know where it is but it gives all the energy to something that is called prakruthi there is also very certain from there the intellect comes mothe then comes cosmic ego let's call untuk corona and from the antic Iran again mana there's a mine then puncher organ fight Saints organs and five action organs fightin matra and then maha bua puncher ma'buta shitty Appa ta maruta boom on say we are now here we are standing over here shitty Appa teacher but then we have to climb over and we have to reach up to the purusha is called 24 stages of creation and this is bhagawan sri ramakrishna stealing we are sachidananda that purusha is coming down up to this now we have to go back mon jolla new journey katani oh my mind let us go back to our own aboard what is that such as ananda unless and until the human being reaches over there the human being is not satisfied so see Rama Krishna is talking with vijay krishna goswami and he is telling you know that attributes that is creating problem even the money is attribute and then he is telling money is also a greater body as attribute the position of money makes such a difference in a man he is no longer the same person then he gives an explanation a frog had a rupee which he kept in his hole one day an elephant was going over the hole and the frog coming out of the feet coming out in a fit of anger raised his foot as if to kick the elephant the frog us trying to kick the elephant and said how dare you walk over my head such is the pride of money when you are having the money immediately everything is changed one can get rid of ego after attaining knowledge one can get rid of ego after attaining knowledge on attaining knowledge one goes into Samadhi and the ego disappears but it is very difficult to obtain such a knowledge so the key is telling knowledge at the symptom is talking about Samadhi Samadhi is yoga the patanjali yoga darshan that we are reading now and in every Sunday there we have completed the chapter Samadhi now we have began with the southern path how to do that but the Samadhi we know saba culpa nesba culpa Samadhi nothing is there even though I consciousness also not present and there when you reach and you know who really you are and then all this illusion goes that is called knowledge and knowledge is oneness knowledge can never become too it is all one the moment I see that I have become all these things naturally I never hate whom to hit it is all myself so that is called knowledge so here see ramakrishna stealing and it is possible to reach over there and he says in the bathr that man experiences samadhi when his mind ascends to the seventh plane there are seven planes and again in the yoga sutra it says that mooladhara then come swadisthana Moni poor Anahata be shoed Agra chakra then sahasrara and shahara on the top of the head is called seventh plane in the human body itself it begins with the beginning of our the spinal cord at the end of the spinal cord that's called mula Adara a thorough means the container a mullah means the real root the root is that the container is that mooladhara from there it is travelling and cinema Krishna is explained explaining where does the mind of an ordinary dwell in the first three plane that is malad are shoddy Stan money pool that means up to never level that's why constantly physical thoughts all the time roaming centering the physical body they can never overcome that they cannot think of anything else except those things then the mind is emerged only in worldliness a man attached to her this a man sees the light of God when the mind dwells in the plane of the heart and that is called anata the heart that particular lotus is named as on Arthur and when the mind is there he is the light of God and then come and then he says ha what is these what is these next the plane commas on the throat and that throat is called a gotcha kragh wyndham we shoot the I wish you'd the chakra when the mind dwells there he likes to hear the talk only of God and then when the mind ascends to the next plane in the forehead between the eyebrow it is called agha chakra he sees the form of the Shechinah nanda then finally when it goes to the seventh plane when the mind reaches the seventh plane then the ego vanishes completely and the man goes into Samadhi that that is how he is explaining the bj uh what does a man see when he attains the knowledge of Brahman is a very tricky question and Bhagavan see Rama Krishna is telling what happens when the mind reaches the seventh plane cannot be described once a boat enters into the black waters of the ocean it does not return that means the ocean is so big is very very they never go to the black water the boat all the small the fishing boats they are all kneel now the huge big ships they go but in those days they ceramic is time of ceramic ISNA is explaining then again he is giving an excellent example once assault doll when to measure the depth of the ocean no sooner did it entered the water then it melted now who could tell how deep the ocean was because the doll was made of salt and salt actual made of water of the ocean now that this doll made of salt when to measure the what in the ocean and it became the ocean itself how it will come and see the eye that makes one a worldly person is the wicked I cinema Krishna that is a very excellent a unique of ceramic ISNA let's go catch ami bacha me in Bengali gotcha means unripened here shoma nicola nicki lon and the GS translated we could I unripe we could I why the wicked I because of the ego because it is away from God then now what is this wicked I it is the ego that says what don't they know me be joy if without destroying the eye a man cannot get rid of attachment to the world and consequently cannot experience Samadhi then it would be wise for him to follow the path of Brahma Fionna to attain samadhi if the i persist in the path of devotion then I one should not rather choose the path of knowledge here the master says it is true that one or two can get rid of the eye through Samadhi but these cases are very rare through the part of Samadhi eradicate the eye it is very very there and then he is telling that o God thou are the master I am thy servant this I will not harm you therefore if I must remain let that remain as the servant I as long as you leave you should say o God thou art the master and I am thy servant so how to realize God how to realize cell how to attain Samadhi just by eradicating I the lower I the unripe I that is wicked I which always attached with ego how we can mold at eagle by giving it to God I am the servant of god I am the child of god and that pride will not bind the path of knowledge is very difficult one cannot obtain knowledge unless one gates leader the feeling that one is the body that body consciousness should go and it is impossible in the Kali Yuga the life of man is centered and food he cannot get rid of the feeling that he is the body and the ego therefore the path of devotion is prescribed for the cycle see Ramakrishna is very clear about this now this is kali yuga in these we can see everywhere is nothing but the ego ego means attached to this body and with this body that means we need everything and with that mind one cannot practice gianna yoga and that is why it is very easy to practice bhakti-yoga so that is why wherever it here some people will be there who can practice gana yoga but it is easy to practice bhakti-yoga this is an easy path you will attain God if you sing his name and glories and pray to him with a longing heart very simple pray to Him and sing his name take his name constantly there is not the least doubt about it there is no doubt about it who is telling it raghavan the God Himself suppose you draw a line on the surface of water with a bamboo stick the water appears to be divided into two parts but the line doesn't remain for any length of time similarly the servant I or the devotee I the child I is only a line drawn with the ego and it is not real be joy to the master said you asked us to renounce the wicked I is there any harm with the solvent I that means I is there now the wicked I means I with a test with ego when I am becoming the servant of the child or the devotee that is also ego and is it there that is harmful then the master salam o Krishna is answering the servant I that is the feeling I am the servant of god i am the devotee of God does not injure one on the contrary it helps want to realize God see that is the reason when a person attached with the astana or temple or the holy place should be very humble why other people are coming they are not aware of it we need not to all the time compare with them those who are dedicated they should always remember I am the servant of God and the servant has no authority to say no to anyone but has the authority to look after all the thing of the master if anyone is bringing something immediately that has to be offered to the master whether he will accept it or not it's up to him any person is coming but of course there is a timing within that stipulated time which is coming ok surely you can go whether you belong to my religion whether you believe in my god whether you speak in my language whether you eat what I eat no question should be there so this is the first criteria of a devotee who is dedicated to God because the eye of the devotee is eradicated by dedicating the same thing at the feet of the Lord how then you can say no to anyone we ever comes one British officer came to the balloon mod in a very old days they were not habituated and to remove the shoe and he was the officer was going to that shrine which was offered sharma vivek on the himself over that sweet now he called old sighing abella wat with the shirts on chardon on the g stopped him and without asking you remove your show not like that he said let me help you to remove your shoe look at it sorrow done and the g and the heat or let me help you to remove your shoe and he sat down and he removed they helped him to remove the shoe so that one incident tell us how the things should go those who are attached with the astana how humble they should be how polite they should be how alert they should be all the time I cannot allow people coming with the shoe inside the temple but at the same time we should not be hard that is the training with that training what you are getting the benefit you are actually removing their ego which is the hindrance to realize your own self to realize God you are not becoming low you are not becoming small brother you are becoming holy and pure because you will be Blissett so that is the training but unfortunately this is why I always say punch em aveda we read me that one person wrote i am reading beta this is good where the what you'll understand so this way the means this knowledge the knowledge which will help you to understand how to realize god help you to prepare yourself to realize god of course if you are interested or otherwise it doesn't go with you it is not for you so this is what see Rama Krishna is telling that the servant I that is the feeling I am the servant of god i am the devotee of God does not injure one on the contrary it helps want to realize God today after this and in the next week again you will
