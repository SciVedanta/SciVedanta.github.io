[23.Panchama Veda 23: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RT7bribz84)

you and the pedometer when they have added that is a piranha Krishna a disciple of ceramic resna a devotee of sri ramakrishna in his house salam krishna came it was second april' 1882 here he is talking about the God wherever he went he talked about God only in different to a different fashions in different words and here people are waiting what see Ramakrishna will say on that to listen to that they are all settings see Ramakrishna today's Ramakrishna has come to Calcutta he is sitting with the devotees in the border on the first floor of piranha krishna mukerji SH shampoo core house shampoo cool is a bug baja shampoo cool Shamburger there's all North Calcutta they say mainly people this to leave over there very educated cultured rich people is to leave over there ceramic ish news too frequently visit these places to meet the people having just eaten a meal with the devotees it is Sunday second april' 1882 the 14th day of the bright fortnight objector the time between one and two in the afternoon look at how master Masha is giving the account of everything in details so that one can first thing is historical second one can meditate on it many of the play show me's many of the people devotees they'll be reading a little portion of the Cathari the gospel and then they will be meditating on that how they can meditate they're transporting themselves to that party cooler time and the situation when see ramakrishna sitting and talking and this type of timing place position that helps us to meditate here one or two afternoon captain leaves in the same neighborhood and Haku wants to go to his house after resting at pranna Krishna's then he wants to visit cash option in his house called the lily cottage look at it how much troubles salam o Krishna is taking he has come to devotees house meeting they're talking to the people this is called missionary I realize God in a secluded place I then you don't talk about the god I don't care about the people who are suffering it is their own Karma this is a one type of theory this thing Raghavan has come to establish religion how that we will see we have already noticed removing the ignorance about religion removing the ignorance about God that is the way bhagavan sri ramakrishna this time dava tada he stabbed listen religion he has come he has taken food along with the devotees now it is one or two no rest again devotees have come now he is talking from there he will go to captain's house then to another person keshavjee under Shane's house then only return the whole day he is visiting like this he wants to kick off Shane and Lily cottage Braun Krishna sitting in his parlor rahman Aman kada Srinagar Indra Rock Hall Balarama aim other devotees are present he is not giving all the names so many devotees dish to come some gentlemen of the neighborhood and other invited guests are also there they are all anxious to hear what Taku has to say wherever we go the some devotee will be inviting for a cup of tea or you always say invite others the neighborhood people so that they will come over there and can get the opportunity I also can talk to them and so our sean is they are always like that wherever we go one object to spread the message of Allah Raghavan himself started that Taku Raghavan salam Krishna's telling God and His glory this world is certainly his glory but seeing his splendor and glory people forget everything else they don't look for him who is the master of this reaches everybody wants to join enjoy lost end goal but there are more problems than enjoyment the world is like a whirlpool of the shock she in Bengali it says mashaallah Keith dog mashaallah keep da da means the report once aboard boat is courting it nothing can save it I don't know how many of you have seen that the water is going down whirlpool taking everything down like the black hole we heard about similar thing is taking inside an ER ever ganga sometimes it happened one of our imagery he fell in that it was so difficult it's so difficult once a boat is caught in it nothing can save it all just like thorny bush you pull yourself out of one tall and get entangled with another it's so difficult to be in the house already constantly one after another I think I mentioned about one young boy who don't like to marry but his because he's the only child his mother is insisting he lost his father in his young age so mother is thinking naturally all mothers things like that what will happen to my son after me who will take care of him so naturally she is ready to marry him now he's orient he don't like to man why he is telling the same thing he was telling I know the after marriage it is responsible it will come now I am only looking after my mother now the girl that they are bringing the relation all that she is also having hot parents so I'll have to take the responsibility of those two then then 1111 it should be like this but I don't like want to be entangled in that so just like the thorny bush one after another it will go on coming you cannot go out of it for home run business telling those who have the desire to become spiritual so one should not make any mistake that those who have the desire to be in the world householders life there is no problem but only those want to be free from the bondages for them only say Ramakrishna's mentioning the ones you were entangled in it there is no other way to go out then once you are once you enter in a levee rint leverage the Gulag father this labyrinth it's difficult to find out the way out of it a man becomes cost in the world of last and gold so this is the picture that he is giving us a very gloomy picture for those he is giving the correct picture so that he can understand in the world life is like this so if you accept you have to accept it all these defects also those who want to be liberated now we find the same thing the God and His glory it is this world is his glory and it is everything is so nice so tempting here eat on beauty you gamja mama yobt tatata in bhagavad-gita tenth chapter 7 sloka bhagavan sri krishna is telling he who knows the truth about this manifestation of my divine Majesties and about my power all that you see is only I have created why so that your mind get an examination is examination is nothing else all the temptations will be there but we should not be tempted and we have to go so we will see the how people are asking question and ceramic asian is giving the answer it on beeboo theme you gum chew mama you pity tatata all these things are also creation of God everything that we see is nothing but the creation of god if god has created why should he not take that is wrong you have got the opportunity God has created the teacher God has created the books God has created the classroom and God is giving through the mouth of the teacher the good words but God has created the bad things also now God is the air sitting over as a student it is the student up to judge so this is why God is doing like this it is his game disease play afterwards we'll hear from see ramakrishna the same God he was lying added pretending to be sleeping and two person approached one is Arjuna another is enduro Johanna and both of them invited him then he said look I will I am having only two things myself and my very highly trained soldiers in one side it is only me and other side all the thousands of soldiers now you are here to invite me for the war I give you option first he said to the arjuna what do you want me alone that too I won't pick up any or I won't fight and then second is so when it trained soldiers this is the examination God is constantly putting before us why solanki schnauzer it is his play it is his game he likes it he has given the discriminative Faculty he has given the booty he has instructed you now if you don't apply those things you have to suffer dujana suffered why he was tempted with the gods creation not the God Himself if you take the creation it likes this but if you take the God Himself that is the thing its Ramakrishna is telling then a devotee is asking so what is the way out look at these wonderful questions that is the beauty of the gospel of Salem Krishna when we read a scripture we only hear good words but here's a Ramakrishna a person he is not only we giving the ideology at the same time explaining it and we can feel it and understand it is so easy it is our everyday experience so what is the way out you have to be a Brahmin you have to be a Hindu you have to be born in India you have to be 18 Ganga is he telling like that nothing like what he said only two words that we have already heard from him he'll be telling slowly slowly in the first day when he made master Masha he said at a time for things and today slowly slowly stealing their otherwise devotees will be scared the people know so many things we have to do they do so many things they'll be doing but for realization of God but to get the piece but to get the eternal life nobody wants to do any work so that's why I Ramakrishna said there is we holy company and prayer very simple holy company and prayer these are the two words but again and again he is tracing wheel here we'll find him all through the book holy company why that is the problem in the name of religion people everyone will be giving you so many doctrines and dogmas and so many explanations they know how to go home to accept and ceramic Krishna is telling holy company means the person who has lived up to that I do not what is that ideology we will see afterwards what are those things he is telling only holy company and prayer unless you go to the doctor you cannot be cured why he is telling about the holy company he is giving an example you have to cure your disease some problem then whom if you go to a poet and say I am having some headache can you please then the poet me again recite one of his own composition that will increase your head it more and that is the way but you have to go to a doctor only and doctor knows what to give what not to give how to give etc so you have to and for the realization of God you have to go go to the only person here the he is telling holy person means who has already realized because already realized God and then only this person can tell you because he has the full experience than knowledge only otherwise it will be the great difficulty great problem so again and again he is telling the holy company unless you go to a doctor you can't be cured one day of holy company is not enough only one day we will be going in our country they'll all love our Gandhiji and only once in a year they will remember condition that they all they'll be wearing the handmade dresses and cap like the Gandhiji and they will be sitting and doing some Chaka and all that bus over and out of 365 days only one day and all the days will be wearing all other things this is hypocrisy that one too only once in a while I go to the temple and then I pray O God either and then we'll be burning one or two candles and come out bus I went to God that under is it transformation we have to again and again you that that what is ritual life is the transformation I go to a market I go to a shop I purchase something I choose something it is not like this I have to transform myself only once I go and visit and I here or just see and immediately idol and decide oh this is like this note is not you have to go regularly and slowly slowly you can understand how it comes is always necessary because the disease is chronic the chronic disease it is or the old disease it cannot be rectified so easily you have to go to the doctor and doctor means holy company and what will happen how is Willie company useful the person is asking see it is good Christian cos asking it is good that he has already asked so and it is good that master mache recorded so you are getting this answer fast is the piece is the problem of the life now the question is do you want to realize God do you want eternal life do you want peace in your life okay then the question is so what is the way out then answer holy company and prayer again the question is how is holy company useful you are asking for the holy company suppose I go how it is usefull association of the Holy devil foreign names for God ceramic is nesting association with the Holy develops fondness for God and then it generates love for him unless you can develop yearning for the god you won't achieve anything then three things when you go to a holy company what happens you develop fondness about God who is God what he has done how we can so slowly because we are not seeing God so when we are going to a person when you see him simplicity and all the just is a very highly intelligent person but a childlike behavior and you're so simple not at all careful about himself unselfish constantly thinking about others praying for them slowly slowly when you go when you see we develop oh if this person is like this then it must be how the God will be it is so good so that we develop fast idea of God and attachment and love for God is the foreignness we make one mystic always why because I the ego because of our code some of the traditions in our society that is also there we develop the person whom I am meeting attachment with the person wrong attachment with the person will bring misery but the love for the ideology will only bring peace the person through whom I am going good I must be respectful always all through my life I must remember that's called guru but guru should we transform it to God that skull broadness so guru Marge's in the Eastern always in every always in our at least the system the guru means you will be marching in the eastern the tenth guru the some guru of our organization breshwahr Ananda ji Maharaj he instructed not to inform his date of birth before his death don't tell any date of birth because immediately people will be because the weakness the people immediately whom he is seeing immediately start loving game attachment to him but how far it's not possible who can be guru only God can be good that's why I Ramakrishna again and again he is telling the moment I hear the word guru all my hairs stand on end because the guru means God and in our instructions you will find always guru bringing you near to the god that's called Easter system is your own and then guru marches in the Eastern so guru and he start the same its Margie so I have the respect for the person bad only that person and nobody else again the problem so that is there so ideologically we had to love salam o Krishna is stealing unless you go to a holy person you cannot and when you go to holy person what happened you first develop Oh No raga in San skate in Bengali in Indian language is called on rock owner that means a likeness started liking and some people will be going to the Krishna they like the way of Krishna they lived and all some will go to the Rama some will go to some other places so where they love lived so I like it so anuradha then comes love the love means is a one way I don't expect anything but I like to give that's called love it's a mother's love for her child the mother is not asking anything from the child but wants to give everything and sticking care of everything that is called mahalo Varsha let's call love so after the fondness it's gone come love then comes we doubt you I cannot leave here owning and that is why the bush neighbors they have depicted the whole this thing in the personality of raha what is rather not only you just we are thinking that is she's a lady and not like that this owner Agha then valobasha then Baku lata back home it cannot leave without God every moment every moment it is there that condition win comes then only how it comes first begins with the holy company when the people are coming to see Ramakrishna be this to see how used to cry for mother one of our show me the direct disciple of Saddam o Krishna you always like to keep that little remove so that you can see those the great souls sitting over there Serrano Krishna's disciple did themselves each and every one of them are highly spiritual Giants but at the same they gave everything for bhagwan cinema Krishna that is the beauty of those people 16 of them so here why one of them he was passing through one place I think in Rajasthan where he found that one young man is singing a love song about him there was a lady standing on the branda and just he is singing to tell her that I fond of you I cannot remain without you exit exit to the labs on this show me started crying then people said why you are crying then he said you know how i'm leaving i don't know why should i leave i haven't aku has left us for such a long time ago and i am such a fool i cannot think of him i'm leaving i am eating and roaming why should I my God my love my soul everything is gonna be he was yearning for Saddam Krishna a little the moment they will be telling this is the beauty immediately then another show me also some people they were expressing you see the beauty of the nature how the Sun is rising how the moon is rising are this beauty of the ocean beauty of the yields beauty of the jungles immediately he'll be telling think of the person who has created it this is all nature's beauty but who has created the nature think of him so this is called shadow Sangha every moment day everything they will be taking to that that in him in the Indian music classical musical with link swim so means after all this again they will come to the is consumed so do you for everything they will go to God so that is the beauty what happens after sadhu sanga this happens we try to develop to understand God develop love for God so this is the with Ramakrishna he has taken all the devotees to the museum they are going he saw the human skeleton he told see this is the human body and all people in the world they will be carrying so much for the human body what is their only few bones and over the bone there will be some mass and there will be some scheme and you love this so much think of it see he has granted the museum but it will be bringing to God so God is the only thing not this body whatever we be the beauty of this body one date is going to go it will deteriorate so love the so lonely gourd only he saw the lion in the Jew immediately he remembered Goddess Durga lion and broken because the mother goddess Durga the carrier of the guys the lion immediately it's not the lion and all this he looked the mind to the goddess Durga that is the beauty of the shadows that is the beauty of the Holy company that is the speciality of the Holy company me everything they will be taking the mind to the God he went to the circus that the lady was walking on the sting the row you look at it how the BB the lady she is walking at ease on his row only because he has practiced so if you have to control the mind you have to practice practice practice this is the sadhu sanga so here see Rama Krishna is telling fast if you go association with the Holy develop fondness then generates lab and then yearning for the God by keeping the company of the holy people the heart become restless for God it is like feeling constantly OD when somebody at home is in worrying how the patient can be cured he is giving the example that I love someone and his ela she's healed how much I think I am doing everything but at the same time my mind is there how is he how is she like this then again he's telling there is another way praying with sincere heart first is going to the shot shots angle is a holy company second Steve hey stealing praying with prayer is the pack away prarthana with sincere heart he is your own you have to say to him please reveal yourself to me grant me your vision why have you given birth to me this is the claim to the car this is the beauty of prayer and when we are praying we are always afraid and some people they think that unless you are chanting the name of God you cannot play not always chanting means when you were chanting the name of God if you can understand the meaning of it that naturally a good thought comes in the mind and it remains for a long time like the Bhagavad Gita or the bhagavata or the Vedanta if you understand the meaning of you simply chanting on to just because just like a song they'll be singing some of the signals are there will be singing in different languages but they write that in their own language and they know the tune so they were seeing everybody is so happy oh she can sing in Bengali she can sing in Asami's she can sing in Hindi but she doesn't understand the meaning of it what she is singing so obviously the song is not affecting harmine the singers mind so you unless in until you know the meaning of it so prarthana the prayer means knowing the meaning of it and how can i pray when I know that he's my own I can breathe I can give the pressure of him that way why you should not rebuild that yourself to me sheiks devotees said to me that God is kind I said to them why should I call in kind look at it so we always say God is kind he is merciful Solana Lucas instilling why should I say like that he has created us what wonder is there the he is kind to us the father should always be kind to the Sun to children obvious why should I have to well every time say thank you thank you thank you i know that i love and father also understand that i am loving so this way a relation is so close that you need not to express every time with the world the moment you say with the world it uses the weight so that is the love is internal it is a mind that likes then again when a boy in treats his mother for money mother I fall at your feet please give me money mother has to comply with his wishes seeing his insistence she toss a few coins at him he is teaching how to bring when you have developed the relation with God when you have developed the faith and believe in God when you are sure that God is existing God is there then just like that he is my horn he is listening to me go and pray to God I need these I need that you have to do this you must do that like this like that you have to argue then only God will listen that skull prayer is it not good it's not beautiful country pray all the time shall you have to bathe in a holy water and then put on the washed clothes then only will see it on its seat and then only pray why should we every time every moment we have to pray pray pray and pray so that is the beauty to see Rama Krishna is telling holy company volley company what happens I develop fondness for God love for God then prayer card there is another benefit with the company of the Holy what's that only the thought of what is real comes in mind what is real comes in mind all these things suck assertive each other so it is the duty and the responsibility of the holy people those what trying to be holy when the people have come to them to tell them the truth to inspire them to love God to inspire them to leave a very holy life that is their responsibility it's not to take the benefit of the people who are coming over there it is very very wrong I have seen in the cali mundi the some people will be there constantly the puja is I took one gentleman is a rich man he brought so much about money to distribute among the people and you know that his that by seeing him people could understand his rich family so when he entered I took him to the Kali temple immediately all the pandas they call pandas and they come come sir come over here then i will show you see this is the fate of Goddess Kali he removed the flowers and showed and then you touch it and give 1000 rupees and any say this is the hand of God you touch it and give another 1000 rupees now if you promise that I will give this much money to purchase a shoddy for mother it will be so good for you I was wondering why this man is cheating this man has come far away from a country with so much faith that I will pray to goddess Kali he has the failed now this person every day every moment he is worshipping the goddess is living in the temple he has lost the faith and that is why since he has lost the faith in goddess Kali though he is worshipping goddess Kali he can in front of the goddess cheek another person by telling like that so this is not that since you are leaving in the temple he will get all the benefit no rather sometimes when you are coming in too much of closeness that also creates problem to lose the faith so that is why we must be very very practical and how we can do it there are some of the rules are there which a monastic they follow the difficulty is we don't have a monastic company over here the one person just wearing a galois sometimes the Western trace also so it is difficult to understand the monastic way of life but if you go to the place is the source the India or you'll see the more tanned mission you will find how the things are going on that is their way of life and that way they have to develop only because they're only thing in their life is God realization so obviously they cannot make any adjustment it is not possible one there is another group driscoll pooja is the warship hurts but that is their profession indeed pujari deepu to house to house they perform the poojas and against that they get some money they get some things so that they can maintain their family there's another group there are also religious people and these there are third type of people they will be muggin up so much of things and they'll be explaining things they'll be chanting the whole Scripture there's a third group but they leave a household is life so this is the third group fourth group is the devotees so they are leaving householders like all the responsibilities and at the same time em high moral life to the four stages problem is the religion are monastics because they don't go to the people's houses didn't mix with them so much they are not supposed to so obviously the fourth group cannot understand the first clue they understand the second and third clearly not the first group so that's why some time there is mystics there's misunderstandings so we have to why I'm telling this because you are our devotees you are coming to ours so you have to understand if you read the holy mother's life hard conversation you would see one lady was passing and as the bengali ladies the indian ladies will be wearing the shoddy that's the end of the shoddy it touched the Ramachari who was sitting at the corner of the veranda mother was there mashallah domani devi and this lady was passing a young Ramachari the clock touched the body this lady never cared she just went away the young man what is there I have my son I have my grandson in our houses what is there immediately mother called that lady you coming here go and break to him he's a brahmacari you should not touch her touching look at it this is the way of the monastics unless we read these we won't be able to understand so when see ramakrishna is talking he's giving a general instructions because he is in the heart among the householders he is trying to improve their morality but when a person becomes a monk he's supposed to be highly moral already now it is the last lap that he's running he's supposed to be so he's way of thinking he is a way of dealing his way of moving everything is totally different tied so these if you understand then you can appreciate so this is he is telling the another benefit shot or sharp the beach are in the benefit of the Holy company the thought of what is real comes to mind what is real what is eternal that is God and what is unreal it is transitory the mind should discriminate no sooner does an elephant raise its trunk to eat the plant entry of a stranger but the mahout go sit then in the mind there are so many desires are there one gentleman told we will invite all the monks in a hotel everything will be glittering and the well-dressed people will be coming and serving there will be music I to what for that is the life that some people they like very much in the company of the rich and powerful and in the glittering situation people are serving and very costly hottie that is a life some people like that is okay not for us we don't go to the hotel for that we go for something totally different purpose so that type of why these differences because of the thinking capacity what what i will do with that some people are over sitting over there they are powerful in the politically powerful what i am going to do with that i don't have any connections with all this my connections with the people dharma pollen terumah shiksha that is the only two things for a monastic life mom's life sannyasins life Dharma pollen calma shiksha the more you are involved the more the problems in the life of the monastics you see so many hundreds there are falling from the ideology why because they could not keep it up it's not so easy so it's so difficult say why there is seen this person is asking why do you seen then this questions also was axed by Arjuna he said Otto ho kina Peduto IAM poppin charity purusa an itchin opie varshney baladi bunny hijita forcefully something someone dragging my mind to do something wrong sinful thing balada Vanya the wife what is that prompted by reach a man is forced to indulgence scene then in reply shri krishna wonderfully he said only two words nobody is your enemy only fewer your mind you thought is your enemy gamma Asia croda Asia Raju gonna see would Bubba mahesana maha Padma buildin abide enum some places the code Shankar Acharya then what is the door of hell naari the women the tour of hell naw Dee women how can that be now it is your desire is your desire only that's why see Ramakrishna he went when he came he accepted the friction of the past as a Brahmin he accepted the gift from a low caste lady is so called locust and gives you so much respect to her so that is away should it be steep we find a salam o Krishna Vivekananda they are giving a new shape to Hinduism in the name of Hinduism so many things came now it is very very wrong so it is your desire one person he was used to hate the women he became a monk and then he started hating the women then this maha purusha mara said why you were hating heading means constantly remembering them as a Ravana he hated the Rama and he was remembering him constantly every moment you are also know here we had mother we had antes we had so many relations we in our own home they're like us only to see the Drishti bungay as they called you have to change how it can come from Assad who Sangha otherwise it is impossible you will never develop it is very peculiar you can never develop it so this is the way so one person was telling he was taking me he said sharmaji there is a gambling house huge will please go inside and simply hold the one rod and bring it down for me at all I know that that is gambling if you think that as because you are driving me so you cannot enter into him thank you you just drop you over here I will hire a taxi and go you go and play I don't have any objection you need not to Bly's me you can go and play that but I will never do that whatever money comes you can take with you what you are talking about you don't have any idea about us so this is the problem why he is a good man a religious person and he said that every day morning I worship God then only I come out everything is there no idea about the monastic life so this is the thing that we have to understand if you like you can go gamma Asia Croatia Roger gonna summit Papa it is the last it is the hangar is it tremendous desire a nun unfulfilled desire means anger so these two things always behind every sin if you analyze you will always find Sosa Ramakrishna is categorically telling this is the beauty a lot of things they will be telling and then they will publish a book not like that for the betterment of the true spiritual seekers plain thing if you accept is good for you if you don't accept us up to you then see I'm so seenus is or is not responsible for his teens see I'm dissing a gentleman is stealing the neighbor there are all kinds of people in this world ramkrishna is telling all kinds of people in this world he has created good people he has also created the weekend it is he who gives good as well as bad tendencies see he in bhagavad-gita again in the 10 chapter 4 and 5 slokas vivanta ba-ba-boo tanem Mukti Britta beha from me only different type of tendencies have come this is the speciality of Hinduism we're from these bad things came the semitic religions they could not answer properly so they said there's another force is their name Saturn and from that only everything is coming wrong is all coming from the one only from the god all these divers mode of minds seen in all beings proceed from me so that's when see Ramakrishna said if you are not going to a holy person if you are not getting the holy company regularly you can never understand some people will be reading books and we will develop a conception of Doak only according to his theory his condition mental attitude that is not so you have to go to the real people who are leaving life in that unselfish people here salam o Krishna is telling the person is telling if it is so God has created good and bad so it is not our responsibility so a sinner is not responsible for it scenes salam Krishna it is God's law that you have to bear the consequence of sin won't Chile be hot if you eat it then he is telling you don't notice early in in our younger life we don't notice that is the problem so this is the truth it is going to happen you don't have any other option if you do something bad you have to suffer and that that is the law of karma of the Hindu religion there is a lot of wood fuel in cooking in the Kali temple induction ishe he is giving the example way dude burns nicely in the beginning of course in American life we don't burn wood all his gas and electricity except run but in the village is even today they will be burning and when you are burning a wood sometimes they'll be going and camping outside when you're burning a hood if the water is there in the beginning it will burn but afterwards all the water will accumulate at the back so he is telling if you have committed seen in the beginning you won't feel but at the end of your life all will come cool tools mara kottagudem Samara Ruto's Mara retucked them smaller in the phoenician it says everything will come in the mind so that he is telling but when the wood is burned all the water collects and it puts out the fire in the oven that's why you should beware of last anger greed and so on why morality shahmeer away conduct a question and he himself said to help yourself the morality not to heart others not to cheat others not to create problem for others and all these things what for as because we are a society as because there's rules and regulation as because the police and army is there no not with that it is for my good the moment people will understand these all these things will be it will not totally stop it can neighbor good and dad will always be there because both have been created by God so it will be there but at least we can do something better meant in this society by only telling these unless and until you accept law of karma you can never make the human society good neighbor so that is the law of karma that is human I mean Hinduism that introduced not only introduces a truth not that just for the sake of the Society's goodness now it is the truth the law of karma so that's why it is this why did God create wicked people this man is asking salam o Krishna is his will his sport both knowledge and ignorance at ermengarde no media magnate a Thomas a Beretta in bhagavad-gita other mandar mama t they think that what is adharma it is Dharma so they will be performing so seriously I went to Asian garage areas place and i SAT with everyone for Prashad I'm a monk but even then the people who came there Brahmins and to show that they'll all if we had body so that you can see that the white the Hebdo be beat is there and they'll be true in the your roti and all those things throwing I told why you're throwing if I touch you I'll be impure and we are so careful they are so careful not to touch and what is there practicing Vedanta what is Vedanta the God has created everything look at the fun of it they are so serious about it and the portion crotch area cannot do anything because these people are all round and they will be so serious all the time big eyes very serious all key parts of religion at verbum Dharma meaty so that is the other mandar mama te amo
