[262: Panchama Veda 262 : Seven Planes Of Jnani's Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI6sA7Nwmac)

good evening dear devotees and friends we'll be studying the panchama veda the gospel of krishna let us begin [Music] sri 1884 in dakshinesha bhagavan sriram krishna in his room talking with bijay krishna gosiami and many other devotees the discussion is going on at the last time in the last wednesday we studied who can have the spiritual awakening a very important question who can have the spiritual awakening and bhagavan si ramakrishna answering only he who has renounced his attachment to worldly things we read this line before also but this is a very important that all of us millions and millions of people are trying to realize god but the question is who can have it is not this religion that philosophy this path that but only one thing is very clear he who has renounced his attachment to worldly things his attachment to worldly things that much in whatever manner whatever process if we are free from the attachment of the worldly things we are living with that may be having those things but if we are not attached to this friends this is very important because we are in about religion we are a bit confused and that is the reason sometimes we do not understand what is what and what to do and what not to do and very easy way to say i don't believe in religion i don't believe in god so that is very easy to say but to understand the reality this is the only thing no attachment so this is the first thing if the sap of attachment is totally dried up in a man the slightest suggestion kindles his spiritual emotion the spiritual emotion that is about the god and the existence of god that he is so much convinced that his mind is completely withdrawn there is no bondage no attachment no attraction no desire for these worldly things so in his little suggestion immediately his mind goes to that pain and pleasure are inevitable in a body sometimes some people the thing that when we are spiritual when you are religious why there should be suffering that is inevitable as long as the body is there it will be there so i i perhaps i told you that when i was a brahmacari i don't know why a gentleman just started following me he liked me he started brahmachariji wherever he will go i will also follow then afterwards it was so embarrassing i was not understanding i was a novice and what to say to him i cannot say don't come don't follow then what happened one day when he came i also i was there in the summer he came to meet me and i went and sat with him in our meeting room in advertising and in calcutta and there that day i was not feeling well so i took and he is some antibiotic or something some medicine before him oh he said oh my god you being a brahmacari and the monk you two are having this physical pain at atl of course we are having that from the next day he stopped visiting me that was a great relief for me too but this is the way people always think that religion means there'll be no problem no all these things they think that's why bhagavan sinama krishna very clearly mentioning over here is the page 6 5 8 658 pain and pleasure are inevitable in a body he who has realized god dedicates his mind and life his body and soul to god he's constantly thinking about god but it doesn't mean that he won't have the physical problem physical just as it is it goes with all others also same way sudama krishna remained silent a few moments watching the devotees then he said to muhimacharan who was not believing in accepting a guru he said to mahima charan a man should have faith in the words of his guru guru means the spiritual teacher a preceptor the guru is he who has already have that now one thing along with this ramakrishna is telling don't go and judge the character of your guru because you do not know different type of gurus are there their external appearance behavior may be different but if they are genuine their words carries power that's true so that is the main thing sometimes we think that it should be like this in my own life it so happened because uh in the we always see that the rishis munis in the picture and the so they are having the long beard and the long hair they are well built and very the tall like that so imaginative but when i went to take the initiation from the 10th president of the ramakrishna order the srinath swami vireshwara namdaji i was in the beginning when i saw him the small little man lean and thin and no beard no long hair so all these days imagination then i was thinking oh this is the guru but i was thinking guru should be like this and that but he was a very strong and highly spiritual personality friends i am blessed that i was not having any hesitation to receive initiation from him and afterwards i could feel that is truly truly very highly a spiritual personality so this swami virus his figure was like that but but in spirituality he was completely different the funny thing happened so one gentleman came you know sometimes people they're like that they came and he was telling the i like to take initiation from you and then i was in india so in india only president swamiji and the vice president swamiji's they give initiation in europe and america it is different the president swamiji gave permission to us to give the initiation on his behalf we give initiation but there in india no other monks are supposed to give the message in ramakrishna tradition but this person was going on telling me i like to take in these ideas that is embarrassing i told why no you look look like netaji shivajandra you feel like that it's a good looking person you better go and take initiation from uttam kumar is a bengali the movie the very great hero so you better go he is very good looking so you better go and take if only that figure it is not the figure you know what is this guru that in one the couplet it says very nicely so this is beautifully giving an example that the the blackness of the of a coal it goes away when it come in contact with the fire the fire burns it and then makes it all read so completely different as if the dirt of that coal it goes away when it comes in contact with the fire similarly all the dirts all the shortfalls everything goes away when one come in to contact with a guru how by his uppradesh the guidance is spiritual guidances sat the guru power veda what he does he will tell you the difference between the worldly things and the spirituality the god and his creator in this world that he will tell he will teach you how to discriminate how to judge so that is the way one gets the liberation the guru is very very essential we learn everything from someone and that is the guru and when you are going to get the idea about the god the guru is very very essential the guidance of the guru and and you have to have the faith on him devotion and then only the teachings that gives the benefit bhagavan sirama krishna is still linked to this mahima charan why mohimacharan was not ready to accept guru because mahima studied the vedanta this is the problem the undigested thing the vedanta teaches that you are that now to whom they are teaching when you go to a berantin he will he will say again you have to accept that as a guru and he said that i am that brahman you are also the same that much then he is not doing anything so that is the reason those who are trying to follow the path of vedanta means the path of knowledge they should be ready their mind should be ready so when we study the ashtavakra they are the the student who is coming his mind is completely ready and the teacher astra bhaktra the moment he says you are that immediately he realizes that he understands that it's not so easy the janaka when he came at the story goes like that that guru told before i give you initiation you have to give me the guru pranami that guru pranami when he is giving and janaka gave i give my body my mind my soul at your feet and i give all my properties this kingdom to you i am not having anything oh guru please give me the knowledge the guru told well wait over here and he left and he was not coming back in the beginning he was thinking where he has gone he has taken away everything now and left me alone over here and he is not coming back but then as because the janaka was already ready for that he started thinking oh no i have given my body so the pain that i am feeling now standing over here i should not feel because this body doesn't belong to me look at it and then i am thinking whether guru will come back or not i should not think because mind i have given to him and i don't have anything around over here i should not move where i will go because the whole kingdom i have given to him i don't have any place to move i don't apply anywhere to go so he was standing over there like a piece of wood like just like a tree and with a calm mind he got the revelation so that is the way they get the vedantic teaching simply reading some vedantic books and a few slokas of the upanishad and a little bit of these and that vivek ramani and we feel that we are the follower of the gyana margie that is not so easy the bhagavad-gita the great teacher he is not criticizing but he is guiding he is helping he understood mahima charan is having that desire to realize brahman so he is not accepting guru the sudama krishna is teaching him and he is telling the aim of the ghani is to know the nature of his own self in just three four lines suramar krishna is giving the complete idea of the vedanta we read so many hundreds of books but here if we read that so i again and again say the gospel of sirama krishna is the panchama veda it teaches us in every page and so wonderfully so simple way he's teaching us the highest vedanta advaita vedanta and he is telling that the aim of the gyani gyani means one who is trying to realize the brahman and following the path of knowledge the path of discrimination so that is ghani is to know the nature of his own self this is knowledge this is liberation the true nature of the self is that it is the supreme brahman here the eat i is capital that that is supreme brahman the brahman as we know the students of vedanta and those who are following the classes you know the brahman without attributes and brahman wheat attributes brahman without attributes is a supreme brahman this without attributes is not creating or doing anything so all the goonas satya rajyathama an equilibrium and it is all tranquil and there is no work no desire no action and that is called supreme brahman but when that is changes because brahman itself wanted the change so it becomes swaguna brahma then the gunas which was already there the in the important form now gets activated so swaguna now we can understand so the satya raja tama all these things get activated so that is a separate brahman it is called when we go back to the our own self this is called knowledge the liberation the true nature of the self is that it is supreme brahman the true nature of the self what is the self that is our soul that with the power of which we are we can think that we are surviving i am talking i am moving i am eating i am doing so much so many works with the help of that particular power which is nothing but the reflection of the supreme brahman that brahman the chaitanya the consciousness and that is also known as self so that when we go back immediately it revealed to us how because we go and merge into that and this is a subjective experience no one can express to what happens after that no one can say like that but there is a process to go back to that bhagavatam krishna will teach us i and the supreme brahman are one but this knowledge is hidden on account of maya this knowledge is hidden on account of maya knowledge is there already but it is not revealed to us because maya what is the maya again the power of that brahman and what he is doing and again and again we have discussed the maya is completely covering the truth and then superimposing something on that that is the power of maya and we are under the spell of that we cannot remove that cover the moment we can remove that we need not to go and find it is already there the brahma-gyana are the issuer love that means we are going and having something achieving something an object somewhere we go and find it not like that already there but we are unaware aware of it sometimes the people they put their glasses on their head and they forget they go on searching for the glass the glass is already there then someone will say hey touch your head and you find that and he will touch and then find the glasses over there that much the guru will come and say you are already that where you are searching what you are searching so that is the when we are talking it seems it is just like finding the glasses on the heat it is as simple as that but because of the maya we are deluded we don't like to believe it don't like to believe it so we're going to go on searching in if someone says you are brahmana why you have to go for all we are not satisfied the more the trouble to reach to a holy place or to add more difficulties that we feel happy oh this must be like this the spirituality must be like this you should not eat anything and then on so and so day that you should not drink water or you should and we are very happy oh our guru told that we should not eat this we should not eat that we cannot sit over here we cannot lie down over there a lot of do's and don'ts a big list and the student is very happy why because we are weak we do not know so that's why the vedanta particularly vedanta the path of knowledge means to those adikari that adhikari means a student whether he is ready or not and in there it gives the long definition of dhadhikari adhikaritu adita veda vedanka asmin mani janmantareva is a big definition and we think just we'll read a few books or listen to some of the talks of some swamis and we are following the path of knowledge is it so easy no one should not make that mistake knowing is no problem as a that's okay that academic knowledge is all right and we should understand that but friends again and again i am following the path of bhagavan si rama krishna his instructions he says you must understand your position and from there you should start troubling when narendra naat came sirama krishna overwhelmed seeing him because he was that perfect personality who can really understand the vedanta salam krishna only touched him that much and immediately he went into that samadhi and not only that he was in that condition seeing brahman in everything for three days and three nights just a mere touch but if i am not ready if the sudama question i don't know salaam krishna can do it but even when we are not ready if the sudan krishna is touching my head or embracing me it is not possible so many people came to suramar krishna and so many people got his blessed touch also but could they realize as narendra nat swami this is our preparation whether the student is ready to understand this or not so that is the differences but we should not lose our hope oh i cannot understand not like that swami vivekananda said we are traveling from lower truth to higher truth so we are in this condition what we should do standing that what will be easy for us he is guiding us he is telling this is this i said to harish this is the whole thing the gold is hidden under a few basket full of earth and you must remove the earth that's all he is giving an example the gold is there and some earth is on that remove that earth and find it out guru will tell you the preceptor will tell you that gold is hidden within your heart what is that gold your own self now this is the way you should remove what is the way take the name of god sing the glory of god sometimes in quiet place try to meditate and sincerely pray to god and those things will be done it will be removed have faith have faith so this is the way it goes he is telling the bhaktas retain eye consciousness the ghani he said now the bhaktas retain eye consciousness the ghanis do not that is the only difference only the other day someone was asking whether it is the same goal where the bhakta is reaching and the gyani is reaching yes but the bhakta is reaching to god because he wants to see god he wants to live with god he wants to talk to god he wants the company of god he wants or she wants the devotee wants but the gang he wants to go and merge with it that is the difference but we go to that yes he taught to t how to establish oneself in the true self merge the mind in the buddhi the mind means so many thoughts are constantly passing and that is called mind the mana that is constantly so many thoughts will be there and it you should give it to buddhi what is that buddhi now there are we you know that in in hindus we always have that four compartment thing which is known as mind but we say mana buddhism here the mind we should understand the mind means the so that is the mind which you can't take the decision is dwindling but here the wayne's bhagavan is telling the mana the mind should be merged with buddhi that means all our impressions that is there in the store housed on the karana all those things should be merged with the buddhi what is that buddhi it is a determinative capacity i am going to think like this and all these impressions that i am having having from my past birth it doesn't matter anything but the buddhi says there is only one there is no two and all my desires which are creating the ripples in my mind i stopped that that's why the purity used to teach give the mind to the buddhis sometimes here i was hearing a lecture some teacher was teaching watch your all thoughts that is also the way of meditation watching the thoughts and when we are watching the thoughts my thoughts i am following those thoughts and trying to understand what is thinking where it is going what it wants etc i am separate from my thought that is the important thing not the following the thought i am separating myself from my thought my thought and i are separate the moment we can do that there is the goal and we can now control or we can avoid those thoughts so that is the same way the meditation means you have to stop all the thought waves cheetah is completely cessation nirodha is completely stopped and what chitta britti what is the chittabriti the waves of thoughts british are the waves and that we have to stop how and it's something different processes that it says bhagavatam krishna is telling he heard his promise guru vedanti guru totapuriji and give it to the buddhi and the buddhi will decide no no no we are not going to do anything sit over here calm and quiet then it will become calm and quiet the buddhi is the master and when he giving the command and this chitta and the mana they are all quiet and listening to the master the moment it become quiet that is called meditation one pointed concentrated mind so that is different process we have to understand that merge the mind in the buddhi and the buddhi in the atman then you will be established in your true self when you can separate your thought from you so you the true self that is consciousness you will realize but the i persist down the bhagavad-gita is telling you know the i that persists it cannot be god read off imagine a limitless expanse of water is giving a beautiful example what is this i we always say i but we do not know what is this i if you try to ex explain it will be so difficult ask anyone i have done this i know this i will be able to do this and like that like that if you ask that person who is this i the only answer will be i am the son of so-and-so i belong to that family and i am now in so-and-so position in that office this and that so it is only the social and a family background but that is the true eye when we say i it is associated with this body and mind complex but that is not true i so it that srama krishna is pointing out to that and he is giving the wonderful example and what is that example i persist it cannot got rid of imagine a limitless expanse of water limitless expanse of water srila krishna asking us to imagine above and below he already said the limitless again to make the impression what type it is say he goes on repeating above and below only water before and behind it is water right and left everywhere there is water in that water is placed a jar filled with water again there is water inside the jar and the water outside the jar but the jar is still there the eye is the jar see how nicely he said what is the consciousness it is above below in the left and the right in the front the back everywhere now still there is a little difference i am making that difference and that is only that jar or the injar or maybe whatever the metal jar that thing though it is inside water outside water but still with things i am separate only that much but still then it is so difficult to go beyond the eye anywhere everywhere it is i i and i the other day one young lady came hardly nine or ten years so i was trying to tell her so this is the i know this is i know she has read a lot all over books she has read but when you try to say that i know i know i know there's a self-confidence it's okay it's good but at the same time when we say from that childhood i i i everywhere but try to understand what is this i and when the from the spiritual point of view this i is the greatest bondage that's why we cannot realize god and we cannot feel that we are god we are that brahman we are that consciousness this is the predicament and it's so funny so though it is so simple but still we cannot break that why because this is maya and how to get rid of this maya because this is the power of god we have to go to god only and to ask please stop this maya it's like a ha the dog terrible dog so please stop your dog it's barking trying to bite me please stop it and the owner will say hey stop it immediately it will go away it will be quiet so how to go beyond this maya we have to go to god that is the easiest way sirama krishna is telling even after attaining knowledge the ghani keeps his body as before but the fire of knowledge burns away his last and other passions suramar krishna going side by side giving the description of the bhakta and the gyana the devotion and knowledge as muhimacharan has a bent of knowledge bend of mind towards knowledge so he wants to do that so it is telling like this the mahima charan to teach my mushroom is telling us both the paths are the valid paths and both are correct good but the gyanomark is like this and bhakti mark is like this now how what happens some this is the process now what happens after the realization of the self of the brahman if this is like this ramakrishna is telling after attaining that knowledge the self-knowledge the brahma-gyana the gyani keeps his body as before but the fire of knowledge bonds away his last and other passions so this is the great master it's so clear those who really like to know that person is there he is also showing his anger maybe telling that i like to eat this i like to visit that i like to put on this but his mind is not at all attached to all these any moment it can withdraw this ma saradamani devi swami vivekananda's life and the leaving example of all this the attachment in the beginning we are telling who can realize the one who is not having the attachment who is not having all any possession no he is not telling like that that's a wrong conception tiago means you have to give up everything and then go that you know that naked body sometimes some people go like that in india they behave like that they are thinking if we go like this i'm not having any position not even a piece of cloth on my body i am not having any position that is not the idea idea you are carrying in your mind that is the main thing there is a beautiful story maybe we will come across over here krishna himself said that the usually the monastics they take the vow so obviously they don't like to go in contact with the ladies women so that is the vow of celebrating like the catholic priests like the catholic monks like that like that so indian monks the buddhist monks the catholic monks the bow of celebrity and the guru told that you should avoid the women don't try ever touch them now what happened the two the disciples they were going suddenly they heart someone was crying and asking for help please save me save me then they ran and this found that a lady she is drowning in the river carried about the current by the current the one immediately plunged into the water and then swim and then brought her back and the other was shouting no no no don't go there she's a lady we cannot touch her so that was the two got the teaching from the same guru but one is thinking in this way the guru asks her not to touch the lady so we should not do but when she is dying it is not a man or a woman it is a person that dying and if it is possible for us we should try to help but he forgot this man went and brought her back and helped her to reach back her own home and in the village and then came back in the meantime the other one the puritan he came back to the astrama and he was telling to his guru my friend he violated your instruction and he has done this he touched that lady and he then took her to her house and like this and that you know what guru said guru said he only carried that lady up to her from that water up to her house and into that safety then he forgot about but look at your mind you are still carrying that so this is important so when our mind should be completely free from any attachment any desire so suramar krishna is telling the gyanis the man of knowledge they're having that knowledge but they're behaving just like a normal person having that body and but there is no attachment so this is very very important and even after attaining knowledge the ghani keeps his body as before but the fire of knowledge burns away is lost in other passions many days ago during an electric storm he is giving example salah krishna any statement he will give any teaching he will give immediately he'll give an example so that we can understand it very clearly and can remember it many days ago during an electric storm a thunderbolt struck the kali temple we saw that no injury had been done to the doors only the points of the screws were broken by telling these immediately he is giving the example the doors of the body and the passions last and so forth are the screws so when the thunderbolt comes and the body is all right it'll be like that that means the knowledge has come knowledge has done body is as it is it is not changing but at the same time this completely goes sun the people always think religious people means they'll be having an different aura around them now it is that normal body sometimes some people are good looking sometimes or not like that that is not the thing but the main thing how to understand whether a person is a religious person or not whether he has the attachment or not how to understand with the attachment or not he is having the ego or not so unselfishness and love these are the two year stakes to understand a holy person unselfishness and love for all so these are the two things ramakrishna is telling again he loves to talk only about god so how to understand gyani he feels pained if one talks about the worldly things the veda speaks of the seven planes of mind krishna he never read the scripture in that way but he heard it from the different scholars and whatever he heard he remembered it and moreover his own revelations his own realizations that is the unique way coming out as his teaching in his telling the veda speaks of the seven plains of mind when the ghani's mind ascends to the fifth plane he cannot listen to anything or talk of anything but god at the stage only at that stage only words of wisdom come from his lips friends i will tell you the mostly we know that almost all people nowadays yoga is so popular and mostly people they know about the seventh places of the yoga the yoga these are the seven according to the yoga but we do not know much about the bhakti the devotion and also the gyana and devotion also they say it is shraddha sadhu-sanga bhagavat bhajan these are the sevens means that confidence confidence in the words of the guru and also the scripture satsangha sadhu-sanga means holy company bhagavad-gita and having the love for god and singing the god's glory on earth they will never discuss anything except god unnecessarily we discuss so many things is a wastage of time bhagavani asakti is a great attachment to god asakte is attachment attachment to god not to the worldly things attachment to god then it comes he goes into trance bhabha visa and prema ishari the prema the word when they use that means it is only one pointed love one way one flow it doesn't want anything else i love you oh god that's much so everything is nothing but the god these are the seven stages of the devotion now krishna is talking about the gyana the gyanis are also having the seven planes what are that first is subway cha second bicharana manasa then sattvapatti these are the seven so very fast stage is the desire to be free so it says this desire holy desire what is that holy desire i like to be liberated this is another word mumuksuta the mumuksuta also i want to get liberation who can say that one who has already realized that this world is so temporary when he feels the world is temporary so naturally he wants to go back to the permanent one which is god which is the brahman so when that desire comes then what happens bicharana discrimination bichara it is the inquiry it is the judging things so that bichara oh i saw my grandfather was also having this then he purchased this plot of land and constructed house then one day he died then the father was somewhere else now that house is a haunted house nobody lives over there and we cannot sell that property also for so many other things then why we are so much attention to the properties to the wealth to name and fame where it goes what in the world we do so many millions are dying without food in hunger and a few people they are having so much of wealth they do not know how to use it they'll be simply throwing food and wasting money and that is just little ego i am wealthy man i can spend like this but that is completely foolish you cannot eat gold and whatever the wealth that you are having in different places that is not going to help you to survive you are going to die and when you will die so many millions of rich people were there kings were there who is going to remember them but we remember those who were broad-minded charitable people they used their mind their brain their capacity and their earned money but at the same time they were not selfish people they understood this much money is sufficient for me and they gave it away to others they are great people and in the next birth they will be much higher they will go to higher spiritual level that is called bicharana that's called the discrimination what i am going to do so the first step is am i happy in this world after i was thinking if i get this position if i am successful in my life in past the the only the other day one lady was telling when i was very small then they told it is only class 10 and in class 10 if you get the first division then they'll be you are all free after that another two years only class 12 the grade 12 then after that 12 is over they said now is only another three years graduation then the master degree then this and if you are not doing the any research work or getting the doctorate degree so it is so shameful and then of that also then one day i started thinking so many people are every year passing out from the universities having these then what they are going to do with that earning little money then one day people will forget and that fellow also god forbid maybe one day we will forget what actually he learned or she learned and then other people some nurses they will be helping him or her to eat and some one day he will die is this is the whole circle and for that i am wasting my life so this is the way they always think and these are the people they come for monastic life the monastic lives are like this they go on thinking so subha the that pure the thinking that is the first step then bicharana the discrimination third tamim nasa the beautiful words they have used the mind become thin why it is not thinking about the worldly things there's so many things when you read the newspapers so many ideas comes oh this is happening here it is happening there so so much of heaviness on the mind because we are getting all the informations of the worldly things but when we are completely free of that only thinking about the god and the god i love and only the some of the songs praising that god only a little few things so as if the mind become very slim tanu manasa then it comes the sattvapatti sattvapati means self-realization immediately then comes the fifth stage about which the bhagavad-gita krishna is mentioning non-attachment this asama sakti they are there they're living in this world roaming in the world mixing with worldly people talking to them but they are not a test that is the beauty that's why they give the example of the swan what the swan it is floating on the water and that's going down to the water coming up the moment it comes up there is not a single drop of water on it that is called swan the ramakrishna mission symbol if you see in the center there is a picture of so on don't take it so literally the ramakrishna mission is having there's a swan as their page not like that it's only the symbol and the symbol is this most of the hindu things are symbol but we don't understand that so this is the problem they have given the symbol that the sheba is having the snake the snake means that is the kundalini shakti now we have drawn the sheba is sitting on the snake and having the snake as a girl and snake as a all the wrong thing no it is not that some people even go and give the milk to the snake thinking that this is the shivers there is no shivers of course all the all the living beings of god but the snakes are not drinking milk the st it is not the snake's food but anyway some people think like that but that is a wrong conception that is here itself self-realization and when the self-realization means their next thing is asam or shakti or sama shakti and that is called non-attachment that is the greatest strength of a yogi one who has already realized god or trying to realize god should not make any wrong conception that i should not live with this and live with that they should be in everything but power is non-attachment this is the way then non-perception of object and yoga transcend so these are the seven suramar krishna is mentioning about the fifth one and he's mentioning here the vedas speaks of the shachidananda brahman brahman is neither one not two and this is a unique way once again sudama krishna is mentioning if you have the conception of one obviously you will have the conception of many so the brahman means not the conception of one and not the two islam krishna is telling two means many it is not one it is not many it is that's all asti conception is so clear and very simple word he is mentioning because he is the god himself he is that brahman himself in the human form the veda speaks of satchidananda brahman brahman is neither one nor two it is between one and two it cannot be described either as existence or as non-existence it is between existence and non-existence when the devotee develops raga bhakti passionate love of god he realizes him so one sentence is talking about the knowledge and next line he is talking about the devotion the bhakti and this is the way he is going on describing the god he realizes now the veda speaks of sat means existence cheat is the knowledge and ananda means the beliefs now apart from these they cannot describe the brahman that is the problem and so they are only giving the hints and getting that hints we can go up to that and we after the realization and brahman what happens we become brahman and we cannot come back to tell even we are coming back we cannot describe the brahman because it is beyond that and in different way they have given that example natara there is no sun there is no another light the eye cannot reach over there the hair cannot you cannot touch it like that right there so many ways in the upanishads they are describing around the brahman it is only your own realization swami vivekananda said in bengali in a poem he has written one who has realized he only can understand by telling it is impossible reading it is impossible but trying to narrate it is impossible it is only that experience and you cannot understand anything of that just by reading just conception is coming krishna is going to the devotees when the devotee develops raga bhakti raga bhakti is the ultimate devotion for god bhakti that you have to get up in the morning you have to do so many japa you have to do these and that is all be these means the rules are there bidi means rules this is the system you have to follow that and when a person is doing that he does that because of the routine and slowly slowly that loves that goes and goes and then one day it develops pure love for god that is called raga raga means attachment without the god i cannot survive without god i don't see anything so that is called raga bhakti so that raghav the passionate love of god he realizes him friends let us stop over here it is almost time and in the in our next wednesday next class we will begin from here the seven planes and particularly the raga bhakti the devotion thank you so there are some questions the first question is from chitra can you please explain how swaguna brahman and means its own and saguna the brahmana with the qualities the brahman means consciousness when it is with qualities that means is activated active that is called saguna brahma thank you the next question is from srima vishwas she's asking why is it not used to tell from childhood naan is your own oh good srimaji is the teaching you know one lady she did it and that's why swami vivekananda in his talk also mentioned about that that lady's name was madalasa have you heard about that madalasa this madalasa she was a gyani and she was married to a king and when she gave the birth of a child and she used to all the time sing before that baby and is to go on telling you are brahman you are brahman you are brahman you are not this body you are not this mind you are not belong to this world and one after another are all children became when they grew up they realize that this world is illusory all temporary and they all left for the meditation so the madala should do it so if all become motherless then this world won't be there and if the world is not there then what will happen to the scripture to whom we will explain thank you i'm just joking thank you now let us complete this need is a [Music] namaste
