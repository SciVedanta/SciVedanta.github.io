[181. Panchama Veda 181 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-jq9zzXFkQ)

good evening let us chant this mantra tava cotton Ratan Tata jeevan KO be very written calmodulin seven among golem shri mata Tom Boonen de bourree dodging aah now this is the twenty-fifth chapter we are going to start that show me a nickel on that is translation of the kilometre big article on Rita the gospel of sri ramakrishna the advice to pundit Shoshanna Saddam trishna was in his room sitting on a mat sprayed on the floor this is the account of the Monday June 30th 1884 pundit Shahada and a few devotees we're with him on the mat and the rest sat on the bare floor sure in the Baba Rama in Harish lot - Hegira and others were present it was about four o clock in the afternoon to get the joy of reading gospel of ceramic Krishna one should also be introduced with these people the devotees who are regularly visiting Raghavan Salama Tichenor and they are not ordinary people they are coming to a very modern thought spiritual thought you know the majority of the people they like to spend time are just flow along with the normal the flow that goes in the society but these people the Balaram bow she was a very rich person and he used to come all the time to attend whenever there was a possibility sri indra was the deputy magistrate was a very high position in those days for the Indians he also used to come in we know that he was a headmaster of school and he was aiming from Calcutta University Harish law tube and hot rod these are the people who afterwards became Chaminade Bhutan under so these are the people and many many more days to come if we know these characters know these people we will understand how they slowly transformed spirituality is nothing but transformation but this transformation the Hindus they don't believe in conversion they believe in transformation why should I have to go and impose my ideas on somebody else who is not understanding anything conversion means imposing my idea on somebody else and getting him converted getting him forced to follow my path my philosophy here the Hinduism means transformation he is understanding his thought processes are changing that is worth it was about four o'clock in the afternoon the drama Krishna had made pandita sugar six days before in Calcutta we got that account we read that and now the pundit had come to - initiate to visit the master now the Calcutta that was the capital of today in India and punish her shudder was there sai Ram Krishna went to meet him and Salaam Tichenor was very eager to meet those people who were trying to follow the path of religion so this is the speciality what the glue that we get the car goes to them who is trying to be good trying to realize God this is not an ordinary thing ceramic richness going to these people they are trying in their own way to realize God to explain God to analyse God to understand God and God himself in the form of ovens Ramakrishna is going to them to help them now slum Krishna went to him we have read that account he went to one devotees house then he took the launch took rest and in an appointed time he went and made the pundits each other it was a great famous indeed as a scholar and cinema Krishna is going and meeting him talking to him and afterwards but wins Ramakrishna is going this is very special he was from a very poor family background no education almost and he was not having any other credential but he is going at far and above screaming and meeting these people not that sir I have come to see you not like that his green hat path and also after that he is influencing them to come to him so these are the things that are the proofs of the existence of God God's power sometimes some people they ask is there God the life of Saddam apiece needs to prove that there is God as because the man who was not having anything when he is going to make the pendant like Shahada not that all people could go but he is green and when he is talking he's getting impressed swami vivekananda came over here he met the professors and they were impressed influenced why that is the power of God manifesting through these people so that people are gettting are people like this they are very very egoistic but they won't accept your views immediately the Shahada so this is very important why these accounts that we are reading because very very important this is the proof of God and this person now influences are not only influenced he was lucky that's why his sadhana he not only read the scripture and discussed about that many many people did do but he had a desire to realize God so he has come all the way from Calcutta to meet Ramakrishna and that particular day which was June 30th which was Monday 4 o clock master Masha is giving the complete description and on a walk and a flow there's a mat that spreaded the very ordinary and on that the god is sitting and these people are also sitting some other people just on the bare floor not any other arrangements and they are they are discussing very simple living high thinking as the people is to say that was the lifestyle of the Indians simple living high thinking so this is Ramakrishna and he is telling the punty towards the follower the path of young knowledge path of knowledge the pundit is to follow the parent as usually that we and some of the people they always think and then we will discuss about that the master was explaining this path to him that means the path of knowledge he said now this is important the path of knowledge if you most of you have read you were associated with the become to society for such a long time you know what is the path of Atlanta Nita and Lila mcdeere unchanging eternal constant that is ninja but we from our day-to-day experiences we know there so many things are happening all the time the past present future so many things are going on how can he say this detail so that has been termed as Li la la la Lila Lila means things that is changing like the waves ocean deep ocean there is no wave but on the top of the surface of the ocean there are waves so obviously ceramic isnan is giving that example meter and Lila this we have to understand otherwise we won't be able to follow the philosophy of Solana Krishna he said begun in true and true when there was a converse another doubt that rose in the minds of some good disciples of Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda asked those people not even to worship the picture of ceramic isne because you are Barrentine there's a still the Ostrom is there and the inter Swami I was talking with him this time I am thinking to invite the young charming junior dinars and in advaitha sama in Himalaya they have developed the structure and they are telling we like to invite the people from all over the world to come and be here and we like to organize the retreats in the Himalaya and that was the place where I am awakened and I like this name of that particular places Maya body now this place sharmaji stopped worshipping the photo of his gurus Ramakrishna our ideas and naturally the one he company he was the disciple of Saddam additional but he he was a disciple of swami vivekananda side and he wrote to mother and mother say see ramakrishna was a grating and he were also tweeted that this operating conception means we are not accepting the existence of this world but does it mean that we should simply go and commit suicide this world is nothing so we are going to commit suicide no you do understanding then automatically it will go down Raghavan Serrano krishna's giving the example there is something happened and don't try to disturb that particular thing in his in your body when it is really not completely cure when you disc you're automatically the dry skin will drop you need not to bother about that but before that if you're forcing then it will again aggravate and the blood will come and the problem will occur so that is exactly he's telling Victor and Villa this person this / did he is a scholar in Sanskrit so they call for deal this person is following the path of ghana knowledge and petitioner is using this world Nikhil the constant but you have to Dalila do the two aspects of the same reality the two aspects of the same reality on the basis of this realization this teaching shammed awakened the Saint whoever is serving the poor the downtrodden is serving the living gods he's not emotional is on the basis of the realization anything that you see knew that human being particularly and nothing but the manifestation of God they may not know that way they may not be aware but this is true Nita and Leela are the two aspects of the one and the same reality who is there in device' belong under has assumed different forms for the sake of his Leela brahmana epochal bona Tottenham on Newcomb Barton Rupa Kalpana now we will discuss about that why the world kalpana imagine why that word has been used over here pathognomonic important to help the devotees for the benefit of the devotees the Brahman which is one and without any without second he has taken so many different forms so that Brahman sat-chit-ananda Rupa because Brahman we cannot explain but the searched on under that epithets that is given just to have that idea such sheet Anandi saruba his existence is the knowledge and he is the joy or the please so this conception is Nita and Leela as he described of the ultimate reality the master every now and then become unconscious in Samadhi the master Masha is mentioning that it is not an ordinary teacher teaching as a supreme god who has taken the form of a monster Ramakrishnan to help the people to understand particularly the modern age people are very gristick completely deluded and their concentration only in the body so the God has come and he is he is giving these teachings and those things which happen hundred years before more than hundred years there the description when he is explaining this The Leela he is going back to meet them can he imagine that while he talked she was intoxicated with spiritual father he said to the pendant my dear said Brahman is immutable and immovable like mount Sumeru just take an example he gave like now so mean you cannot move it at the same time but who is immovable can also move this is the the main line one that is immoral can also move because it is all powerful so this is the conception the Vedanta and in the be hunter and the main pastrami rubicund is one of his lecture that is delivered in the London in 1896 he delivered that lecture purely on the bed anta and in the beginning he's telling the most difficult question again taking guns from for the baton team from one which is no part in movable unchangeable how this world has come from Brahman everything has come that is the valentin way of telling how because you say that it is not changing but all the change that we see over here how it is possible so that be worth the bother and parinamavada again and again we find that this to once it be part about a complete transformation another is parinamavada and that pre nama the changing completely Roberta as if it has change but in reality it is not so the parenting the profound they accept see this is the B birth the water is not the parinamavada or in the parinamavada pranaam about the means the milk it is completely become the yoghurt the milk has become yoghurt completely Esprit now the car has become these livers Brahman has become this in us is it like this no it cannot be the god exhausted completely and it has become the world no it cannot be because world is constantly transforming moving changing God cannot change God cannot die there cannot be any changes so the idea that our bid on things are putting forward a more acceptable one thing is very clear from one everything has come I am talking from the point of view of the philosophy so don't mix it up with the ideas of the science because science is still trying to find out from where all this creation has still going on the green or researching and here they concluded that from the one which is all-pervading consciousness all these things have come now two questions are coming is it complete transformation or apparent transformation the parenting say it is be birth the apparent dance permission in the pancetta she with Duran Domini he said he come Eva Adityan son Nam Roop Bieber Cheatham now what is this world only two nama and Rupa nothing else even that one eva is stressing on that is only one a dtmc this is the beauty the way they give the argument if you say the one conception of two comes so the heck they are breaking there's not two so what remains one so don't think about the two so he come only one eva stressing on that is only a tedium there is no - then again it says son nama Rupa be Birgitta the Sanskrit word diverge it means we doubt that cannot be nama and Rupa name and for whole wall that we see is nothing but the name and father so that is the way we can understand the whole world anything that we see is nothing but the nama and Rupa go to par the Veda Vyasa Shankar Acharya they are all there giving this support to be worth the bother and this be worth the bother they say that true Maya that is coming through Maya a prism through that it is coming again and again in different places show me we become the same so if there was a prison nothing was there very clear but someone kept a red clock back and from the other side people's artists raved when in reality it is not having any color just because the association of that here in advaitha they say the Satya that truth can be analyzed or understand from three point of view first T's param article transcendental this transcendental truth is Brahman is there and nothing else param arteaga param that smells highest and that art what is the highest arthur highest truth that only brahman the pure consciousness is there and nothing else taken via Veronica this is pragmatic brahma satyam jagat certain now this very moment Raghavan see Ramakrishna he is telling Nick dear eternal and Leela the transformation both Athiya so he is actually telling they have a hard occur this Bihar occurs at the why because our mind cannot accept the param article we are not ready so one should not misunderstand the explanation of Raghavan see Ramakrishna some of the people they say oh he is actually supporting the desert non not pure non duality he is supporting the another view we should start with no pure at the waiter but when he is talking with the people like the hours for our betterment he is giving this idea why because we'll help us we can understand that there is now nothing is there if you just read what will happen one lady she was interested to understand the Gyana yoga I suggested Xiaomi become this book she has written that and she's very happy so that again and again you have to read and then you have to understand otherwise it is very impossible why because we are limited by time space and causation we cannot go beyond that now when a scientists say oh my god in your blood there are so many things I see the blood and nothing is there okay why you say oh there is these there is that the sugar is there this is there that in this blood I don't see anything but through that particular machine they are going to that so both our reality person who is not understanding there's also reality you cannot simply note that oh nothing is going to happen to them forget about them now cinema Krishna is embracing those though they are not capable he is slowly slowly making them perfect that is the beauty of ceramic is not she wasn't that highest Advaita so when he was talking about the duality he has again and again going back to the non duality into the Samadhi stage but coming down only for us and he refined the Advaita the transcendental is very difficult for us to understand then we have our aarika pragmatic brahma satyam jagat also satya and third protein our Shakur Pratibha Harshita is completely apparent that is the process the Barrentine they always apply pretty logical apparent brahma satyam jagan mithya and what is this media may tell the moment of what we use the word sanskrit word media it is not existing not is existing but the way we are thinking that is a mistake so brahma satyam jagan Mita that is the Protagoras out there this pathological Sathya that is exactly where they start with and then we crossed through then finally we reach to the param arcticus our table so this three type of explanation varam Arctica babylonica and pretty much it these are the three stages and this moment it will be good for us if we take the second one because we are understanding the whole thing in that way now I will just give a hint as swami vivekananda in his lecture he tried to explain he drew on the paper and explaining the brahman becoming the jagat how it is then if you read the the Gyana yoga that is page 108 there he has given that first is this absolute and that is traveling through time space and causation and becoming animals that this is very very very unique way very special way very simple way we can say simplest first is the absolute which has no form no name all pervading but very difficult to even in in truth but we have to go back to that how so coming down it is becoming universe how it is becoming universe through that prism is traveling through time space and causation and what is the realization process in the same book in page 172 sharmaji I am just caught in one line it is impossible to be perfect here there's a funny story the one father was asking I think I saved this one before when father was asking the congregation in the church the God is the only perfect person is there anyone perfect here everybody said no naturally they're quiet but one person from the back seat raised his hand the father from the pulpit he looked at that do you think you're perfect he said not me the first husband of my wife because every time that lady used to say my first husband was perfect and you or not so he got disgusted so here he was telling that mentioning that so this is the funny thing you can never become perfect in this world why because the world is like that it cannot be it is impossible now suppose you go to s hot place and there if you know why it is odd in Chicago it is so wonderful comfortable and cold that places like that you cannot say like that knowing everything you are going so you have to be ready for that type of atmosphere in the as long as you are in the world world will be like this there will be frames and the same suddenly it will become enemy and brother and sisters they are growing up together and just for a little property of the parents they become enemies it is this truth why because this world it becomes like this that's what I saw me Bakugan see Ramakrishna said you must apply the oil in your hand before breaking the jackfruit the raw jackfruit if you are they even the jackfruit dry period also is so difficult the sticky things should not be in your hand we have to what is that application when we are going to have this world the people will be like this only we have to have heart those people in our table bottom class again and again in there and the copy the money is telling the last time we were reading that Kapila money who are the bad people naraka he said what is that naraka assets Sangha those who were assert what has been by our selfish those were our own selfish they leave for themselves to use the others for their own benefit they are assault company of this type of people and not occur like the hell conception and L is nothing these only and suffering will come torture will come and all these things because so you have to avoid them then and there one person came to know go and see Ramakrishna and he was telling my friend don't like to come to you and he I loved him so much and he is not talking with me because I'm coming to you exit etc this is I'm Krishna they try to three times to continue the friendship if you don't feel that he'll be transporting and coming forget about that you have to go to the truth and don't wait for others whether they will come or not that is the decision you have to Dec and we always feel the emotional way and I will take everyone to the temple all of them they'll become no nothing is going to happen they will go in their own way you just go and inform but so this is the time space and causation this is in between standing and we have to go through this is the central idea of the what wait times patient got space and positional like the glass through which the absolute is seen it appears as the universe that is what Swami American the state and I am NOT putting the whole thing just gist of it not a realization process Swamiji said it is impossible to be perfect here we have to get out by reversing the process by reversing the process sometime people they want to know about the spiritual growth so what is the spiritual growth what is meditation what is concentration what is all these reversing the process what is the process that is going on all our ingress all our senses going out to the same subjects reverse the process that's all and that's why I thought once Ramakrishna suggested if you are angry with someone don't be angry with any particular person any person behind the with God a fight with God I know that through that man you are giving me the ball this problem why what have I done anything wrong if I have done I am your son I am your daughter I am your child why don't you help me instead of that why you are insulting me in this way so if we go and talk to the guard what happens my mind goes to God so that is the important thing and then the morality and charity will begin this is the beauty this ashram in Vivekananda only small words when we are reversing some people to say are we progressing in the spiritual life how will know I am seeing the Blue Star I am seeing the green light all these things they are telling very clear if you are producing in the spiritual life two things will happen what is there that morality and charity the morality and charity will happen so Dhanam why Donham is so important the spiritual life whatever I have earned whatever I am having is so I am attached to all those now I am giving it to others without expecting any result so that is called Donna is so difficult and what is the morality the spirituality I am having that soul within me and obviously all these beings are nothing but the manifestation of the same consciousness how can I have the differences how can I say don't come to me how can I say don't touch me that is this morality people don't understand so many things are happening this temple they have not allowed that temple they should not go Hindus oh my god these Hindus are becoming this way how this is the tradition someone some time they said that tradition what is that to you why should you have to continue this tradition which is not good why didn't you understand because this is the someone sometimes said that you have to follow this bus so where is your own head what do you want judgment we have lost it in the name of tradition we are actually torturing so this is the ignorance what is that tradition that which is good one gentleman who was sharmaji was telling me don't destroy the the tradition of he was meaning the different way of the title people towards their tradition they can't use the clothings they don't know how to wash the hands also forget about other things so dirty constantly drinking dying at a younger age and all these traditions that we will encourage you think no that is not tradition their forefathers wish to leave in the branches of the tree shall I also ask our boys who are studying the science go and build the house on the top of the tree and leave over the earth rich people they do treetop houses the fun of it but not that they need truly deep there so this tradition in the name of data what does it mean by tradition we have to and that is not that the ignorance should be accepted as a tradition so Swamiji said we have to completely change the more backward we to go back to the source and how you'll understand that we are going to the right path our process our experiences and our to all that try that we were doing to develop the spirituality these two qualities will develop one is morality and charity committee said what is though what is the watchword not me at all now living some eg here let us further the words of sharma vivek afraid my talk to Baba Rama Krishna and he's in a great mood and in a when the the gentleman was listening to him when did she dr. Kitchell Ahwahnee is a great person when he accepted salaam occasionally on krishna was in it and a great joy you can say in Steam's soft songs he sang that nineteen one after another he was green or man singing who is there that can understand what mother Kali's and that way he was green on singing and one time he said but it again said are you going to sing again he again sang he was so happy he was so happy why the song to express the joy why the joy because this person has understood the meaning of spirituality and now they sad and he is telling the pundit had studied the Vedas and other scriptures he loved to discuss philosophy such see the hundred three years before also the same type of people love to discuss philosophy only discussion intellectual satisfaction it comes but in reality in practical it is not the one indeed as a sanskrit scholar is to teach our Swami's and prematurely ins the elderly person once he didn't come so the better part of thirty active Ramachari to visit his house to go and see is he all right why he is not coming see you ain't and he was sitting in the room reception room and there one young lady came and gave that little water as a tradition so the RTT the guest has kind of gone glass of water first she came then afterwards dad went it came and blew maturely and oh the Swami's the worried about you are you alright while you're not coming and then when he told we like to have a glass of water oh no your daughter has given then the 22 is not my daughter she's my fourth wife and she is teaching that pundit is teaching without them so that is exactly the ended Brittini came and he told the Swami aha Murad we are studying Vedanta from him and don't bother about that he is the learned man the drama and all those things don't follow his character so the only that that much we are accepting not following him sometimes some people to become the mom used to go to master Marcia and when the mother came to know about it the mother told white will go to him why do you go and talk with grease Chandra course there were people no doubt but if you like to become the monkey should go to shut Baba Rama and Raja Rahman and the G Sedan and the G preeminent the G go to tame because this is the life that they are living and the scripture that he was studying and completely different the some people they are earning lot of money just by explaining some of the treatises Abba danta because they know the language they know how to put those language is sort of the intellectual joy dedicated one thing that is coming and singing or a dancers are coming and dancing we go purchase the ticket and attain the program like that but truly if you have to developed in spirituality to go to those people or regularly following that practicing that developing that in their own life this is called sadhana master sitting on the couch cast his benign look on the pendency the observation the wonderful way the master Michelle when Raghavan see Ramakrishna is looking at that gentleman was a great scholar behind them with great love just few days back to the puja is over our senior Swami's is to say that if you go stand before the mother you should pray for the benign look mother I know thousands of their all but look at me with your behinds but a love with a compassion so that look should be there on me so master that is the God in human form I again and again say this because I hundred percent believe that se llama Krishna is the Gordon human form so he is telling that that God one cannot realize God without austerity and spiritual discipline there are many scriptures like the Vedas tomorrow where I am going to participate in when the interfaith dialogue and the topic is scriptures the different there so that in our or the university campus in Chicago so dear there the discussion will be the scripture the Christianity Islam Buddhism Judaism Hinduism all will be sitting discussing about the scripture what is the scripture recovered record of realizations the realized people like the scientist when they find out something they record it that is published for the people scripture is just like that if it is not it's not a scripture so many people they are will learn that people but they were indifferent another traits and after the retirement most of the Indians they like to be the spiritual so they will read some book and immediately generate some party under God Gita or these and that and that is okay they have written problem is ours that they will come and you please sell it or distribute what you have written I do not know keep it to yourself are you satisfied so that is the main question he is Ramakrishna is telling there are many scriptures like Vader's but one cannot realize God without austerity and spiritual discipline what is the austerity we talk about austerity tapasya tapasya tapas tapas tapas in Sanskrit theology what is the austerity constantly withdrawing the mind from the world and putting it back to the God constantly withdrawing our senses that is mine so that is college charity and this is and the spiritual discipline means whatever the guru has instructed by that way one should practice guru say take the name of God in the morning and the evening to them and don't bother about anything else that will help you and this way he says and God cannot be found in the six systems the Vedas very bold words some of the followers of the different religion they cannot even think of it forget about muttering if you say that these and this scripture cannot help you to realize God next moment your it will be somewhere else your body will be other you will be killed immediately because narrowness scripture is not the thing that is helping you to I mean giving you the realization you are going to get the realization how with the help of the knowledge that is recorded over there and this is the broadness of the Hinduism and that is why they say when the one gentleman came and asked the guru there what is the path that I should follow he said see there are two only baracci berapa Raja what is the parameter in Sanskrit term para means the worldly knowledge he is giving the list of the parado some of them you are just making Rigby the zombie the usually the atharvaveda Shiksha canto veteran agenda the rectum Jyoti Sharma tea first reeks Tanya Gioia turbo who is telling a hindu saint to whom a person who is also coming to understand the hindu way of realization and these bathers are ever pieces the art our book on the basis of which the whole hindu this edifice has been built but even they say no salam o krishna he is given wonderful example but one should learn the contents of the scripture and then act accordingly to the injunctions that is important then immediately a metaphor a man lost later he couldn't remember where he had left it he began to search for it with the lamp after two or three people had searched the little was at last found the message in the letter was please send us five saves of some dish and the piece of wearing cloth somebody wanted some sweets and the cloth but that was important because he was the in love from the english house this request came you know in india that is very very important and the in-laws house that is coming so the man ready and through that literally because we need the message that's all so one of the direct disciple so he has a young boy he stopped visiting see ramakrishna and ceramic items in credited boy is not coming now he is now studying baton so what is there no he thinks that come over here talking with you or the wastage of time well glad you asked him to come when he came he asked him what is there in your vedanta brahma satyam jagan mithya what else that is true in the whole scripture that you study and we are sailing over here if you go down on your bookstore and the bookshop so many varieties of books all the down the books and different explanations what is actually there only this half thing what Shankar Acharya saved brahma mahad jagan mithya that is truth brahman is only there and all that you see is nothing but the appearances so greater then reading is hearing he said better than reading is hearing better than hearing is seeing when you are going on reading before but it is better that if you go and listen from your guru what is saved that will be sufficient don't do this time only reading books if you go to any modern society there in the conversation they will surely ask you some of your friends hey what book you are reading now even in the interviews they will ask what book you are reading now to show that you are always in connection with now I am reading this book and that book you have to mention the prominent writers and the present-day writers otherwise you are discarded you are not good for the society what this writing what they are writing in Bengali this is totally Caracara little the same thing you have to the someone was cooking the D never Buddha belly reward is to say Maharaj what is the Tiffin today was to ask used to say Maury and janitor there is that Maura Maura Patrick rice and mana mana and the next day notice that if into the modern model that is then again it'll say who just up was it Moody and Janet Chancellor mone mone until it that means a pretty the same thing only the proportion of the prop tries will be more and this village and this is a little more and that will be little less so same thing will come in this also different people the story books that you read the same thing two three things will happen and nothing else scripture also the same and robot Gita and here it says seeing is far better than hearing master is telling why realization if I see God if I feel that within my heart I need not to bother about anything how long should one reason about the text of the scriptures he said so long as one does not have direct realization of God how long one should read the scripture the moment you realize the god of this efficient we take the map and to reach to some place I have seen that those who are driving they'll put the map over there a very careful about writing the town city and address and everything now they will follow that map GPS and when they reach in the map we find that there is a flag this is the place he already reached immediately put it up because it's not no use there similarly the scripture this is God this is Brahman we reach over there realize then nothing is necessary but you mean we must remember one may talk even after the realization of God why with the Shankar Acharya and others even after realization they are talking the Gani reasons about the world through the process of 1980 friends we were studying the path of knowledge according to Dean to the light of the Salaam additional but Ramakrishna say he said Nita and Leela both are truth at this moment because otherwise you cannot understand now afterwards he said when you then Gani the path of knowledge that you were travelling what process to see made the needy north east northeast or Swami Vivekananda said in his London lecture reverse the process ET ET this this this I love this thing I love this thing I love this thing and the time will come and say I don't want I don't want I don't want not this not this not this in the life of so many people we find so many people and they were grabbing they were having so many things then afterwards they go on giving away why 1980 totally from the mind they have read no I don't want this we drawing the mind and going back in the bhagavad-gita the second chapter 55 verse up to 61 verses seven verses seven or eight verses at the earth where it says the symbol how to understand who is a realized person Arjun asked that question and pressure hearty AHA c'mon sir bond bar Monogue Athan he who has given away all desire and then the 61 versus a Thani ceremony sighing Emma you are see the mud bara and the whole mind constantly withdrawn and at us with me that's all so this is what they say a man who knows that God exists is called Ganon but Kenny is like one who knows beyond doubt that a lava food contains the fire but if he can he is he who lights the law cooks over the fire and is nourished by the food that is the beginning sasame krishna constantly inspiring us to become with Johnny and pundit immediately caught it from Mundaka Upanishad bit that they they can t cheat Dante Salva samsara all the bonds are shattered and there remains no doubt so this is ceramic is near stealing yes ash the parsha Moktar what is that rush departure in next class we will discuss and let us complete with this local Nina and Janet [Music] an entire town gumpa Drita become ye yatha Thorin [Music] but Alicia medium-term Ramakrishna [Music] Sheila Sundy Sundy review that said three Ramakrishna's our eponymous two
