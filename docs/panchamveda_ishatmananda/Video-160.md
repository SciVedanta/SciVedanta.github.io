[161: Panchama Veda 161 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBRkyd1eoJk)

[Applause] today we'll be discussing about a very important approach of the religious people Raghavan C Ramakrishna mentioning over here but before that are usual let us start with this mantra Tabu Kadam written topped achieve annum go be rewritten Col Muharram seven among golem Shri Mata Tom Boonen de bourree dodging Amma the more we read the gospel it becomes really true that it is the nectar Amrit that is giving the solace the joy the love the guidance to a spiritual soul here Raghavan serum krishna is talking with the devotees page number four zero six the gospel of serum vishna date March 23rd 1884 ceramic Krishna was sitting in his room after his midday meal with Rakhal Rao and some other devotees and different type of conversation was going on then afterwards the ceramic Tichenor his men mentioning over here the realization of God is enough for me what does it matter if I don't know Sanskrit so sometimes some people they give so much of stress on that language at this is the devil Bonnie de Ville Varsha if you like to learn you are welcome to learn but for the realization of God note is not necessary one must study the Sanskrit along with the grammar and then only we'll be able to read the Vedas then we'll be able to realize God no it is not so that is exactly what the Gowanus ramakrishna is telling it has nothing to do with that it is about the knowledge many at times he has given the example that you need a map to go somewhere but after reaching to that place to the destination you don't need that map you may keep it for the next generation next people all you may throw it he is giving the example of digging the well the instruments that you have used but for the digging you can keep it or you may throw it because the purpose is served the purpose is God realization this is very important and here in the gospel of ceramic Krishna we find again and again importance has been given on realization of God it's not the learning is not the other ethics that we are following there is only supporting whether you are going to the temple whether you were listening to these whether you are reading this book or not these are all support but the ultimate thing is got realization you must have to realize God that is the ultimate the realization of God is enough for me what does it matter if I don't know Sanskrit then the next line he is telling that is the main point will be discussing for some time for here today the grace of God falls alike on all his children learn it and illiterate whoever longs for him that is the very very special sentence and particularly nowadays when people are confused and a group of people they are Fanning the hatred constantly the hatred is fanned out hit others hit others hit others do you think by hitting others you can realize you can love your own God a completely wrong thing if you have a political motive I have nothing to say if you have something else as a social or geographical historical I have nothing to say but when you are talking about the spirituality talking about the God talking about the practices talking about the realization of God then those things should not be applied that's why the Hmong should be always away from that Shami we began the loved india so much in his the sister Kristin she is writing we started understanding and loving India from him Shama Vivekananda dope way he used to pronounce the word India fascinated us and that show Vivekananda when he established the ramakrishna mission where the ramakrishna mod with the monks dedicated people very clear that no one should mingle with the politics and that is the reason his very famous disciple sister nivedita the Margaret Noble had to write very openly published in the newspaper I am NOT a member of the Ramakrishna mission sister limited wrote why not if you have chosen the path of spirituality a completely different path why the grace of God falls alike on all his children so this is important I cannot discriminate Who am I but the God will love him or not whether God will understand him or not Sri Ramakrishna is giving the example to make it very clear he is telling father has the same love for all his children in the household we find the father suppose the father has five children one calls him Baba son wall and some even can't sleep God it's a path this last cannot pronounce the whole world does the father love those who address him clearly as Baba more than those who call him ba the father knows that these last are simply too young to say Baba correctly so that is the example if somebody is wrong does it mean that I should have to follow the wrong path if somebody is doing some mistake does it mean that I too have to do that the same mistake this is the time that we should ponder we should sit quietly and see just for some temporary benefit shall we spoil the eternal truth that our Rishi is developed and that is giving us the consistency for thousands and thousands of years this is the time we must have to understand these and here I find that that question is God partial if someone says that God is partial he's an absurd question because God himself has created this universe when he said that God is partial he is all the time supporting the rich people learn at people educated people we love people who's wrong you are jealous that is a different thing but don't blame God for that this is valid Gita we find statement of Lord Krishna as the eternal portion of myself having become a living soul in the world of life chapter 15 verses 7 eternal portion portion of myself the God a little portion of the God it is reflected and it has become the living soul of the human and that is the world human life any life that I am arting I am haughty God if some people doesn't understand these that it mean that we have to forget all our scriptures bhagavad-gita we have to ignore the teachings of Shri Krishna and going out others in our scripture there's a provision at itaiy átodayá means the person who is trying to harm you is trying to destroy your family trying to destroy your wealth trying to do something wrong with your wife and children you have every right to kill him there's very clear idea it's not the fighting you can kill him without any hesitation and no scene will occur that is there but does it mean that I will go no that is not and in the chapter 15 and the verse 15 it says surah verse Rajaram tradition nabisco Martha Smith Ayana abou Hollinger not only I am sitting in the heart of each and every being as the sole living force the Artman but I also is the memory and the perception I the God as I am centered in the hearts of all and I have the memory and perception as well as the loss so all this is me and the Manu the lawgiver of the Hindus we find suribabu tisha cha aathmaanam in all being if you have to see the Atman the God sorry boo Bhutan each harmony within the every being you must have to see the God and again all being within God inside God living in the God some emotion at mahadji saw rajim at Eagle jetty they get the moksha the gate the Mukti the eternal teachings of the Hindus and that's why we are respected everywhere and when the time has come to bloom all these years of us subjugated a new flow has come it has been connected every corner of the world people are appreciating the only religion that is ver antha they are appreciating the yoga they are appreciating the way of Hindu shall we make any mistake we should not when someone is crossing our border our brave soldiers should fight them no doubt it doesn't mean the monk should take up the soul the some of the stories they say like that but the real monks never because son of a booty Suja Atmaram in Avery being I see my god how can it hurt it is not possible some emotion at mahadji in the bhagavad-gita when Arjuna went to invite the Krishna the condition that the Krishna gave I can join you but I will never fight I won't think of the arm why I am everyone how can I so that is Summum everywhere I see the same Lord and Krishna the God himself he is in every being but again there are you sir the toes who are very good the God's grace is always with them in the Bhagavad Gita 6th chapter xxx look it sees you mom Piscotty sarvatra sarvam chamoy bisciotti the Siham Nirvana Swami such a Meena pronoun shaadi he who sees mean all things and sees all things in me he never become separated from me nor do I become separated from him Marcia a Domini Devi a Muslim decoyed is to come a low-class low cost as mas 8 my Sharad the direct disciple of sri ramakrishna the student of Calcutta University very bright and what a wonderful life that monk was leading she said my shower he's also my son and this falls my son from emotion no from realization sees aid from the realization only she said he is also my son because there is no difference when a porter in a railway station approached mother as she tamam he came and addressed her as mashita and told ma i am waiting for you for such a long time mother immediately asked him to sit on over there itself just spreading some straw dry straw so sit over here I will give initiation she give the initiation without asking which cost you belong which language you speak which God you worship what type of food is weak she never ever asked about those things never care the love the genuine love for the spirituality for God that is sufficient and we the followers of these great souls we should not make any mistake even any temptation that comes before us we should stick to this spirituality our grade to punish at about which a one of our great leaders Mahatma Gandhi said if eg only said the first local remain Indonesia will remain and that in the issue punish it in one sloka it says yes to Sal Varney Buitoni at Manly we on a pashyati the same paper the Manu also said like that it does it like that sarva bhootheshu cha aathmaanam thatho na vijugupsathe again and again teaching is like that now reigns in the utter gita as they another is not the Veda but it's Asad all scriptures they see yet react Romano yachty Tata Tata param padam wherever my mind goes there my god is residing wherever so how can I say that this is the great and this is secular he is different and he is mine this is very wrong Sager trot Romano ard Tantra doctor param padam doctor doctor param Brahma Brahma sarvatra some Abbas tetum Brahman the highest being the Hindus have conceived have realized he's everywhere sorry Bertram some of us Tetum in the same way the Brahmin is everywhere so this is what is a call in the again I should quote from the bhagavad-gita it says do animal Purusha Lukie shut up cha Akshara a virgin Shura is the perishable one Akshara imperishable both are mean I have made this and very interestingly I was reading in the Bible we find the same idea and the Bible acts it's a teen 34 it says so Peter opened his mouth and st. truly I understand that God shows no partiality look at it God shows no partiality and many many of the followers there is a no we don't believe it we don't read it they of course something which supports their own viewpoint why ego and this acoustic people they are not at all going to God cannot and if we follow them it will be like as in the Punisher they say on the navel near monolith Rhonda this is a blind man leading another blind what will happen both will fall in the ditch on the never near mana yonder a blind leading another blind both of them they go into trouble this is in the Genesis 1:27 it says God created man in his own image again it says in the image of God he created him man and then again he is mentioning male and female he created them so that it gets very clear only milk the God has created only male not the female along earth conception wrong idea the male and female in the Genesis 1:27 it mentions in the Romans 10.12 it says for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek for the same Lord is Lord of all bestowing his riches on all who call on him as much raghavan see Ramakrishna he said looking at the moon in those days you know in our country this - called moon as the maternal uncle mama they're quoting that sadhana Krishna told moon is the mama for all we will call mama moon is mama so if you call God the God is yours so this way it is says that now for there is no distinction between the Chu and clay in those days they were having some trouble with these people Christians are from the Jew only at the Greeks where Romans were there ruling them so there is to consider them as the enemies but those who are pursuing for the spirituality for the ABC no you should not you should not have any difference there because the God has and from the mawashi 2.10 is from the Bible and the same the quotation is printed on that historical book of the history of the Parliament of Religions world religions this coated over their printed over there have we not all one father because it was the Parliament of world religions through the beautiful quotation they quoted from the Bible and printed over there on the top the book is with us it says that have we not all one father has not one God created us why then we are faithless to one another that is the question why we are faithless we were losing faith on each other now suppose one country is developing some power military power another country and the group of countries to go against them and say no stop that because the whatever you are doing is not good that is totally different thing if one country raising the taxes on the materials that is coming from another country and that country also say we will also raise our taxes only your product completely different thing nothing to say they can do it but when they say your religion is different your language is different your food is food habit is different your clothings are different so you are my enemy at least the religious people if they say look at that they do not believe in God so let us go and kill them the religious people so that is the question have we not all one father this is from the Bible I am only quoting I mean Hindu and I find the same word in my book my god is telling also the grace of God Falls alike and all his children so friends always it is Shami we become the same education is the pinaki of all evils all evils what type of education this type of spirit education if we have properly then they'll never be in any head trade so this what they say recently I was watching a movie come Sunday I I see this to understand their culture and also the language the pronunciation American pronunciation so this is a so here I was it is continuing I have not completed that so come Sunday it is acted by kirtan Pierson beautifully depicted the same thing this gentleman he is acting as a father of a church and is a great scholar and also very good speaker and because of his personality many people are coming to that church both the black and white and they were enjoying one day he saw in a TV in a news the people are dying in Africa maybe you have many of you have seen this and when he saw the people dying in it the condition is so sad he was thinking oh my god they have not accepted the Jesus they have not been baptized they must be going to hell thousands of people are going to hell that question wanted him he started fasting and praying to God tell me how can I help them shall I go over there convert them into the Christianity baptized them well how I can help them monetarily I cannot politically I cannot I cannot keep the medicine or my food but at least I can go and convert them into your name then he demanded God has spoken to me and God said they have already been saved you need not do bother about that whatever you are doing you do because any human being anywhere any being anywhere I take care and those people they have come to me and they will leave it me you need not to bother he thought he has heard these and then next day in his son Mon he declared that he said that to create a mall and then the church authorities telling no you are going against our ideology you have to leave who say not the Bible not the Jesus is not the religion but some people who wanted to have their mastery over some people they are interpreting their ego in this way same thing happened in the life of Margaret novel the young lady who afterwards became sister named editor Margaret novel she joined as a teacher and she was very eager to go and help the poor people she never met Swami Vivekananda from his own Honiton from her own nature she thought she will go and there was the opportunity the church was organizing some relief and she's to go in those days the people particularly those to work in the the coal fields this to suffer Lord seems to go and help the children particularly then one day the charge Authority asked hard now you cannot go over there because they are not Christians and not only that even if they are Christian they do not belong to our church maybe they are Christians I wouldn't bother but they do not belong to our church so you cannot go and help is it religion no it's completely irrational and ignorance so wonders worth pursuing for the religion should not be in this type of now Raghavan C Ramakrishna steering I have been feeling much inclined to the neural illa this is 1884 86 he passed away so he is given the hint he never declared that I am the avatar I am the incarnation only every close people they could understand they could feel but still then his to say no you why should you feel like that but now he is given the hint and he is telling I have been feeling much inclined to the neural Allah it is God Himself who plays about as human beings if God can be worshiped through a clay image then why not through a man that the revolutionary sentences not through a man why not but here he is not telling only those who are Brahman only those who have renounced the world only those who are wrong only those who are these and these no no nothing is coming anyone any man that's why Shah me become the worshiped a little Muslim girl in Kashmir as goddess Durga and she saw me become he is worshiping a Muslim girl in Kashmir as Durga so that is Kumari puja he performed were there at the time without discrimination of religion our people should know it this Nara Leela he is talking about Bush never Geron said to me if a person looks on his beloved as his Easter he find it very easy to direct his mind to God this is the conception but that conception created some problem again the some of the people started telling particularly - you know you know you know in those days our girls is to get married very young and when they became widowed where they will go then this type of a Strama so called a steamers is to ask them to go over there another a social problem came and some people this to say think of me as your Ishta devatha is very wrong conception ceramic isne is not supporting that his link i love so and so in the one whom do you love they would ask i love so and so they know him to be your God when I heard these I said to them that is not my way sir Christus telling this is not my way I look on all woman as my mother I found out that the top peak but lead immoral lives that this is the important thing you may talk big but we have to go and see what is your life if it is a modern life and for sure he can never be a spiritual leader and he is going on given the description about the faith and his father was having and the other people the elderly people was having the complete faith a young man of 27 or 28 known as Taku Dada entered the room with a few frames and saluted the master he lived at the bangalore and was the son of a Brahman pundit he is giving the description he used to do the cutta cutta cutta cutta means going on talking about the God in the villages as a conversation in an easy way to teach to the villagers in later villages so that was his preparation is to do like that that is the profession of the Brahmans but this the master is asking him how you came excetera then he's asking have you come here for any particular purpose ceramic is not asking the gentleman and the Dada replied I have come here to visit you I pray to God but why do I suffer now and then from worries for a few days I feel good again why do I feel Restless afterwards this is his personal problem he has come to consult with Ramakrishna ceramic each day is giving the answer in this way I see things have not been fitted quite exactly the machine works smoothly if the mechanic fits the cogs of the wheels correctly in your case there is an obstruction somewhere the obstruction is there somewhere the peace in our past life also we do many things so when the suffering comes somewhere something was not correct something was not properly done so this type of things are coming again the smooth sailing is going on joy respect everything whatever we want everything we are getting a while because again the Karma so it moves in that way then the he said he said that must be so Ramakrishna is asking him are you initiated his essay do you have faith in your mantra this is very important the faith in the mantra the one gentleman rang me and told I like to take initiation from you I will have to take initiation earlier I have taken from me Mataji I don't feel that is helping me so I will come to you I didn't I I don't know having practiced that mantra with respect you have not from now you practice that mantra repetition of the name Gordon name that the Mataji has given to you with respect and see what is the result after 1015 days he rang me again he is now in touch it mean now I am feeling well I think Mataji is protecting me I think God is protecting you Mataji and me and many other gurus that we only connect you with the main source that is God and that God is giving you if you have the good karma no problem that source will come if there is something blocking the grace because of your karma that will also go away if the force of the grace is coming and you are going on dragging the name of through the name of God it will also go have faith in the spiritual life faith is a great thing you have to have that otherwise it is very difficult to make any progress so then a friend of taku Dada they say that the he sings well then the master arts team since the occasion was very fond of music the song he is asking him can you please sing a song then the target that is sang a beautiful song I shall become a yogi and dwell in loves mountain cave I shall be lost in yoga beside the fountain head of please like that one Bengali song you were singing master was very very happy now we have to notice this he said ah what a nice song fountain eight or please fruit of truth laugh and dance and weep and sing your song tastes very sweet to me I don't know whether that Dada could understand what's wrong dish not man that means God was pleased in his son and that boy the young man he sang from his heart because he was not feeling well there was something wrong going on in his life so that bang that thing prompted him to sing or pour out his mind is prayer through that song that touch double God Himself the Lord Himself is Ramakrishna cinema Krishna never said I this time is telling your song taste very sweet to me [Music] it is me is not only Salam peace it is me the God that means he was blessed no doubt why should you worry no salaam tis not asking ever things will be taken care but you do worry so if we go and pray to God with the complete faith that God is listening to my prayer whatever prayer we do God will listen to it and for sure pleasure and Bane are inevitable in the life of the world one suffers now and then from a little beaudion trouble a man living in a room full of shoot cannot avoid being little stained he is telling why should you only if this comes and goes comes and goes don't worry about that please tell me what should I do now now the seriousness answer is chant the name of holy morning and evening clapping your hands and come to me after some time so visiting a place a holy person and getting the inspiration from him that is the main source sometimes when in the in the world we are working and slowly slowly our spirit goes down and that is the reason people should go listen to the discourses of the scripture and once again recharge the battery some of our senior Swami's this to tell like this recharging the battery there is to tell go to balloon Mart recharge your battery and then go again the working field when you go to the working field we are doing this services but again there are so many varieties of things happen in the life sometimes you lose faith sometimes you are tempted for something else and the spirituality goes down is better to go to balloon mod and they have kept the balloon work in the pristine purity that is there early morning at 4 o clock 300-400 wrongs and Brahma cherien's they are sitting and doing the job by seeing that and the holy Ganga is flowing and the Lord's Ramakrishna sitting quietly and no other sound and slowly slowly breaking that Dirk the Sun will raise from the eastern corner and is beautiful if one can understand that and can use that and slowly all his energy will be boosted up again again he can go out and can work so salam o krishna is telling only two things chant the name of holy morning and evening and clapping your hands that will help you come here sometime siamo Krishna is asking him to visit then he is telling the master he is talking with the devotees is the morning when he matures come the Mahima churun is a learned person scholar Sousa Ramakrishna is asking him can you please recite something from the devotional point of view the more immature and said what need is the air to what need is there a penance if God is worshiped with love hey this is a narada pancaratra is a beautiful way if they say if already love is generated within you then other penances are not necessary because we do the penances like fasting getting up early in the morning betting in the ganga and visiting the holy places on pilgrimage all these penances are not necessary when the love for god has come what is the use of penance if God is not worshipped with love again there Narada is putting in a wonderful way if the love has already come the penance is not necessary why you are doing that and if the love is not coming what is the necessary of the penance same way they say what need is there of penance if God is seen we Deen and without if you feel the God within and dog without then what is the use and if you don't see what's the again peanuts so that way that means the goal is to develop that particular attitude faith and love for God that he said and then again obtain from him the love of God master is reciting Serrano Krishna's decided obtained from him the love of God from him each capital that means from God himself as a Narada is telling if the glob is not there where from the LOB will come faith of God will come his from gold itself ceramic kitchen is telling the beautiful story in those days in the stations the stationmaster is to show the light to the girl of the particular train to go away of to stop something and that that type of light was having only one focus our three her clothes the people in the dark couldn't see the face of the person who was showing the light the girl in maybe stationmaster maybe so if you like to see the face of that person who is showing the light you have to pray to himself will you please turn the light on you I like to see you similarly if you like to realize God you need love pure love for God but if you need love once again you have to pray to God for that love otherwise it won't generate so ceramic is nafta listening to that so this is the beauty of ceramic isne my immature an a scholar he quoted from the narada pancaratra but Sri Ramakrishna immediately in a feeler is putting in this way of teen from him the love of God the memories I did another from the Shiva Exeter the Masters telling shame hatred fear hesitation these are the circles what do you say do my image tell him Lok Jagran ah boy these are the the barriers not just green and boy in the name of God if you feel shy then you cannot realize God good luck cha and clean I had tread I don't like these I live like that if you are going on hating others at the same time trying to love others the love on generate why because they in every being God is reciting but again it is it's said when you are star ting the practice you have to seclude yourself and as an example ramakrishna is telling when it is sprouting the Farber will give a good fence so that the animals would not destroy then slowly that becomes a tree it never needs the fence fencing is not necessary that time tree is sufficiently strong to stand so similarly this head trait fear hesitation should not be there sometimes in our lives also we have seen some decisions are to be taken we are organized really our asthma is an under than one organization and that organization sometimes they send out is something you please do this they may add the word please will you please do it in a very nice way they will say but it's the command there's the order you're supposed to and then how to do different type of reaction all these things come and then you have to give up the hesitation it has come from the headquarters that is ceramic each this body this body of sri ramakrishna the shunga so since it has come from there I must have to do that no hesitation go forward do it I can just remember that I was in chair upon ga1 Swami ji was there he is to love me very much the injured shameeka cool Ananda G and this cool chair upon G you know the tribal school the programs and these thing are going on as in our country always the people in the the power they are invited so governor came he was he inaugurated something and then he was watching a cultural program our children student students they were performing program like Shivaji something so of JAL Khan and the Shivaji was fighting on this stage and you know they like the fighting so it was not ending and it was supposed to be one minute it just students they were doing it for a long time and in the meantime Agra culinology he noticed that something is hanging unnecessarily so he thought that should be removed when I talk he told me go and remove that battle but I have to take something some chair or something to climb up then let it be over no no no y-you are hesitating then is coated see see Ramakrishna say if the hesitation is there you won't be able to realize God I I am in charge I am asking you to go and do it you do it what is your recitation people will laugh at you they let them do OB the command know what to do I went from the back sake I took a stool and stood over there and trying to cut that that rope that was from the ceiling it was coming down and these two boys and other also and this Abdul Khan and his group and Shivaji and their group and they found oh this is very good first they stopped seeing me there on the stage and then they found is good that he is in the centre so they started fighting around me and it was difficult for me to come down it was a great fun for the students and those who are observing so like that no hesitation should be there when the senior has given the command I should do it and do it so that is the hesitation from the God and it's for the betterment of the others they must do it and know for sure will be successful things will happen in such a way that you will surely be to the shame hatred fear and hesitation these are the Sacco's then the master is giving this is also very important almost in every page there are so many very important words there are two signs of knowledge how you will know that you realized God the knowledge fast unshakeable booty but these determinative faculty of the mind unshakable with the second no matter how many sorrows afflictions dangers and obstacles one may be fist-width once mine does not undergo any change it is like the blacksmith involved which receives constant blows from the hammer still remains unshaken that is the booty second manliness very strong willpower Nash Rami be vacant and in one of his a talking stealing the more I grow more it seems to me everything lies in manliness the strong determination after analyzing the good and bad pros and cons I take up one idea this is going to be helpful for me and this is going to help the others also which is not only my benefit and but the benefit of the other people around me take up that idea stick to that continue into that so that way if we go Frosty's unshakable booty God is there why Salam krishna saved raghavan see Ramakrishna said God is there you can talk to him you can see him I had no doubt the strong booty I don't bother about anything else the one Swamiji I was going on asking cuz you know that brahmacari so I am reading books and noting down these and whoever the senior Swami's is to come we used to go and to do some personal Shiva do you want a glass of water do you tease do and then used to sit and ask questions when they one day one sharmaji came in up to a tostone and that was a good place so all Swami's is to come over there in a latest and I was asking this question then then then then and ultimately seen see boy I have anchored on one thing after that no question what is that the name of Shri Ramakrishna so whenever there is any problem I just look at Serrano kishna whatever he saved in the gospel of ceramic dish now they accept that as his words so the act is dead where I have anchored my ship I'm not moving anywhere because this why has no aim so doubtful Ness is not good at all doubting Thomas can never become successful they say so this we have to keep in mind to be able to realize God one must practice absolute continence sages like sukadeva are examples that is also one very important thing in the our monastic life that should be there the mind should be constantly on God and on nothing else so this is why see Ramakrishna is telling the we will study the next the wonderful way is telling the other the answers we will read in the next class there's all forever pranaam to see ramakrishna need Anjana medium untrue pom popped on compa Britta become be ish Avatara para Misha medium-term Ramakrishna [Music] she'd asana mama shanti shanti shanti hurry you that's earth sri ramakrishna [Music] our eponymous do
