[132: Panchama Veda 132- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkdgGMV7cRw)

good evening let us begin with this wonderful stotra most of you now perhaps my heart rate Tabaka Tom rhythm topped achieve annum co bvy rhythm calm sharp 'him servin among Gollum srimad artem boovie grinning PE who regard on aha but once the Ramkrishna he was discussion with the devotees and we were reading last time that is called auto b ja ricotta beer ji guru art nobis tuna those who're seeker of the art man for them this discrimination analysis is very very essential those who were seeker of the spirituality of the God realization and the spiritual life for them the discrimination so by turning the mind within oneself one occurs discrimination how to develop the discriminative capacity Bhagwan Shree Ram Krishna himself is telling by turning the mind within by turning the mind within oneself occurs discrimination and through discrimination one thing's of truth so this is very very interesting the yoga and the giana are related we drawing the mind from the senses since all the objects and then taking it inside the mind and then only the discrimination is coming why should I withdraw my mind a saint's object a census from the same subjects here's the discrimination my eyes is going and enjoying as something which is beautiful why should they have to be draw the eyes I like to listen to the praises when their friends and the relatives neighbors they are praising me I enjoy them that those words why should I have to stop withdraw my sense or consensus so that is the question the discrimination comes because there is all temporary those who are clapping those who are praising they're also temporary I am also temporary why then I should spend my time why not try for the permanent one that is the discrimination and see ramakrishna is so specific so wonderful without the discrimination you cannot proceed towards the realization of the artemon and how the discrimination will develop by turning the mind within oneself how the mind can be turned by practicing yoga what is yoga chitta vritti nirodh aha' so see one step by another all are related all are connected and it goes in this way and aranci ramakrishna is telling in the end what is this discrimination what we are going to discriminate it says I do in the beginning Lichter Anita bus to be Vega Paragon near tail in the B vector Romani the sloka number eighteen Shankar Acharya say I do in the beginning me clear that is real which is permanent on it there which is temporary that should be analyzed what is temporary and what is permanent Victor on the bus to be baked of Oregon Yeti we become his discrimination be vehicle on endure the Xiaomi vivica on endure the Devika means discrimination what is the discrimination real and the unreal when Raghavan ceramic is Knox this young boy he was thin not even drink tea perhaps he was asked I will give you the most powerful knowledge austere D the mystical power by getting one one will be very famous and I will give you eight of that dealer to take it and is it by that can I realize God know that you cannot but he will get name fame everything in this world I don't want those things discrimination and that is called discrimination which are of why I want that permanent thing two wives of a sage and the stage she was killing now I should retire I should go inside the jungle and dedicate my whole life in the realization of the brahmana now whatever the property that I am having I like to give it to you 50:51 lady told okay another toll but why you are living it you were a was having the whole thing while you were living because I am going to get the permanent want all that these views that you see there all are impermanent then she said what I am going to do with this environment and what I also want that for which you are living the whole thing so my three the famous one so you give all come I play some bother that means bechara so saddam o krishna is telling that this is the bechara you have to discriminate and Serrano Krishna was going on talking with the devotees we are asking question after question and the neighbor said then why should one call the world Maya why this Christian is coming because when you see fast this world is nothing but the manifestation of the God that Sudama business a and now he are the neighbour is asking then if this is also the manifestation of God this phenomena this world if this is also the manifestation of God then why the Shankar Acharya and the began to say that this is Maya sadhana Krishna said as long as this is very important as long as one has not realized God one should renounce the world following the process of Navy Navy na ET not 1880 mainly Sanskrit word Navy native no negative eating this that this is not this is not this way one should go on why as long as one is not realizing God so one that is the thing that I know God is like these I like to realize God I like to go to God and that way I am going so these all these things that I see and I feel I touch a smell like taste all these things are not God that is for sure so he should but when when I do not when I do not know God when I have not realized God that thing I feel this is not the God so it goes on like this but he who has a teen god knows that it is God who has become all these after the realization then only one can understand all this is also God so this is what is called the knowledge and then he sees that God Maya living beings and the universe from one hole to completing now here's a discrimination the differences are coming that do it wishes that we go Advaita the philosophers they are debating over here the Shankara is killing no it is not this is mainly the followers of Ramanuja this is God is also there and this thing is also the part and parcel of God and Shankara seeds note is the reflection only the God cannot be here and doing the seed God is not here that I know God is completely different we are different we have to go to God that is the philosophical approaches was bhagavati ramakrishna who is the embodiment of synthesis do inka vashisht advaitha advaitha all the philosophy mixed in him and he said this is this suppose you have separated the shell flesh seed and bell fruit and someone asked you to weigh the fruit naturally to weigh the whole fruit you have to take everything the seed and the shell that is not you are not going to eat it but at the same time what is the total weight so this is so that what see Ramakrishna stealing if you have to talk about God you have to take everything only consciousness that is one part of it the same consciousness has become in a wonderful way I mean reflected me all Tutsis twatted even a prophet he manifested it or created it and entered into it as Eve that we also the same it is the process of evolution and involution he is not telling creation so that every Hindu should understand these purple points of the Hinduism it's not creation creation is something which was not before it is evolution and involution it is just projection and again going back inside the film it is already there and when it is properly projected it is coming out so involution suddenly coming out the world after his dissolution remains involved in God and God at the time of creation evolves as the world so I was telling the other day sir our Shiva he is considered as the god of destruction and when he talked about that Brahma the mycological God he is the creator he is creating and then after the creation Vishnu is preserving protecting and then Shiva is destroying the moment we took talk about Shiva was so calm and composed how come that he is destroyed then we talk about he became angry he killed and he danced and he destroyed the imaginary he is not destroying anyone he is not killing anyone it is the total the equilibrium of all the three gunas where the creation means the it is breaking the equilibrium the tranquility is breaking so sattva Raja three and Tama is three sometimes one is more one is less than the creation and when all the three are completely same no creation who can do that each and every one of us all these creatures that we see including the gods we are either good or bad or sometimes in between but the tranquility only in the Shiva there's calm and composed the scepter Raja otama and nothing is taking any shape that is the ultimate that's why Shiva is the great God is the god of all gods Diwali beaver ma they were all this the vitiation are used why because he can control his mind all the time she was sitting so calm so composed even the snakes when they are passing through his body didn't feel that it is a living body like that he is sitting so that is called the Shiva and was that creation means the God is coming out in that way and again it says the phenomenal world belongs to that very reality this is also very important particularly for the philosophers this phenomenal world belongs to that very reality to which the absolute belongs again the absolute belongs to that very reality to which the phenomenal world belongs Cerrano Krishna is repeating in the Frosty's ascending way descending way he is telling the same truth absolute and the phenomenal and the phenomenal and the absolute explained in the bhagavad-gita 13 chapter we find Chaitra Chaitra other yoga that is the name of the chapter Chaitra and Chaitra young one is the field another is the knower of the field what does that feel anything that you see the phenomena and who is the knower of the field the self the God and here in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna Chaitra gamja Pema mom with the survivorship three-issue volatile in everything that you see that you perceive that you feel that you deal that you anything and everything that is there I am presenting that shadow brush III issue auditor Chaitra young I am that consciousness I am that God and all-pervading everywhere and again when I'm here I am also in the seventh chapter of the bhagavad-gita again it says boo me up Oh Anna lobe are you come mana would be watcher the grows and the circle anything that you see the booming discerned awful the water another the fire by you the ear comes the Akasha the sky the space in everywhere I am that is the greatness of the God everywhere when one realizes it how can he be angry with others how can you fight with others obviously that person cannot fight with others criticize others and that is called advaitha bianna not - there is only one anything and everything that you see the moment we think about the one we think all this manifestation I have done something very peculiar is there no Britain is there whatever you see but it's when we look at it after the realization after the realization of the oneness of God oneness of the reality oneness of the consciousness owners of the Earthmen we see God in that in everything that Chaitanya if I am my mentality is not waiting I see the consciousness is every being it is ad waiting the dualist you see his God is present in everything another one see Ramakrishna who was whose to love to call God as mother saw everything nothing but mother that consciousness so this is what he teaches be your mom suribabu Tana again in the seventh chapter attain to sloka of the bhagavad-gita freakishness eight I am the seed that means I am the root of all creation Salam o Krishna didn't read that bhagavad-gita how would he know this the same knowledge almost the language may be a little different but almost the same anything and everything that you see is nothing but God when you go on repeating this mantra everything is God so obviously obviously your mind is going to be brought and you are going to accept everyone in one place Shami Vivekananda he said to his brother disciple he said I don't know whether I have realized God or not but my mind has become so broad I can even accept the Athan that they will if he is there if something like devil is also there I am ready to accept it so that big that broad because it is also part and parcel of the same consciousness say you God God realization means the broadness of God if anyone is jealous about someone criticizing others finding fault with others he's maybe he or she is just proceeding but mostly in the B's is in the very very primary stage of the spiritual life he or she may claim that I'm a monk I'm a spiritual personality I am these I am that but how to prove it this is the proof so you have not understood anything so here Saddam occasionally the phenomenal world belongs to that very reality to which the absolute belongs again the absolute belongs to the very reality to which the phenomenal world belongs he who is realized as God has also become the universe and it's living beings that's a Bhagwan say Ramakrishna's very favourite disciple and as in the Mahabharata we find the Pedulla the great knower of the not earth God and he is transmitting his power to his beloved that is Judas today just before the death badou de was sitting under a tree the King Yudhisthira stupid there and because I looked at him and transmitted all his power in the position it is there it is supported and it is possible it's called son pradana in the sanskrit they call it some pradhana some pradhana means giving away without accepting anything expecting anything giving whole thing some Pradhan this pomp Adana was done by the Battuta to Yudhisthira same thing we see in the modern time Raghavan see Ramakrishna looking intently to his beloved title the neuringer knock who afterwards became xiaomi vivekananda giving everything all power then he's killing today I have given everything to you the Sun pradana so this is possible what is that power this is the power this qualities see tomorrow today in India they are celebrating with the giant e here in America it will be the this tomorrow the Raghavan Lord with the trice blessed day he was born she realized the truth and he passed away on that particular day two tries bliss a day and here a window not a girl also 25th Patricia be shocked as this all the people who are under known to this the little world they are celebrating the windin Artega the very famous wait but he was not ordinary poet he was a philosopher and almost many people the thing after reading his this writing that he was also the realized realized soul and in one place is translating the world today is wild with the Delirium of a trait the conflicts are krill and unceasing in English crooked re-sparked tangle is born of greed all creatures that crying for a new birth of time o thou a boundless life save them rouse dying eternal rise of hope let love's Lotus with it in exhaustible drizzle of honey open his battles in delight sir Raveena Tigger is writing about Lord Buddha when the Buddha was asked what is actually the how it is possible to think about the holiness the Buddha is stealing a seed banana Chi ball Onam Wendy Tom Gypsy Vanner poo Georgia put Jenny on eat them Mangalam Gupta mum is a Poli language you say but in the pronunciation is little different never ever be to those people who are bad people who are thinking evil doing evil the bad type of people who think only about dens of the selfish type of people and creating problem for others always be away from them that is the first teaching of spirituality if you have to develop then you must have to be away from this type of associations the dark bad associations means bad influences bad thoughts and obviously it's not the body is the mind that is affected the mind that is influenced the good or bad so he says a subtle save are those who are bad type of people selfish type of people crooked type of people never ever served them sometimes we go it's okay he or she is just like this but still we go on over there maybe we are having a secret agenda within our mind no you're actually supporting that and that is the reason Siva sometimes bad people they're earning money by cheating others and then the bringing that money to pay to the some holy person if the holy person accepting it that means supporting indirectly that bad action and obviously taking part in that bad action so the Buddha's a should not but at the same time subgenus Ava Bundy Tanja Saban ah such an ax saber those who have good people try to help them try to have their association in whatever weight is possible these are the two things and those who are respected you must be respect to them and he say pooja would journey on arm those were really respected you must respect them don't feel jealous not criticise them without doing anything most of the people we find they are constantly criticizing the religious people they think that all can you leave like that and do that type of work some people constantly will be criticizing the good people or someone who is trying to do good you first go try to do that then only so these are the how a human being can develop this is the and he goes on giving one after another the donnager gamma chain chewy chewy Yun Chu etc and the pali language is difficult to pronounce that is Dhanam and constantly discussing about the Dharma the spirituality either I am listening or I am reading or I am discussing like this if we go on then again and again the impression of the good things will be on our mind I am going on taking the name of God sometimes there is no one there's no book so what to do go on taking the name of God so further one see Ramakrishna is also telling today we are remembering this two great soul who heard the most of the people they will be celebrating today many of you won't understand the bengali but let me read only a few lines from the famous flame of the window not him shy on mata pretty nice mr. redundant gourd ocotilla panthatar lo vegetal Abunda no - not a virgin Malaga couture idiotic Ronni Kot Ranma prawn ah no amrita body because she Takara prema Padma prema but the cheetah module mission de chantier Mukti hey hey ananda bundle Karuna another oniy the lakota column cushioned oh this is a wonderful way if they're even gonna explain about the Bhagwan good and here we find in the bhagwanti Ramakrishna when Salam o Krishna is telling that everything that you see in this phenomenal world is nothing but the God and what is that reality that consciousness that God is also the phenomenal world one knows one who knows the truth knows that it is he alone who has become father and mother child and neighbors man and animal good and bad holy and unholy and so forth you mom Bautista Tata in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna stealing if you know me stuck Tata what is that birth data this and he is a everything very unfortunately those who are following the path of Krishna accepting in Krishna as their only goal and following the teachings above on Krishna misunderstanding many of them I really wonder what you can understand this is simple thing if the God is everything how I can criticize others because I am criticizing another form of God so this what he said God Jesus said once you have seen the Sun you have seen the God so that is the beauty once you have seen the Sun you have seen that God so naturally when you have seen that creation you have seen the creator to a neighbor said then there is no virtue or sink he's a very clever person is good that you have going on arguing and putting some questions so that we are getting the wonderful answer from Sudama Krishna he is telling that if everything is he then there is no virtue and there is no scene now you must listen what is the answer ever wanted ahmadis 'no majority of the people may not understand because they always go with the emotion emotion is one thing but the bechara discrimination and understanding the thing it is true sense it means the D Shakti see Ramakrishna is asked killing they both exist and do not exist the neighbour you may please remember it's asking if there any way if the god is everything good bad everything then there is no virtue and they still seem the whole spiritual world is only of this two thing what you and seen either you belong to God or you belong to Gabel virtue and seen and since the basanta series and the Salam o Krishna also telling in the same way that everything belongs to God the naturally the question comes up then does it mean that there is no virtue there is no same answer of the master is this they both exist and do not exist how when it is to look like this if God gives the ego in a man then he keeps in him the Saints of differentiation and also the Saints of virtue and seen the other day when I was giving a glass in the Hindu temple and this question came this discussion also came the suppose I kill the mosquitoes and this other thing the Flies and all this am i committing sin or not some of the people particularly joins we try to avoid that too very strongly and that's why there will be always with the mosque they put a mask on is their faith this day in hell some of the very tiny thing that is still leaving and the always when they are walking they will be cleaning the dust in front of that there and then they'll be going on walking slowly most of the time they don't walk what were the people society people is not possible so obviously what but the big answer don't go in that way why this is dancer if you think that that is a scene for you the same for you but if you understand that is not same then it is not and he is telling the both exist and do not exist if God keeps the ego in a man then he keeps in him the Saints of differentiation and also the Saints of virtue and sin but in his real few he completely effaced the ego and this ego beyond but you ain't seen good and bad as long as the man has not realized God he retains the Saints of differentiation and the knowledge of good and bad so that for us all this theme but in reality is not support is there and then in between comes the practicality how to survive if you really think like Ramon marshy I'll be like this whether I survive or not the great sage then he will okay but suppose you it is not possible and it is not possible but the millions of people then what they will do so other man in the bhagavad-gita again the Krishna says whatever you per month even after God has become realized has been realized sometimes after the realization of God it keeps in mind of the devotee if he so desires the feeling of the servant ego and the servant of God in that state the devotee says Oh God thou art the master and I am thy servant such a devotee enjoys only spiritual talk spiritual deeds he does not enjoy the company of the ungodly people he does not care for any work that is not of a holy nature then the neighbor is asking you ask us sad to leave in the world after knowing God can God really be known that is the the base question the basic question after all that is telling you are asking us to leave in the world after realization of God but is it possible to realize God is there anything like God now after all this discussion the fellow has come over here doubting the existence of God the master giving very patiently the answer God cannot be known by the Saints organs or by this mind but he can be known by the pure mind the mind that is free from worldly desires should Timon should the ARMA egg raghavan Cyrano Disney's killing the pure lime and the pure art MA our consciousness at the same and what is this pure mind in the Jesus also is a blizzard that those who who are pure in heart but they shall see God he never stayed all in see God is it only pure in heart look at this the teachings of Jesus and cinema Krishna almost 2,000 years difference the thing and here's the Ramakrishna say that you can realize God but not with this mind the mind with all the time thinking about the worldly things if you think with that mind you can realize God impossible but the mind which is completely free from the worldly desires you are here to realize God and how to go beyond this worldly desires what is the order desserts name and fame I should be remembered and praised by the people but great people even they also cannot tolerate a little criticism immediately they are reacting and some are there if you criticize them they'll be taking the vengeance and immediately they will try to carve you and that is the old world is going on like that and if you speak about good words about them even falsely they're very happy so that is called the worldly mind and that is the reason when the worldly mind is their desires at their name fame all the desires ish and I in sanskrit is called Hashanah patrician are between channel Kanchana so Venetian are their desires desire desire and when these desires are going on in that mind can utilize God no it is not so he said pure mind what is the pure mind immediately he is giving the definition analyzing it the mind that is free from worldly desires neighbor who can know God again he's asking Ramakrishna now he is answering the question with a completely different way the neighbor is also asking who can know God that means you are telling that mind without desire can there be any person without desire impossible without desire we cannot survive we have some desire that showing we have taken the party when birth and that is the reason we are surviving and without desire it is is it not impossible when he is asking who can know God to see Ramakrishna immediately understanding what he actually meant he is telling this giving the reply in a complete different ways right who can really know him now he is answer if you see is completely different not that people won't be able to realize God they can they are surely but at the same time is telling can you truly in totality realize God that is answer is giving completely in totality you cannot realize God is telling who can really know him but as for us is doing but as for us it is enough to know as much of him as we need so that is as for us enough to know as far as much then immediately but for us it is enough to know as much of him as we need completely understanding God is the Creator is the sustainer and how he is creating how he is sustaining if he has created why he is destroying all this in totality it is impossible is God is having the form whether the God is not having form or not this is all psychological thing and philosophical things goes on the device goes on but for us a little satisfaction and complete what he was the idea that I'm having if I get that that much I am Sofia happy so that he says right who can really know him in totality but as far as it is enough to know as much of him as we need what need have I of a whole will of water my jar one jar is more than enough for me green one glass of one jar full of water is sufficient for being suppose I have gone to somebody's house and in the night I want a glass of two glasses of water now shall I go and ask do you have the full Tron tank or what is the source of the water how much water containing over there the necessity immediately see Ramakrishna is mentioning giving an example and aunt went to a sugar hill did it need the entire hill a green or two of sugar was more than enough for the end that is the thing we always try to know God with the DS or that if you go the most of the people they are writing about these dad and they'll be comparing study going on what is this instilling that religion is telling what good does it work they say what is the necessity if you would like to be a professor go but if you want to realize God take one idea and hold to that that's all and its neighbor said we are like and a grain of one or two now see Ramakrishna said the typhoid people a type of disease if they're having that disease they always feel thirsty so they usually the doctors they keep away the water from them the neighbor remembering that he is mentioning sir we are like the typhoid patients how can we be satisfied with one jar of water we feel like knowing the old God Master that's true then he is telling but there is also medicine for typhoid and what is the medicine immediately the neighbors what is that medicine said I really like to thank this neighbor because we were going on asking question the whole chapter one of two another wonderful question he was asking and everything is clarified by Raghavan see Ramakrishna what is that medicine this is what see Ramakrishna's austere manga gosh tumor growing in 80 different ways he always everytime he said how to realize God here he said the company of holy mean again and again you said sadhu sanga sadhu sanga sadhu sanga what is the sadhu sanga that we have already discussed and we many of you know that we must keep in mind the sadhu sanga company of holy men second repeating the name of God that's why taking initiation is so important why because we get an idea what to hold on just simply it's like taking a pill and without knowing what actually medicine is containing and how it is going to work within me don't bother the guru has given it the doctor has given it just take it and you will be cured so that he says the company of holy men repeating the name of God and then evade singing his glories and unceasing prayer first is the company of the holy man and then you develop field then you understand how to practice what of the process of practice then you choose the path and then hydrology an idea to go forward first this is called the company of holy men you get all this then you come back and yourself going on repeating the name of God and then finally when you are very happy after repeating the name of God that won't contained you you're singing his glories that is what are the qualities of God those things are automatically coming within us and you were singing the glory and unceasing prayer constantly continuously going on praying to him believing that someday not the door it will be open unto you and again the Jesus the Bible he said knocked the door knocked the door knocked the door I pre pre pre pre one day to be open unto you don't bother what you are praying God Himself will rectify he will send his people to channelize your energy so these are the prayers you should do don't pray in that way and this is the system that you should pray everything will be directed by the God and it says as is the disease so must be the remedy the Lord says in the data of ansan election a or Juna take refuge in me I shall deliver you from all sin take shelter at his feet he will give you right understanding he will take inter responsibility for you then you will get rid of the typhoid can one even know God with such a mind as this can one poor for share of milk into a one-sheet pot can we even know God unless he lets us know him therefore I say pick shelter in God let him do whatever he likes he is self willed what power is there in a man so that is what Bhagavan say Ramakrishna and next the sixteenth chapter page three three zero of the gospel of cinema Krishna so I was thinking we will read that too but only the first para it was Sunday December 9 1883 see Ramakrishna was sitting in his small couch and the master was describing the devotees the exalted state of chaitanya mahaprabhu chaitanya experienced three states of mind first the conscious state when his mind dwelt on the Gauss and the subtle second the semi-conscious state when his mind entered the causal body and was observed in the breeze of divine intoxication third the inmost eight when his mind was bounced in the great cause so that is the three different stages the mostly we talked about and the psychologist also discussed about the human mind is having three different stages jagrip Sapna and the shifty and or sometimes they say is that winking when we are awaited a week we are conscious thinking working and then subconscious mind super conscious mind about the super conscious mind there is not much discussion so obviously the science they don't understand what is super conscious mind they take it in a different way thinking in different way but the spiritual world all is talking about the super conscious mind so the first mind is conscious mind we all are someway conscious about this world our body and our surroundings and we behave like that talk like that and secondly is the subconscious mind when we are sleeping all our dreams all our thoughts all our desires taking different forms they are appearing approaching us it is subconscious mind and then in the subconscious mind also at the time of our sleep there the body is completely unconscious but the mind is active we are developing a complete world you are talking with people mixing with people eating drinking walking and we are having all these type of environments or some other type of environment and we are living in that some of the people they go into that stage we call them mad but what is actually madness they are also living in that world they have a world we don't understand psychologists try to understand that and they try to break that so that they can come out into this physical world the known world of ours but this mad people they go into their own world and leave over there so that is the way they always leave and finally have superconscious the superconscious stain is completely different but windows the roms Ramakrishna is talking about these three states they are completely different you know that this three stages the conscious and in that conscious mind dealt with the gross and the circle that means as we always experience the gross level and when you are sleeping the subtle level that is called one stage mind entered into the causal body there's a root there it enters and finally marched in the causal body with legal for Samadhi so causal body the cause what is the cause we do not it is impossible to express and we keep the name as Brahman a consciousness a God Allah Jehovah Buddha all these we say but we are not very much sure what exactly it is and those who really know it can't express it that is the dilemma unless and until you realize yourself it is impossible to know you must have to know sometimes some people visit is like experiencing depth if you die then only you will surely know exactly know what is there but the problem is you'll be able to express it and if you even if you come down and try to express and people or listen to you so they'll be afraid so like that when you go to that particular causal state if you even come down you won't be able to express it but your gesture posture behavior all that will show that something very special about which people will be curious but they won't know exactly what it is very subjective experience say ramakrishna sometimes he is telling how much i feel to tell you but someone is choking my crowed I cannot so that is the mind merged in the causal state and semi conscious that time mind entered into the causals that we can say sushupti and that in consciousness is there but at the same time body and that mind grows mind absent and that is why we don't see the dream we can't understand anything when you come back only the things is there I was sleeping so happily and of course the present we saw the title nama Prabhu about that he was telling this Maha booth ahamkara booty abduct me butter indriyani the shakin to punch a cha-cha indriya go Chara that is in the bhagavad-gita it goes on telling and the 13 chapter that this is the gross how it is coming some key philosophy win will be discussing in details we will know and the circle again it says the subtle thing punch of prana mana would be the syringe real that is also the circle part of it upon Chiquita butas comes sukshma Gong bogus our denim and the Shankaracharya in the art Mobb order he is telling like this this is the sub Dasha available sukshma shahida when you die the Hindus they believe but these they believe the Sushma sir reader subtle body exactly like this the subtle body it goes away taking all our impression all our thoughts all our desires all our planning a everything goes with us and again we come back again we take the form somewhere and according to our desire according to our Karma Paulo and again whole thing start snowing and in the Bataan tapori washa dear it says the pure consciousness is having three forms no or the conscious or subject Chaitra IAM in the language of the bhagavad-gita and second mindless consciousness associated with the object and third mind consciousness and the perception either we are seeing or hearing or touching as mailing or tasting so they are giving a wonderful example and we'll conclude with that suppose there is a tank full of water big tank with water then through a channel to senses it is going out of the field object and then finally that mind that consciousness that is the water in the example is taking the shape of the field is basically consciousness which is the water and then the water is channeled and reaching to the field and then finally it is taking the shape of the field if it is round or triangle or whatever the shape of the field that mind that consciousness is still began to says this is the three stages of consciousness may be that in our next discussion we will discuss it more thoroughly and let us conclude today after chanting this sloka neden genomic Anantha Lubang of donna combi they become by Aisha wat arum para Misha medium Tom Ramakrishna shear asana mama oh the shanti shanti shanti hurry he'll that's a three dollar Gerstner our eponymous too
