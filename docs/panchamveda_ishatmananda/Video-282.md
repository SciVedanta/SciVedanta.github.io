[283. Panchama Veda 283: One needs the Knowledge Of Reality And Brahman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJC2G_hSUG8)

their devotees and friends this wednesday evening we will be discussing the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavan sirama the devotees they were celebrating bhagavan si ramakrishna's birthday so we are reading that chapter and while talking bhagavan sirama krishna said the renunciation of lost and gold is for sannyasims this is the uniqueness of suramar krishna he never imposed anything which is not supposed to be or is not possible to be practiced by a group of people so if we notice every time he is making two different the practices very categorically for two different type of people one that is the sannyasins another the lay devotees householders now here of course there that time there are no sannyasins were there but vivekananda brahman and all these young people where there were supposed to be sannyas bhagavan siram krishna knew that they will be sannyasin afterwards but whatever it may be in general he is telling like this very clearly categorically the renunciation of lost and gold is for sannyasins it is not for you he was addressing the householder devotees now what they should do he is telling now and then you should go into solitude and call on god with a yearning heart now and then so when we are reading the gospel of sirama krishna and we are learning from bhagavan srirama krishna how to realize god the god himself is teaching us how to realize god how to go back to him how to go back to the swords so he is telling now and then not not that regularly or constantly sometimes when you are free go to the solitude and call on god why we should go to the solitude to call on god not for just spending some time with the friends and and the whole family not like that either me alone or maybe very close friend or those who are thinking in the same way they can go together and can spend some time in the only thinking about god so when you are entering into a holy place i can remember then when we are young our friends we used to go to some holy place then the moment will be at the gate then someone will say among us now we are entering into the temple premises and we should not say anything except about god so somebody will say about the whatever he has read and he has heard like that constantly when we are coming out of that then again we'll be talking about the other things so when we go to the solute then we should talk about only about god meditate only about god think only about god read only about god by that way the mind should be tuned he is telling this for the householders now and then occasionally they should go and he is adding yearning heart that you are call on god with an earning heart that means genuinely not mechanically and when we are thinking that we are losing something and we are in wilderness i do not know where to go that fear will come the longing will come god you are the only one who can save me that type of longing so he is moving going not liking that way the company or the food or any other thing so that is the longing at least for few hours at least for a day that gives a great impetus great advancement your renunciation should be mental your renunciation renunciation of what the sannyasins they are renouncing physically and also mentally they are supposed to and the householders detachment not that they are leaving the heart and home they are living with all their relatives all their friends in the family but at the same time very detached way why they should always know they should remember these are all temporary i was not knowing them a few years before and when i close my eyes when i die i don't i don't know where they will be this is obvious obviously i am not going to be attached i lived with them i liked them they also liked our company and my companion whatever the responsibility i was given i have already performed like this the householders unless a devotee is of the heroic type he cannot pay attention to both god and the world if the heroic tape means and there is a process temptation all the objects of the temptation will be in your front but you are not going to touch it that's called heroic type let there be whatever you like to give it's okay but i'm not going to touch it the tremendous mental strength is necessary for that a little sympathy and little weakness immediately that everything will be ruined so that is why one should be very very careful friends we are talking about the practice of religion you know sometimes we talk about the theory just like the professors they are talking about the advaita vedanta or the guru father so his opinion so that is all theories this is good to know but at the same time if i am genuine i am sincere i like to realize god then i should choose where i'm standing and where i should start and there i must be very very careful because i know my capacity if i am not strong in science and if i try to study the scientific things some subjects i won't get the interest into that and get any good result unnecessarily not only the money but the energy and the time will be wasted after five years although i am nowhere again go back so that is that waste should not be there now i am here and i should try to start from here so that's why sadama krishna is very very practical and human life is very short we do not know what is going to happen when so every day every moment should be utilized that's why he is telling unless a devotee is of a heroic type he cannot pay attention to both god and the world in the world there is a duty the responsibility at the same time a lot of clappings the name the fame and people will be praising you society will acknowledge your and naturally ego will grow up and when you are thinking that these are the things i have done people should remember it you are attached to that in reality that sadama krishna will come to that then the next he will teach us about the reality so the god and this world god is the creator and this world is his creation how he has created completely imagination but it is such a wonderful magic that we are living lives after lives and we are thinking this is real that's a god's magic it's very powerful so obviously it is very difficult to break it and we are thinking no this is all real that's a god and the word and when a heroic person say this world is nothing but god so there's no problem as swami vivekananda for him as sister nivedita mentioned this world and also the brahmana god are the same bhagavan sirama krishna also said that same thing if you can see god by closing your eyes can't you see god with your open eyes why not it's the same thing when you see the waves can't you see the ocean at the ocean and the waves are different this thing but when we reach to that that is the highest the acme of the spiritual life as they say it's so easy to say is easy to write or listen but it is very very difficult to practice so he is mentioning the master is singing about the king janaka lived a householder's life only after attaining perfection through austerity and prayer we come across this name the janaka the janaka was the king and this janaka to whom the great scholars used to come then the munis used to come to listen about the brahma-gyana this is the same janaka so he was always knowing that this world is nothing but at the same time he used to as a king the administration was there see all those things he used to do different type of problems in a human society problems were always there as i was today coming back i was talking with some of the devotees and we remember that when the bharata came back from his maternal uncle's house and naturally ram's mother the kaushallah she was not very happy though she used to love bharata more than rama and rama bharata also used to love her more than his own mother kaiki now the situation changed the rama has gone into exile bharata has come back and kaushallah is thinking it is all bharata's plan that's why he won't be able to fight with rama so he has arranged in such a way that the rama has gone and he has come back now he will be ruling he'll be the king father is also dead there is now he she said sarcastically varatha have you come back good now you can rule without any difficulty this you wanted isn't it started crying mother you should not say like this you know i never ever thought that i will be the king without sri ramachandra no then he started promising if you don't believe my words then i am taking the oath if i am telling the lies if i had any anything in this plot that my mother planned by mistake which i never liked then then he is giving let the scene that comes after killing the woman or an or a child or an elderly person defenseless people so if you kill a defenseless person then the scene that incurs led that followed me there he was telling the sin that usually people incur by not paying the salary to those people through whom he has done the work that means not paying proper salary to the staff or the laborers it was there at the time of sri ramachandra at a time of ramayana can you imagine people are always greedy they always think that if i can save some money money without paying which i am supposed to pay to that worker so that is also a scene and that was there at the time of ramachandra also so when you talk about the ram rajatha that means what all this was there but one should be careful about it and not that at that time there was no scene only at this time that all these things are there not nothing like that all bad works were there thoughts were there scenes were there and good things were also there so sudama krishna is telling you should be brave enough as a king you must be just at the same time you know that these are all nothing this is why i always say the practice of the ramakrishna mission swamis the spiritual practice is very hard apparently they are leaving in the houses and in particular in india if you go as the society at the time could not provide still now they need so swami vivekananda introduced the sannyasis to serve the society and to serve the society we are giving education so orphanages is there schools at their colleges then polytechnic university hospitals dispensaries and one xiaomi will be there the administrator so obviously when you are an administrator when you are giving a signature somebody will get the job when you are signing somebody is that they are fired all these things are there but at the same time 24 hours you have to remember that you are sannyasi 24 hours you have to remember i am only doing the god's job i don't have anything and if you fail in that your sadhana will mar you won't be getting the good result out of that sadhana so this is a very difficult sadhana living under a tree and eating out just begging so easy but here you are getting all comforts all food clothing and every support but at the same time if you are sincere to realize god you have to remember so this is called heroic the last and goal last and local nothing should be there at the same time you are handling the millions of dollar so that is the way you are completely detached you that is what suramar krishna said and he was singing and there he said janaka's might was unsuppressed surpassed what did he lack of the world or the spirit he's in in this that song it is there a shangsha majar kuti is a bengali song they hear they have translated for you for you means the householder devotees he was addressing a particular person for you as chaitanya said the disciplines to be practiced are kindness to living beings jive in bengali kindness to living beings service to the devotees of shiva and chanting the name of god krishna naam that is what caitanya mahaprabhu suggested sirama krishna is also suggesting the same thing three things the householder devotees should practice first is kindness the feeling of kindness to the living beings and service to the holy people good people those who are doing good thinking good you must support them and that way you are also doing good maybe physically you cannot go but at least you are supporting mentally or with some money or some way that is also the support and then chanting the name of god this is the easiest way caitanya mahaprabhu suggested by practicing this three one can purify the mind and can realize god to shudendra and this portion few lines are very important why do i say all this to you shurendra was a big officer he used to work in an office and i was earning a good amount but in the office used to tell lies what to do sometimes it is necessary so why do i say all these to you you work in a merchant's office i say this to you because you have many duties to perform there you tell lies at the office salaam krishna knew all this the you tell lies in the office the merchant naturally you have to say like that then why do i eat the food you offer to me salaam krishna never could eat that he was the personification of the satwika so that is the reason if anybody is thinking something wrong something bad saying something once it has so happened that his very favorite rakhal maharaj afterwards great swami brahmananda he said something to his friend just jokingly which was not truth and a friend sometimes they say hey where you are going no i'm going somewhere something he said it is not mentioned then he came to srama krishna immediately not that he came and discussed about that he could read the mind the moment he entered immediately sudama krishna said i cannot look at your face something some mistake you must have done something wrong you have must you must have done then he was thinking what wrong from the morning nothing i did then he said he understood i told my friend that this only just jokingly the even jokingly you should not tell lies that is silam krishna the spiritual life truth you should not tell lies even jokingly you can't do that but you cannot go to siram krishna the sudama krishna and that sudama krishna is telling to his devotee surendra that you tell lies i know still i accept your gift your food why the reason he is telling because you give your money in charity this charity dhanam that makes a mind pure sometimes some people they'll be doing the this charity after they'll miss you some methods and then they will swindle the money and little portion they will give to charity and they'll think oh we are free from that scene wrong not that now next line because you give your money in charity you give away more than you are that is the point so many of the people and particularly i have noticed in india i don't know in this country but india there are people they'll be earning money by cheating people and then a little portion they will give to the temple and that too you make a big block for that he has given this much money or to an orphanage or to these there and they they think i have given that money for the good cause and whatever the scene that i have incurred now everything crossed i am clean nothing like that so we have to read every line of the gospel of krishna very carefully and here he is telling i know that you tell lies but still i accept your gift because you give money in charity then he is telling you give away more than you earn i cannot eat anything offered by miserly people their wealth is squandered in these ways litigation second thieves and robbers third physicians fourth that weaker children it is like that you're giving money away in charity is very good i was reading in some sanskrit the slokas in childhood days there are a lot of this type of slokas just to you know to make the children they will remember it then afterwards they will understand the meaning and in our childhood days they used to tell this type of thing yes the constantly if you are thinking for the betterment of others when you are thinking about the goodness of others and for the betterment of others he will never be in difficulty that person sampada and he'll be averted in every steps of his life so this is the way it says that about the the dhanam arjuna's question he is telling at least these four karma you should not give up yangya action for the betterment of others charity papa austerity these three these three actions you should not give up because only through this type of action at this type of work one's mind become purified why he is giving so much of stress on the charity he never used to accept anything from anyone but still then he is telling this in the islam religion also jakarta in christianity the donation and the charity in buddhism also they say because you have earned this money and now out of love and not for any other thing you are giving away that money that means your love for others it is generating the more you think about the others more you feel for the others more you sacrifice for the others your mind become purified why the ego will go the ego is the main problem and when you can do that obviously ego will go away but charity or the donation with ego has no result of course the poor people will be benefited but the donor will won't get any spiritual benefit with that way so sudama krishna is clarifying that you're giving money away in charity is very good those who have money should give in charity here in chicago that happened with swami vivekananda and the one very rich man came and naturally he was boasting up and his friend was introducing in the medical the rich person naturally then the swamiji told do you give in charity some of your money why should i i earn with my utilizing my brain my energy and why should i give it to those who are not working for this then swamiji told you are supposed to give then that discussion is all i don't know but obviously he spoke in the line of this as bhagavan sirama krishna said if you are not giving in charity god has given you this gift that you are more intelligent than others capable than others utilizing that you are earning money but if you are not helping the creation of god they are also created by god but if you are not helping them the god will be angry he may take back the gift then what will happen to you after a few days the gentleman came and he said the rockefeller he came and showed the receipt he has given a good amount to a church here now you can thank me rakaphila say to swamiji and immediately swamiji said hey you should thank me because i have saved you from the hell that jokingly he said so this is the way the charity sunama krishna is telling that he spend it for a righteous purpose at kamar pukur i have seen the farmers cutting channels to irrigate their fields sometimes the water rushes in with such a force that the ridges around the field are washed away and the naturally destroyed for this reason the farmers make hole here and there in the ridges since the waters escape through the holes the ridges are not destroyed by such a rash of water the devotees listen with great attention to sadama krishna's words surahindra i cannot meditate well i repeat the divine mother's name now and then lying in bed i repeat her name and fall asleep sirama krishna that is enough you remember her don't you so this is very you know if i have the faith in god sufficient not that 24 hours i should remember if one can do it is good that is the ultimate but for the householders they have so much of other work other responsibilities so naturally the social and the family and many other if they can remember god at least when they are going to bed or in the early morning or in between when they are working that is sufficient and many of the times this happen there there's a beautiful story then about the narada the narada he told the the vishnu lord vishnu i think i am your best devotee krishna to how come i take your name all the time 24 hours so obviously i am your best devotee no one in this world will take your name like me the vishnu told okay that we will finalize we'll see can you please go and see that farmer who is working over there in that field and live with him for some time and whatever he asks you to do and do he went and saw that farmer is working in the right from the morning and up to the night and he's doing so many works because he has to pay taxes and you have to save some money for the future and he has to spend some money for his family and after that only he is when he is going back to bait he is telling the name of lord lord lord please help me please save me i am yours like that and then he will fill us up vishnu came back laughing you said he's a great devotee he whole day he couldn't remember you he was only at the time of going to bed remember then the lord said narada can you please do something for me take this bowl full of oil up to the brim go and go this round come back to me but notice that not a single drop should spill you should be very very careful when you are walking take it in your hand and go so naruto took that and he went and every step he was careful and it was the oil was full to the brim of that container and one drop should not fall and he came back and he said to the lord now here not a single doubt fell then the lord asked how many times he remembered my me and took my name remembering you taking your name is that possible whole attention was there and look at that man his whole attention was into the family because he is a family man and naturally his responsibility even then he never forgot to take my name in the night and you forgot then who is the great devotee so bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling that this is only you take one i cannot meditate well then the master that is enough you remember her don't you ma sharadamani devi i have kept over here on my table and she is mentioning in bengali so someone said that we cannot meditate like that devi they said you take the name of krishna right and do you think that is it ordinary thing just remember bhagavan sriram krishna take his name that will be sufficient this is the faith and when the personalities like maharadamani devi are telling that that means it is the truth so the complete faith on those words is sufficient now and then just remember god and god i am trying to remember you but i am very weak and your this maya this world is constantly dragging me and i cannot control now you should not forget me you should not forget the rabindranath tagar in one of his song is telling if i forget you o lord you sh and close my door please don't go back break the door and come in because they love you but maybe for some reason attractions to the world that you have kept me i may forget judy o amar hiday duar bhandurah so this this ramakrishna is teaching us there are two kinds of yoga mana yoga karma yoga to perform following the guru's instructions such pious act as worship pilgrimage and service to living being is called karma yoga i read again to perform following the guru's instructions such pious act as worship pilgrimage and service to living beings is called karma yoga the duties that janaka performed are also called karma yoga the meditation and contemplation of the yoga is called mono yoga one is physically that you are doing another and through mind mana yoga the contemplation and meditation we drawing the mind our all our saints organs from the sense objects and then pointing it concentrating it on the object of meditation mano yoga and we are sitting still body is not moving only through the mind and the karma yoga visiting the holy places helping the living beings and also the worshipping doing all the good work so that is called karma yoga and mana yoga sometimes particularly those the students of philosophy they know that the shankaracharya he very clearly mentions through the karma only your mind will be purified and you cannot directly realize that that knowledge of brahman so you have to accept the gyana yoga kyano means understanding it's true but the karma what shankara mentioned with with some interest the karma that we used there is to do at those times performing the yankees maybe to go to heaven or those who are not having the children for that or many other purposes mantra shakti that was there and this to do that and it became so popular the shankaracharya had to say all those things that you are doing will take you to particular object particular success but you are not going to get the ultimate knowledge of the brahman but swami vivekananda and bhagavan srama krishna what they are introducing is completely different and our sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita bhagavan sri krishna he himself is telling in the karma yoga any work that you are performing and if you you are doing it for the purpose of god for the love of god without expecting any result out of it result means the worldly benefits that is karma yoga that is sufficient to purify your mind and what is that purification of the mind lessening the ego or eradicating the ego completely immediately you will find that god so god is there i am here in between there is a wall we can say sometimes when it is very strong there is ego or sometimes just in a small cover remove it immediately you can see that so removing the ego but not the self-confidence self-confidence is completely different than the ego so here is telling like this so mano yoga and karma yoga sometimes i say to myself in the kali temple oh mother the mind is nothing but yourself therefore pure mind pure buddhi and pure atman are one and the same thing pure mind now he is using the word pure what does it mean by pure where there is no desire purity is nothing but desire free condition the when there is a desire there is ego and the ego means impurity so that's why bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling that to the mother my divine mother as because the mind is nothing but yourself see this is vedanta nothing in this world can be without that brahman that purity we are only unnecessarily super imposing something on that and thinking in a different way there was a rope i superimposed a snake on that and i am afraid of that in reality there was no snake i superimposed it is my ignorance and then i am afraid i am calling for help is it not funny so in this world also constantly we are thinking somebody is going to beat me or kill me all my mind's creation i am creating my world and who is suffering me so to go out of it who can help your own mind your own thought and nothing else so doctors are helping this type of patients are there the mental agonies mental problems are there on unnecessarily they're thinking it's very difficult to come out of that because it is your their own thinking their own imagination and who can help that's why in the bhagavad-gita very clearly it mentioned i should help myself no one can help me in this world in each and every one around us only try to inspire as guiders and nothing else so that's why it is telling therefore the pure mind pure buddhi and the pure atman are one and the same thing pure mind mana buddhi and the atman it was about dusk many of the devotees saluted srirama krishna and started to go home the master went to the west porch babunath and aim were with him so they are talking master to bhavanath why do you come here so seldom bubble not smiling sad i visit you once in a fortnight i saw you in the street the other day so i didn't come here wait i said naturally master what do you mean what what can you gain by mere seeing touch and talk are also necessary so when the holy company doesn't mean from distance one should see touch and talk the surama krishna was preparing the minds of the young people so he wanted them to come frequently and talk to them and they should also practice that way only it is possible so friends then their master master is giving the descriptions that the evening is approaching and sudama krishna was singing then the girish came as sudama krishna looked at girish his tactic forever became more intense the girish he was an embodiment of faith that's why the sudama krishna's mind went in trance i have surrendered my soul at the fearless feat of the mother am i afraid of death anymore this also that we call it kali kritan kirtan the song for the kali as the that also the krishna kirtan is there kirtan is for the lord krishna and same way the kali is also this ramakrishna it mentioned i have already surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the mother so i am not afraid of death what is death the cessation of the thought and nothing else everything will be there but the body that will perish because the thought is over and obviously that the same mind will go and take another form it may or may not as because sadama krishna is mentioning i have surrendered to the god i have merged with the mother i have merged with the supreme so why should i be afraid looking at girisha name he said divine forward fills my body and rubs me of consciousness the out of conscious the consciousness means they are there devotees are there ceramic instruments to like to talk but his mind goes into that deep meditation this is the difference between bhagavan srirama krishna and ordinary people srama krishna's mind naturally used to go into that consciousness whereas millions of us ordinary people we are trying our best for years to gather only to develop concentration because our attractions for the worldly things our desires are so heavy we cannot release the mind and can that can float to that consciousness this is the difficulty when our desires are there this problem and when we are thinking friends we must be very very careful sometimes we try to meditate and then we start imagining things i saw the light i saw a heart some sound don't bother about that if you are practicing meditation be careful and always follow the words of the guru the best thing is to take the name of the lord constantly where your mind will not think any other else try to stop the other thoughts with the forceful flow of god's name that will help you so this is the way he is telling bhakti love of god is the only essential thing one kind of bhakti has a motive behind it again there is a motive-less love pure devotion a love of god that seeks no return keshav shin and the members of the brahma shamaj didn't know about the motiveless love in this love there is no desire it is nothing but pure love for the lotus feet of god the pure love the motive is love that is bhagavan si rama krishna is mentioning then here also then when sudama krishna is mentioning about that one needs to know the reality of brahman this one line is very very important suramar krishna is talking about the bhakti but at the same time he mentioned these here consciousness means consciousness of the outer world one needs the knowledge of reality and brahman just now we read that sirama krishna mentioned to girish and aim him means the master master the recorder of this conversation the divine forward fills my body and drops me off my consciousness then he said here consciousness means the consciousness of the outer world one needs the the consciousness and consciousness is brahman krishna is so perfect suppose he stopped over there then maybe there was opportunity for the ex people afterwards to explain how could you say that consciousness is rubbed up if the consciousness is not there then what remains it is only consciousness that is called brahman all pervading consciousness that's why he is telling one needs the knowledge of reality and brahman and that is vedanta om kaara vediya the he who can be realized through omkara what is that omkara is meditation or the brahman with the word that one should understand that brahman through this um god om god of idea so to realize the bhagavan si rama krishna to understand bhagavan srirama krishna one should realize brahman because indirectly it is brahman who has taken the human form as bhagavan suramar krishna and when he mentioned one needs the knowledge of reality and brahman are the two different thing friends let me uh say from here in september 12 9 2019 in this gospel of sirama krishna when you are reading the page was english page 582 there also bhagavan sirama krishna was mentioning about the real nature what is the real nature pure atman is our real nature we rate that pure atman is our real nature he never mentioned only atman he mentioned pure atman now what is reality pure atman and what is this pure because in this stage the gunas or the qualities are not manifested purity impurity what is that purity where there is no action how it is possible because there is no desire when desires are not there so there is no action when there is no action so the sattva raja tama these three qualities which are famous as gunas the vedante in the hindus always talk about the gunas and these gunas are in equilibrium when it is in equilibrium there is no action so this way the what is the action when action begins when there is a desire desire is like the the wind that creates waves and the ripples on the water it was pure brahman absolute brahman absolute consciousness all pervading consciousness suddenly as if we are using the word as if we do not know a desire rose in the mind of that consciousness i am alone i like to be many desire the moment the desire came immediately it started taking shape how with the combination and permutation of sattva raja and tama this three qualities again and again mixing in different ways created so pure reality pure consciousness pure atman when that is not there it is paramatma or pure atma again individual self is also known as the self or atman but it is the reflection of the paramatma is the pure atma and what is brahman so what is the reality that we are atman pure atman and that is the reality sirama krishna said one must know the reality this is the reality i am not so and so i am not this body i am not this mind i am not belong to this family or country or religion or or this any uh linguistic group i am atman chidananda that is the atman that is called the reality and what is then brahman here about the brahman it says in the mohanir i'm quoting from there it says yes means he never said it is brahman the moment you conclude that this is brahman this is hinduism they will never give you opportunity to create any question doubt no lakshan this is the symbol of the brahman you cannot say this is brahman you cannot say this is god the moment to say that this is god and conclude about that it is blasphemy it's going against god you cannot limit the god in that way some people they will say oh god only eats this type of food and not that type of food god looks like this and not that god's name is these are not that god can be realized through this pattern not that blasphemy they're against god god is all-powerful and they can say well i like it no problem so sampradaya means a clan a group of people they like to follow that path that particular way teaching no problem but should not criticize the others who are not following that maybe they are following something else so here it says yato bisham samud bhutam know that as brahman from which this universe has been created samud buddha created on which it is resting inna yatan yes mean servant and into which it will merge so that is it will dissolve as if that means everything so that everything is nothing but brahman so what is brahman everything everything has been created out of that everything is sustaining on that and then everything will merge into that so that is called brahman is giving the idea brahman is that which has no limit the limit ma kali is nothing but the brahman bhagavan sinama krishna said in some other place whom you call brahman i call that as makali mother why nobody cheddar if you have seen the photo or the image of ma kali there's no cloth why because she is everywhere this hinduism is mostly symbolic the great idea presenting before you with the symbol and if you don't misunder understand that symbol then it is a really very unfortunate the goddess kali everywhere that's why there is no cloth how you can go and wrap the all pervading consciousness it is it is dark color white dark color because we don't know about it it is infinite eternal and all pervading in it it cannot be defined if it is beyond time as because it is beyond time space and causation then how could you give it a name brahman that that is called the reality is it is there usti they always say how can you say that the brahman is there it is it us or state it is there i can feel whether i am here that you need not to say it is already i can feel that i am here and to mention about it or to teach about eat the knowers of the brahman referred as rita atma para brahma satya etc these are the words they have used because i i am not quoting that particular words because timing is also short because you have to introduce that one and we the human being cannot understand if there is no name or form so something you must have to say about it only when you are realizing it yourself then only you know about it otherwise some of the names have been given what type of name rita rita and satya as a it is also almost the same it is atma it is param brahma it is satya like this is sailing yogavashishta so friends this is what this ramakrishna mentioned the one should know their reality and brahman what is the reality that we are that supreme brahman param atma that is the reality though at this moment we cannot understand about it but we are that is the reality that is the satya that is the truth and what is brahman this is the brahman as because it is all pervading so the rishis in the yoga bashish says has given sam names and these name as rita atma brahma satya but it is all pervading consciousness so today up to this and we will read that's why i have given the name the panchama veda because it is always knowledge and knowledge of the higher spirituality that this panchama veda will study after the next good wednesday again and about the i i will announce one or two things afterwards and let me see if there is any question is asking the sunny question she's asking how should we recover ourselves when we feel mentally tired in brackets weak sometimes some either it this sometimes you have mentioned that you are feeling retired mentally sometimes it doesn't matter that there are a lot of other times are also there so try to recover sometimes when you are tired forget about it take rest and then remember those things remember the very good thing that happened in your life and then once again your mind will be mind always goes like the wave sometimes it is going up sometimes it's going down and if you have read the vivekananda's words he said the more it goes down more there is chances to go up so don't give up hope and spiritual life means constant practices don't give up the practices and you'll be successful ghost is asking samsara is almost full of desires so how to live with unwanted circumstances and how to overcome the desires how do you chant mantra so melodious way so this is another the different type of situations are there in the samsara so that's why bhagavan sirama krishna said it's very difficult so go to a secluded place now and then whenever you are getting an opportunity that as we read and many times he said the same thing detached yourself from that particular situation and go to a secluded place maybe all alone and quietly think about god pray to god with your earning then slowly slowly because the god is the kapal motion as in bengali they say he is the doer of everything when sincerely we are praying all our problems will be removed and the path will be easy to go over there thank you srima vishwas is asking what is the difference between ego and self-respect self-respect of course it is there that is it is not the self-respect is not the ego but the self-confidence ego is completely a different thing ego is mixed with the jealousy and all other bad qualities you know that i always say like this when the someone is telling i only can do it i repeat the word only and that is ego and when you say i too can do it t double o and that is self-confidence and that is self-respect i can do it so you need not to constantly tell the same thing that if you are not having the confidence on me that that is all self-respect the self-respect is good but ego is not shukan is asking the next question how is it possible to keep our mind constant towards god when we live with our family doing all our work for our sansar but this is a very good question you know that everything is nothing but god as we are reading again and again as bhagavan suramar krishna also mentioned so when you are supposed working for that family if you think that this is nothing but the god i am serving that will be sufficient suppose you are cooking instead of thinking that it will be my father will eat mother will eat or uncle will eat think that god will take that that much when you are cleaning the flow or were doing some other things just think that i am doing it for god i'm doing it for god by that way also it is possible so thank you then so let us chant this mantra offer our pranam to bhagavan sadam krishna and we conclude [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] friends the uh this coming 24th uh sunday
