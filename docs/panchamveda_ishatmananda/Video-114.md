this mantra tabu khatam written dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma shop ahom rahbani mangalam srimad autumn boo vegan on te bula dodgin aha in our last class we were reading and discussing about the ceramic ishness own experiences of consciousness a very interesting way he was expressing and then the aims idea about ceramic ISNA mainly the contemporary people they do not understand the other people though that's why I ramakrishna was trying to understand how aim the master moisture who is writing down all his conversation how he is understanding him and he was satisfied after getting the answers then master Masha giving an account the ceramic ISNA talking with the Divine Mother all this we have read last time and we discussed today we will read from the account of sunday September ninth 1883 master Masha is writing ceramic ISNA had finished his midday meal and were sitting on the small couch at page number 284 Rakhal mm means the master Masha and Rutten were sitting on the floor rotten was the steward of the gym leagues garden house and was devoted to the master yoda moldings garden houses adjacent to the dictionary now and then rom chatter Jane hazra passed in or out of the room it was about two o'clock the excellent way very clear way the description of the condition the situation Rutan told the master that a yatra performance by neelakanta had been arranged in jedem alex house inter kata juta Malik was a rich man he was having a garden house adjacent to the dictionary and also he was having a house in the calcutta where neelakanta a famous person in those days he will perform the yatra yet remains in acting something from the life of Shri Krishna and some of the passages from the life of Shri Krishna through songs so that was the wonderful and he was very perfect in that ceramic richness to like him Rutan to master you must go the date has been set Master that's good I want to go nillkin two sinks with great devotion so that is the point cinema marks Sri Ramakrishna he likes only those where the connection of God is there not the only performances the devotion that is there so he said I must go a devotee that is true sir master tears flow from his eyes as he sings and to return he said I am thinking of spending the night in Calcutta when I go to see the yatra because it will be late otherwise so he was telling and return that will be fine rom chatterjee and other devotees arcs written about the 15 jadu more leaks house Rutan yes the golden sandals the deity were stolen from the shrine room in geothermal Babu's house it has created an uproar they are going to try to discover the theme by means of charmed plate everybody will see it in the one room and the plate will move in the direction of the man who stole the sandals the master with a smile how does the plate move by itself nuttin no a man presses it to the ground a devotee is a kind of slit of Han is a clever trick Master real cleverness is the cleverness by which one realizes god this is the speciality of Sri Ramakrishna any chance any talk immediately he will turn it towards God such artery charter e that is the say in the scripture that is the cleverness by which you can realize God this is not the cleverness but anyway in those days we were not having that smart polish and all so naturally people they used to organizing such a way and people were simple and they could understand you know that the story of a gopal part he was very intelligent person and he used to stay with a small Kingdom there was there in the nadia something happened the queen she lost the the golden chain and all and she was thinking how to find out the theme then gopal came and told oh this simple they're all these people who are living in this house i will give them one feed with long stick and they must keep it under their pillow when they are sleeping next day morning it will increase by 2 inches and then it will be formed next day the naturally the lady who stole he went and consulted with a husband what to do has been the very intelligent man told what is there you have stolen now your stick will increase 2 inches they better cut it by 2 each's so when it is increasing 2 inches it will be the same next day when he came then all give the stakes it was less than 12 inches not in this an increased it was left so she was caught so this is the way that these to handle the situation and here we find is a one type of plate it will go to the person Exeter but the master told Sasha Arthur each artery is a very famous sayings of the scripture you must be clever enough to understand how he will realize God so that is the then afterwards as the conversation went on several Bengali gentlemen entered the room and after saluting the master sat down one of them was already known to Sri Ramakrishna these gentlemen followed the cult of tundra the master knew that one of them indulge in immoral acts in the name of religion the tantra rituals under certain conditions allow the mixing of the men and women devotees but see ramakrishna regarded all women even prostitutes as manifestations of the Divine Mother he addressed them all as mother master with a smile where is agile Ananda said Amish needs to give all contact because people is to come is to know them and then accordingly he will talk to them he himself was a cali Poojary he himself practice 64 ways of Tantra and there is a very misunderstanding about Tantra and this year 2016 the last retreat that i will give i will try to bring that actual what is tantra in my other Retreat retreat is on tundra here the tantra actually kashi karate it defines the Tantra as ton means spread and the another is country that means the knowledge it comes the tanya t beast Arrietty Ghanim Anina ET tantrum the definition of the country is tonya t means beasts targethi it reaches out to everywhere what gianna knowledge annina ET taunton this is tantra what is tantra knowledge is going out everywhere reaching out everywhere what is that knowledge there's the consciousness and it's crea are same its activities are same so they give the name Shiva and Kali that is called Tantra the scripture by which knowledge spread is tantra shastra Shankar Acharya in his mentioned tundra in his san koke erica explanation he says spiritual knowledge of the technical nature but is tantra according to Shankar a technical nature spiritual knowledge Tantra is having two pillars what is that is a tattwa and mantra they say three tatra mantra yantra the whenever we are performing that we take the health of some type of designs and that designs gave different type of designs are there gives the knowledge and experience of a mystical senses like the people who have taken the initiation the initiation mantra deeksha is a must in the Contra and when they have taken the initiation the Guru relax them to count the name of the God by hand in and the counting not in a normal way in a mystical way these are them yantras the mantra it helps the science of mystic sound that is called mantra and the tatra science of cosmic principles the tattwa yantra and mantra these are the three things Tantra is regarded as it's true tea or a gamma that is called revelation sometimes the people say only we de no Tantra is also there in the Rig Veda it is there some of the places we the afterwards we will discuss in details it says the beta came from the tanker itself the Rig Veda usually the zombie that it all came from the Yamahas that is called the Tantra there is a it is a part of Tantra is called Bam Margera bhama means left are Chara the practices it is lift hendrik path bhama are Chara but actually the bomb achara means is a retreat the some understand it totally wrong but the bomb achara is based on the profound knowledge it's called return current return current means neighbor t1 is per brick thing another is nae birthday probability means desire thought of mind going out to the world to acquire the world things and that is called probability bomb achara exactly opposite liberty and sometimes we give the explanation if we see that our McCauley the image in the left hand she is holding a sword and a hate shivered hate and the people are afraid to see that the sword is not to cut the head of anyone but to cut the bondages ignorance that's called bama HR obama cali so this salam o Krishna he practiced all this bama Chara is Culebra the-- the reverse process of creating and maintaining the bonds which bounds Jeeva or the soul as a pursue or the animal in the Kali Puja the sacrifice pursue the animal is a symbol actually we are sacrificing all our desires karma brutal over mu Masseria all these partial and they say there are eight parshas news's one is green on a version Lajja a shame by fear shankha doubt chigusa discussed cooler family jati race and sheila the good behavior modesty this is all the austere basha this is very peculiar and then comic row the lower mohammad sergey all these they are also but that way binding us to this world this austere varsha and in the Chandi we find these references these are such to pacha the parsha means the news is that is binding us in this worldly life and what happens if we are bounded to hear it is all temporary so naturally we are enjoying and all suffering but coming again and again because of this and that is the scripture not only way the in the Edit entre shastra in the boise nawet entre I wish never shastras everywhere it is said in the particularly that all Hinduism he says only this way there is only one on his flesh that is called pursue another spirit Sheba if you can cut asunder the partials the pursue then you become Shiva Shiva the auspicious Sheba the eternal Shiva Shiva the joy so the perennial conflict between the pursue and the Sheba that his flesh and the spirit so this is what we find over there and slowly we will find how see Ramakrishna giving trying to give the best idea about this religion where is a challan onda are chillin and a person it took the name of a sannyasi but his practices will was not supported by ceramic ISNA and from his words we can understand he never liked it also my ideal is different from that of a challan onda and his disciples salam occasion is very clear he is no ambiguity and that is called knowledge ah this is my idea we practice this and I am I cannot be compared with that I cannot follow that very clear he says a challan onda and used to say history every woman is a mother to me a children they used to say here now and then sorry Oh chillin I used to stay here now and then he would drink a great deal of wine getting about my attitude towards women he stubbornly justified his own views he insisted again and again why should you not recognize the attitude of a hero towards women won't you admit the injunctions of the Shiva Shiva himself is the author of the Tantra which prescribes various discipline including the heroic I say to him but my dear sir I don't know I don't like these ideas to me every woman is a mother our children under did not support his own children he said to me God will support them I said nothing but this is the way I felt about it ceramic ISNA felt whatever he is now disclosing who will support your children I hope your renunciation of wife and children is not a way of earning money people will think you are a holy man because you have renounced everything so they will give you money in that way you will earn plenty of money is this the way you are earning money showing that I have renounced the world then his steering spiritual practice with a view to winning a lawsuit or earning money or to helping others win in court and acquire Paw Paw Paw party shows a very mean understanding money enables a man to get food and drink build a house worship the deity serve devotees and help the poor when he happens to meet them these are the good uses of money money is not meant for luxuries or creature comforts or for buying a position in society so this is spirituality when you learn the religion will he try to understand religion practice religion these are the guidelines and that is the reason when we are doing it all of us millions and millions of people years together they are practicing but not knowing what actually they should do people practice various tantric disciplines to acquire supernatural powers that's so true even today many people the calm and always they are asking the one thing do you teach meditation then naturally I ask them what is your goal why you try to are interested in learning meditation what is your goal what do you want if you were thinking that by troop concentration you are going to get some supernatural power I don't know I cannot teach you so this is very very clear and you know that as they call it supernatural power tantric practices to acquire supernatural power is called austere cd8 supernatural powers oster CD and they are anima laghima mahima property proc amia bashira ashit wah sarabha comma bossa it waa this all 8 aneema means circle it becomes very very certain those who know the story of ramayana when the Hanuman Hanuman ji was crossing the ocean there's a story that there's someone which was so big you must have to pass through that the mount of that particular being the rock shesha an 1z became so small he just entered into the mouth and came out and the time we took to close the mouth before that or no man she came out so this way the story goes the skull aneema there Xiaomi we wake on the side hanuman ji was not any animal he was a great yogi and he was having all the eight powers anima then laghima very light mahima become big people Aldous be the hanuman ji and all others they came to know Ravana has abducted mah-seeta and she is over there in Sri Lanka Lanka and there is no bridge how to go over there so obviously when they were dejected suddenly someone thought no mana is having all these powers he came to anyone and said why don't you now utilize all these powers for the service of your own master Sri Ramachandra unmon immediately became conscious about his power so after practicing the yoga when one gets all these powers if he is having ego that is dangerous because he is already having so much of power so naturally he should be very very humble and completely free from ego so that he can utilize those powers for the betterment about it when a new mangy were became conscious about his power he thought that's true this is the time i can utilize that power for the service of my master he became very very big there's Kalama EEMA an anima laghima mahima mahima huge and then he gave a jump and property control of the senses when he reached over there and he was moving around then they tried to catch him and they showed him lot of fruits and the description goes he was hungry he wanted to eat but then he thought no why should I I should not take their anything from them he was controlling his senses when he was passing through the palace of the rivanna he saw so many things attract attractions at the air all but he controlled all his senses so it is called property the power to act there everything proc omnia this proc omnia power to acquire everything ana mangy went into the code of the Ravana and the Ravana was sitting on the throne and they were tying him down he was standing over there like a prisoner then he failed no i am the representative of the Lord Rama why should I stand like this immediately he thought I should be on the same level of Ravana his body became big and he put his tail in such a way that he give the lift ass it high enough equal to Ravana the stories the winnie read then bashira power over others no one could catch him that is called besito ah that is the power then issued to a capacity to transmit power we have found that the how hanuman ji he is giving his own power to ramachandran Lakshmana also when they were fighting the rivanna came in a huge the chariot almost from the third floor he was shooting at them now hanuman ji became big again and took them on his shoulder and met them equal so that they can fight also in a same the level so these are the powers that the unwanted was having and when you read the ramen we can understand this is possible suruba comma beside to a ultimate supernatural power the he could do anything when you see the life of Shri Krishna he is lifting the governor with this power servo comma beside wha this type of powers it is possible to see Ramakrishna is mentioning this and they said how means such people are Krishna said to Arjuna he's giving the that but particularly for those who are really want to realize God for them he is giving the caution Krishna said to Arjuna friend by acquiring one of the eight cities you may add a little to your power but you will not be able to realize me after reading if we ask the question then what about you mangy because he was having almost all the eight powers when you read we can understand then is it that he didn't realize god of course he did and when he saw that within his mind only one thing is remaining that is the seed how much under nothing else because his eye that ego was totally gun and all that power that you he was showing he was showing in the name of Lord Rama and that is possible sri ramakrishna himself was having all this we know the story he simply touched narendra not was not believing his words and there is not much time to teach him just by touch it transmitted all power to him he transmitted power to master Domini Davy it transmitted power to all his Dadich disciples this the xiaomi now today is TT puja in Vedanta society here we do not do any elaborate way only to remember we decorate the these pictures this girl advaita none the g the gopal dada days to call him as because he was that by age he was elder than the ceramic ISNA serum krishna to call him baraga Paul this is a elderly Gopal there's another cavalli was also there so Bordeaux Gopal that is the way these two caught and he was so devoted very humble person very very devoted and all through his life he served Marshall a domani devi from the marketing and this thing that thing because my mother was having a big retinue of people so many people every day so many people is to come you have to arrange their food and State ghopal Dada used to help and lot to mirage yogen and the G of course harden and the G so these are the people only days to be all around mother to help her Hoople Dada is to help the mother and very quietly calmly he stood developed in the afterwards when Shami be wakin on the purchase the plot of land by the side of the ganga the balloon wat he started developing the vegetables over there so that we need not to go out of the market to purchase so many young boys they joined as the brahmacari we have to feed them devotees are coming you have to feed them he started at doing that he was very hard-working salam o Krishna is to love him so much and he realized brahmana that is that's why I Swami we wake on the gave the name a treat on and this Gopal Dada the it he became like that they were all having this different type of power but neighbors showed it and never showed it in this way there's a story that the last show me sitting over there in the last row that corner it's called sooo bored on and the G coca maharaj his behavior was just like a child so there's to call him coca as a young boy and he was having lot of pain and used to love drink tea again and again he was having no money so one day he was complaining to see Ramakrishna hey what type of guru eva i am calling on you all the time even by that i don't get a cup of tea nobody is there the to serve me with a cup of tea you had so many rich people to serve now there is no one to serve me when he was going on telling like that I then see Ramakrishna appeared before him that tense Ramakrishna was not in the body it came and Hurst I have to hame Coca you want rich people to serve you i will send so many of them but he will lose me do you want that immediately he got up and jumped at his feet and said no no I am fine I am all right I don't want anything except you so these are the wonderful stories when you read they were having all power but they never showed that is why see Ramakrishna stealing if you have that and the classical that example you can say when nor in dinar the young man he was practicing austerity the Serrano Krishna told him i will give you austere city all this power to you you know why now you can serve the world you can help the people you will get lot of name and fame that young boy hardly 22 years immediately he refused no no I don't want all this all these people ill just clap and I do you think they'll be happy I don't want those I want only the Brahmin the knowledge the offer of the art man knowledge of the Earthman that I want and nothing else salam o Krishna was very happy but Saddam o Krishna gave him lot of power you know that story of swami vivekananda at that time he was in France then Madame calvi in those days they appear a singer very famous opera singer she decided because something happened in our life she decided to commit suicide and disclose that to our frame very close friend and the friend told why don't you go and meet the Indian Jodi he has come to the town he's a and yet by let us go and meet him they went without appointment then knocked the door swami ji was there in that room and then he give the permission they opened the door just 15 Shami she was facing towards the wall he never turned to see who entered the moment they step team he started telling everything about Madame calway you had brought a tempest he said and then he went or tailing what no no one else knew that means Ramsay had that power after capacity here in Chicago when Xiaomi Vivekananda used to sit on a bench by the side of that Michigan lake that that Park a lincoln park he used to sit on a bench and the one mother is to come over there to take some with the physical exercise but her son is to cry the small little baby what to do seeing the xiaomi sitting over there she is to keep the baby on his lap swami vivekananda's may dating the moment the baby was left on his lap he also became quite as long as his mother is practicing and exercising that long the baby was quite some he became the meditating keeping him quiet so these so many things we find that the expression of that power but they were not used for anything else but for the development of the spirituality so the master see Ramakrishna is telling and one cannot get rid of Maya as long as one exercises supernatural power and Maya be gates egotism Shami Vivekananda was not having any go those who have read that wonderful book the written by the mary lee burke the new discoveries there are wonderful examples of these in some place when Vivekananda was getting ready to go to the dyers for the lecture and when everything was aarons the person came and told Shami gee now you please come and he was going there was a meter he was going before the meter looking at him and after two steps again going back to see him in the mirror then the man joked you were sufficiently handsome charming and he said no i am not remembering myself how I will go and give the lecture I'm forgetting myself can you imagine that is Vivekananda and this Vivekananda he was having that power and he was using that power for the development and the manifestation of the supreme power in all beings body and wealth are impermanent why go to so much trouble for their sakes just think of the plight of the utter Yogi's now here cinema Krishna is very clear about that their attention is fixed on one itl only longevity they do not aim at the realization of God at all the practice such exercises as washing out the intestines drinking milk through the tube and the light with that one aim in view longevity there was once a goldsmith now he is giving an example who stunned suddenly turned up and struck to his palate it looked like a man in Samadhi he became completely inert and remained so a long time people came to worship him after several years his tongue suddenly returned to its natural position and he became conscious of the things as before so he went back to his work as a goldsmith all started loving that means all these years though he was being worshipped thinking that he's a yogi but psychologically mentally he remained in the same old position so these are the physical things and nothing to do with God there was a man who knew 82 postures and talk big about the yoga samadhi but inwardly he was drawn two lost and greed that that is the year at stake for a religious person this is the year state is he having this desire for this too if he then you cannot accept him as a religious person he may be something somebody else you may be very good in other things in his other professions so this is the ear stick for a holy person sometimes some people they say I have now reached up to the sixth stage of meditation that means his mind has come and the eyebrow level but if it is so his behavior will change he's simply claiming in that way but his behavior doesn't show that so obviously we do not say on his face but he can understand it is not his completely he'll be two different one Swami after practicing lot of meditation in him Allah he came to the balloon mod he made the great disciples of sri ramakrishna and told i have realized brahman the next naturally they were looking at him Brahma vide bromley bhagavati they all of them they were having their that knowledge they looked at him the understood is not some experiences he has only God as an to test him he said show me shabanam the G said do you feel that that should come again much more of it then he said yes yes I want to get that joy hi nahi hai now I&I you have not realized that you have not realized you have noticed too that once you give that you're completely satisfied and all your doubts will be totally gone abolished that's when the sh t para aburri the moment you see so these are the examples sidamo krishna is giving why he's accepted by everyone in the modern society see Rama Krishna because he is very very true in all this about spirituality and someday we will read from the different quotations of the great souls where they are mentioning about ceramic ich nur just by reading this gospel so many people they have got soul as so many they have understood what real true religion is and this is the real soft sangha sadhu sanga here he said that he is to say once he found a banknote what several thousand rupees he could not resist the temptation and swallowed it thinking you'd get it out somehow later on the note was got out of him all right but he was saying to jail for three years in my guide lessness I used to think that the man had made great spiritual progress really I saved up on my world and he was telling thinking that used to come the gentleman is to come the thing is beyond krishna thought oh he has reached up to that just like a the simple person so that he is mentioning now he is mentioning that someone gives some amount money mahindra paul of CT city is a place he came and he gave five rupees to Ramla salam krishna saw that he is giving five rupees to Ramallah and Rommel told me about it after he had gone and then he was asking suddenly the ramla why this money for for you no no are you sure has he given it for that about the mother mother is to be looking after all the household is it for heart then I am NOT responsible then they know it is for you only then the master see Ramakrishna could not sleep the whole night he was asking the Ramallah to go to that gentleman a return the money to him I don't want any money ramla little the money early in the morning and I felt relieved said you must do something so that I may we might lawsuit once a rich man came here and said to me I have heard of your reputation and so I have come here my dear said I say to him you have made a mistake I am NOT a person you are looking for or chillin on the easier man so he was sending him to that person and this is ceramic ISNA very pure only for God and for nothing else that is the reason Xiaomi began the came over here in 1892 in 1894 he stablished the vedanta society the first indian spiritual organization on the soil of america in new year and we are only 15 centuries after the hundreds of years only 15 centers and if we count our devotees of her followers very very little minut nothing comparing with the other the huge followers if you go to different type of religious organization who have come very recently but they have huge followers why because the baton to society will never leave the path of ceramic ISNA which is true religion but very difficult to understand whether for the ordinary people so they cannot appreciate sometimes some people come and say where didn't you meet it call it a temple why didn't you organize like these then like that that is the problem they do not understand the religion is for something else one gentleman came and were young man his father was no to me from India so he came to help his father told go and help Tommy G he came and told see I am organizing the business over here i am working in this way and kissed etcetera i can give you some advice and what is that advice he said why don't you start the bengali sweets over here sweet shops so a lot of being all is all around they will come and purchase he will earn lot of money I told what about God where sweets will they will purchase the sweets i will get them an end what about the god i will forget that but anyway i jokingly I told see I love so much of sewage where doctor told not to eat so I am afraid to start a switch over here so anyway that way I consoled him and sent them back second and third time also he came and then he reported to his father this show me will never listen to me no one can help you sir so what to do so this is the way many of the people here thinking but the money name fame and all these things are not for the religion we always go according to the instructions of Raghavan see Ramakrishna and he say said you were in a you have made a mistake I am not the person you were looking for it true devotee of God does not care for such thing as well or health he thinks why should I practice spiritual austerities first centuries at work sorry for creature comfort money our name and fame they are all impermanent they last only a day or two this is called Veda this is called knowledge and this is the reason anyone very sincere to realize God to practice religion to approach in spiritual path should follow the advice of sri ramakrishna though it is very very difficult the visiting gentleman took leave of the master of the saluting him when they had departed ceramic ishness smiled and say you can never make a deep listen to religion he understood that they have not appreciated his words they have not listened to it look at it the God Himself guiding sitting over there even then the human being will never listen because karma phala sometimes we think in this way that's why Shankar Acharya in one of his famous retires that be bak Chi domine he said in the second verse and that is mainly the phosphors the three things are very very real and that is one is monisha that lack of a human being the desire to realize God and the third most difficult to get the pauper guide spiritual guide menage a trois mo muk sutra maha purusha some estrella there they got the company of God but they cannot understood and they they could not follow his words the left now immediately see Ramakrishna is asking at turning their discussion to a different way he said what do you think of narendra not in there was that time only seventeen eighteen years old used to come over there as a very young boy but salam o Krishna saw in him the power the spiritual power that is waiting to be manifested no one could understand Saddam Krishna saw he wanted to understand what other disciples are thinking about him the a master Mercia he he is splendid immediately ceramic schmid's was very happy yes his intelligence is as great as his learning besides he is gifted with me in music both as a singer and player then too he has control over his passions master measure you once said that one who constantly talk of his scene really becomes a sinner he cannot extricate himself from his scene but if a man has firm faith that he is the son of God then he makes a rapid stride in spiritual life sri ramakrishna yes failed what tremendous faith krishna kishore had Krishna Keyshia he was a scholar he used to say I have spoken the name of God warns that is enough how can I remain sinner I have become pure and stillness one day helada hari said even a Jamiel had to perform austerities to gratify God can one receive the grace of god without austerities what will one gain by speaking the name of Narayana only once at this remark Krishnappa shows anger knew no bounds the next time he came to this garden to pick flowers he won't even look at ala dari al azhari we know that gentlemen wish to live near see ramakrishna's room hala dairies father was a great devotee at breeding time he would stand west deep in the water and meditate on God uttering the sacred mantra then the tears would flow from his tears one day holy man came to the bedding place in the Ganges at Aria daha re other higher place are near to the diction Asia we talked about seeing him holiday any person has come the holy man Saddam petitions to go to see how much etc so I used to appreciate and sometimes to help them to develop holida he said what shall we gain by seeing the body of a man a mayor cage made of the five elements krishna key sure hard about it and said what did holiday i asked what would we would be gained by visiting a holy man by repeating the name of Krishna Rama a man transformed his physical body into spiritual body to such a man everything is the embodiment of spirit to him Krishna is the embodiment of spirit and he said great abode is the embodiment of spirit he also said a man who artist the name of Krishna Rama even once rips the result of the hundred sod occurs one avisan this is the believe the field the quiche newquay sure he was having the tremendous weight and that is why I ramakrishna liked it now we were discussing about the confidence in the sunday discourse and the faith in oneself the nashik later was having the faith shraddha avi bheja said they entered into him as if that means having the faith faith in the words of the scripture if you think in a good way if you do perform in a good way and if you meditate on god you are certainly going to get great benefit that is the faith unless and until we are having that fate complete faith i am taking the name of God and purifying myself there is no use of practicing religion if the name of God cannot purify me what else and what is the purification again now only two things as again and again we come to these one is flesh one is this worldliness one is this temporary things another is spirit which is permanent eternal these are the two things now i am trying to go towards the spirit the eternal the god that which we call only why these worldly things are unholy because it ties it down again and again we are coming back to this life Ida to enjoy ought to suffer again and again so these are the two things if you understand and then we decide and resolve I am going to go towards God and I don't like to come back again whatever may be the temptations over here in this world I don't want and when you read the history that helps us the great masters and the great kings the great warriors the great heroes all they have gum gum people have forgotten about them so that is the temporary thing but when we think about the Christian the Jesus the Christ Lord Buddha shri krishna Sri Rama Sri Chaitanya Sri Ramakrishna we never forget them there are always there millions of people constantly remembering them so that is the beauty of religion speciality of religion and constantly remembering this holy name of God we are purifying our mind that is what see Rama Krishna is giving the teaching nothing whatsoever is achieved by the performance of worship jappa and devo ocean we doubt failed nothing can be achieved with all these performances worship japa devotion without faith and in the next day again we will continue reading this and we never we are going to a holy place we must concentrate our mind on that he is mentioning over here see some of the people they are in the sitting in the shrine room in there and the women Ares the offering and flowers and make the sandal paste but while doing so the neighbors say what about God he went to a temple I saw all the ladies there working so hard they are making the girl and preparing the flowers and like this the single place because a big program function pooja was coming up but none of them were talking about God all day we are discussing about the what happened salam o Krishna is giving the same example which he saw only today here nowadays the ladies are talking about what shall we cook today I couldn't get good vegetables in the market that qari was delicious yesterday that boy is my cousin hello there have you that job still don't ask me how I am my hurry is no more
