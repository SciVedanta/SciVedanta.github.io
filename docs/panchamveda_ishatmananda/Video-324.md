[325. Panchama Veda (325) - “Sri Ramakrishna in Samadhi.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VROXSxnJaTM)

namaskar dear devotees and friends let us begin the study of the panchama veda the gospel of sirama krishna this is the nectar that it came nectar that is the knowledge which will help us to survive which will help us to go beyond the suffering so that is why it is say amrit we are studying it for a long period of time and every page it is containing so unique wonderful conception teachings and particularly today we will be studying the from the page at 7 7 5 7 75 in the english so there we will find how wonderfully bhagavan srirama krishna is explaining and we will also understand how people behave when they come down from the samadhi we know that discussion was going on to when bhagavan sirama krishna mentioned that everything is possible for god with great confidence he said why because he is the god he knew everything that is why he said in this way everything is possible for god it is he who cast this pill the magician shall lose the knife and take it out again anything is possible and he is giving the example of a magician so this world that we see the world full of joy and sorrow and suffering and enjoyment it's all for us as we are thinking that this one is very real for them it is like that not only that when you are explaining when you are trying to say that this is all illusory the most of the people those who are reading or listening they think how it is possible why because we are all under that spell when the magician is showing the whole audience maybe few thousands each and everyone sitting over there watching the magic are under the spell of that magician and whatever he does they think it as real this is our experience and similarly when the god is doing this world now here is a king and there is a good person there is a bad person there is a hero there is a villain and conflict and so many things are going on and on in everyday life even then [Music] can we understand can we think can we realize that this is nothing but the play magicians game but it is true and when we go beyond that how it is possible to go beyond that to get that experience that this world with everything is nothing but the play of god when we can completely and he let our mind kill our mind change our mind so we will go through this now after this discussion a devotee the brahmos say that a man should perform his worldly duties he must not renounce them so this thing's discussion is last time in last wednesday we have done now the purnu has arrived a master said who told you about our being here this krishna was very fond of this young boy purna and the puna in those days it was really very difficult even for the boys to come out without the permission of the guardians the forget about the ladies girls boys also it is very difficult but even then this boy used to keep track where the bhagavansi ramakrishna is going and whenever he visited calcutta and he used to come and attain that who said then his poorna said saruda sarada is another devotee young man at the time and master to the women devotees give him some refreshments now he is sitting in in the house of the girish ghosh and balaram babu and wherever because people this to know him they wish to lob him and respect him so sudama krishna without hesitation asking the ladies the young boy has come and he is late we have already taken our food if you have something please give him now when the devotees noreen was preparing to sing i i counted this time and one seating he sang ten songs one after another narendra was preparing to sing the master and the devotees were eager to hear his music narendra sang one after another shiva then the song of the sheba then he sang again another song and afterwards the pul2 he was asking won't you sing that one then narendra which one paul two when i behold thy peerless face then the narendra sang as because paul two reminded him to sing that narendra sang when i behold thy peerless face beaming with love oh lord now friends you know many of you those who are very far away won't be able to come but those who are nearby you may try the or there is it is there in the our uh in the website so that is uh i i sang and then tried to explain those songs some of the songs that bhagavan sirama krishna so that is how we pray through song i tried it is a just i try to do that it's really so wonderful when we are praying when we are pouring out our mind into prayer and through songs the narendra he was a young boy he knew so many songs he is singing this one and sadama krishna was in great in deep samadhi he was in great joy at ames request narendra sang again aim and many of the devotees listening with folded hands be drunk or mind be drunk with the wine of heavenly bliss so that is the heavenly bliss so this is the way they all used to sing not in the sand sang again meditate o my mind on the lord hodi he sang another song this universe wondrous and infinite then he sang upon the tree of the sky blaze bright etc he continued at narayan's request narendra sang calm calm mother dole of my soul my heart's delight etc then finally he sang he in his own way as if soliloquizing he is singing only for himself that is a unique song the two lines they have mentioned over here in danes darkness oh mother thy formless beauty sparkles means in darkness and the danes darkness so this is the the ratri shukta that is in the in the uh in the veda there is a sukter that's called from there the conception of goddess kali has come the creation when it is the one who is creating we don't know and as because we don't know that is symbolizes a darkness but from there comes the rupert the form and it is so beautiful as because the one who is creating so we call that particular person or thing or consciousness whatever as mother and the rupa rashi rashi means many so many different forms from where from formless so this if we don't understand it is very difficult to understand the hinduism the hinduism it is mentioning that god is formless and god has created this universe which is of all form so two different way we can approach one is with form another is without form so when it is with form it is also the same consciousness because without that nothing was there and when it is without form that is also it is there so they say in this way in dense darkness oh mother thy formless beauty sparkles therefore the yogi meditate in a dark mountain cave thai yogi dhan dhare hui giri guhavashi in bengali is telling the sirama krishna heard this soul enthralling song he went into samadhi narendra sang again be drunk o mind bit drunk with the wine of heavenly bliss he repeated the song and including this song it was 11 song he sang sitting in one place the master was in samadhi the surama krishna went into samadhi and now slowly he is coming back he was sitting on a pillow dangling his feet so we can understand that is a higher the seat is higher so that he could dangle his feet dangling his feet facing the north and leaning against the wall the devotees were seated around him that this is the uniqueness of mahindra not gupta the teacher the master because he described the whole thing in such a nice way so beautiful way the anyone wants to meditate on this particular scene that particular room has ramakrishna is sitting he's in meditation all devotees they are sitting around him and narendra is singing one after another song and those enthralling it is coming the song means the prayer is so beautiful that is changing the mind everyone into the dead in deep condition meant the spiritual condition they're all enjoying it so this is going on then slowly suramar krishna is coming down the master was in samadhi he was sitting on the pillow dangling his feet facing the north and leaning against the wall the devotees were seated around him in an ecstatic mood sadam krishna talked to divine mother he's not talking to anyone else he's talking to the divine mother now these are the words that gives us so now very important for us because sitting before us someone is talking with the god and this is no hypocrisy this is not drama this is so real and not one time every time this ramakrishna in the life of krishna the meditation and the samadhi and the bhutana the awakening is so natural and normal but other other great teachers we see only once he went into samadhi but for suramar krishna it is just natural as we go to sleep every night it's that way every time anywhere his mind goes up and comes down so this is the rama krishna he is in in an ecstatic mood rama krishna talked to the divine mother he said i shall take my meal now ardha kam has thou found the the lodging the and left the baggage there and then come out he continued i don't enjoy anybody's companion now why should i listen to the music mother that diverse part of my mind to the outside world the sirama krishna when he was listening to the song he was in that mood and then again he is telling sometimes the entertainment also diverts the mind one should be very very careful about that so sometimes we go somewhere i have i have seen the devotee goes on playing the music 24 hours going on the mind is so restless that we cannot stop so some sound should be there and we are thinking oh i am listening to that devotional song 24 hours so my mind is becoming purified no mind is not getting the opportunity or chance to practice concentration sometimes it should be completely quiet silent surama krishna giving the indication to that too so one is entertainment another is enlightenment the surama krishna in every opportunity is teaching us this that you should try to utilize your energy for enlightenment not for entertainment entertainment is necessary for some time but the major the attention should be for enlightenment so most of the time we have seen the people in thousands they will go and listen to the the kritana and kritana means they'll be singing dancing all expression of activities and mind likes that and when you are not meditating then you cannot get anything meditation is necessary caitanya mahaprabhu used to sing the song but at the same time he used to go into deep samadhi that time no dancing no music nothing sirama krishna giving the indication to that and he said that it diverts the mind the master was gradually regaining consciousness of the outer world looking at the devotees he said years ago i used to be amazed to see people keeping koi fish alive in a pot of water now sirama krishna is giving the example from his own life those who were very close at that moment those who were there they were very close to sirama krishna and suramar krishna also knew them so suramar krishna is still talking to them and he's saying see that in the long years long the years ago the sudama krishna was in samadhi then he is slowly coming down then slowly he is almost in our condition so he is talking in this way years ago i used to be amazed to see people keeping koi fish alive in a pot of water i would say how cruel these people are they will finally kill the fish but later as changes came over my mind i realized that bodies are like pillowcases it doesn't matter whether they remain or drop off so when we think we think my god what bhagavatama is telling we don't like to think about the death destruction now that is the reason we always thinking these are all very real so we don't like to destroy it the little girl playing with the dolls and this is a small house and one doll is sitting over here for heart it is so natural practical real and for the others grown-up people they don't mind going when they're going inadvertently maybe they will break that whatever the play that she was playing over there that the building will fall down then the dolls are the falling down and she will cry what you are doing they're all suffering they're dying you have broken their houses for the guru people they you know no you don't just play this game exactly similar way when now the sudama krishna is telling before i used to feel how could these people be so cruel keeping a fish alive and then they will kill then afterwards i understood these are all just nothing but games so this is the realization this is a realization at that level nothing nothing nothing remains only consciousness and only joy only peace only happiness and nothing sudama krishna continuing now bhavanath he is asking naturally the moment ramakrishna said that bhavanath is asking then may one injured a man without incurring sin can one kill him the master yes it is permissible if one has achieved that state of mind but not everyone has it it is the state of brahma-gyana ishwar lava the god realization no easily brahma-gyana brahma means all-pervading consciousness and one who has realized that particular state is called gyana the knowledge so brahma-gyana when one has realized that everything is nothing but the consciousness now one the little the girl when she was playing she is under the spell of that maya that every all those dolls are alive they're crying they're laughing they're jumping they're playing they're enjoying all the whole world she's so engaged into that now another out of jealousy and she is also another girl may be of the same age out of jealousy or sometimes happen then i want to take this doll and she snatches that doll and take away it will be like this when without having the brahmagyana we are behaving that will be called the cruelty but after the brahmagyana all those things won't be there now when the grown up person looking at the game that the little girl was playing for him or for her there's only a play that the game that she is playing it is not that real and truly nobody is going to be hard they are all dolls so nobody is going to be hard when the gyana is there so bhagavan sirama krsna said yes if you kill a person and nothing is going to happen because you are having the brahmagyana that person you think is also the same brahman same consciousness only you see the image and nothing else it is not real we have to understand this point very clearly otherwise we won't be able to understand bhagavan sirama krishna what he is mentioning so he says that yes it is permissible if one has achieved that state of mind but not everyone has it it is the state of brahmagyana by coming down a state or two from samadhi i enjoy bhakti and bhakta now samadhi stage when some of these stage he is coming we will discuss a little about the samadhi what types of samadhi and what happens like that this coming down from the samadhi sirama krishna said that means down means his mind was completely merged with the consciousness when the mind is in that condition it sees no two it sees only one the consciousness no two no duality when there is no duality where is the question of killing fighting or creating problem where is the quest no question like that isn't it there's obviously that particular condition of mind though we cannot even intellectually at this moment understand and naturally a doubt will remain in our mind but that is the true that is the truth that consciousness is there and it has having no duality there sirama krishna is mentioning when i calm down that means from that consciousness level when i bring my down my mind down to this level where i can see duality then i leave another condition what is that bhakti and bhakta bhakti means devotion to god and bhakta the one who is devoted to god and not that ordinary it is not possible after reaching the brahma-yana when we come down we cannot go and mix with other people very worldly people it's not possible sometimes after the educated people it becomes very difficult for them to go and mix and develop friendship and have company with those people who are completely uneducated because the thought levels are not in the same way so they won't be able to converse but those who are not that way com educated and then not having any idea they will talk in a different way and this intelligent person he may say yes no like that but for a long time it is very difficult to continue the conversation so it's the same way we find like this now krishna is giving the example he is telling there exists in god both vidya and abityaa this is again and again he mentioned in many other places also there exist in god we must remember we must give the attention to this particular word in god it's not separate the god is the responsible for bad and good this is the unique thing in hinduism they solve this problem and majority many others are there i want a majority many are there the philosophers and philosophy and the religious paths they can't understand this how god can be bad that is their problem but there is only one existence so when he is creating his imagining only and when he is imagining creating darkness and light otherwise if it is all light then we won't see the light except the darkness how can we compare the light and when it is all darkness that is also not going to function so good and bad light and darkness it should be there then the creation so he is creating and creating with this too the god both maya leads one to god and abid the maya away from him the both are maya maya means power of god but if we had the biddamaya it takes us towards god the knowledge though not complete still under the spill but it takes us towards god and abid the maya so takes us to the world so obviously completely different and what is this knowledge devotion compassion renunciation belong to the realm of biddah both are there so what knowledge what is the knowledge the knowledge of oneness god must be one there cannot be two though if you go to the hindu temple you will find there are so many gods and goddesses so many but still hindus they know actually they are not there for our own benefit for my own benefit i imagine one god or goddess so that i can concentrate my mind and can go through that that is the reason so this is the way we have to understand so why so many gods and goddesses in the hinduism but it is actually only consciousness so they try through one they try to reach to that anyone if you choose because the main thing is concentration to develop concentration so knowledge that god is one and nothing else is there not even this creation not even this world that is called knowledge then we choose one particular aspect of god and we imagine god in that fashion then we concentrate our mind on him that is called devotion then compassion then the when we are under that spell and we see many other around us so we feel for them if we are not feeling for those people then there is no heart at all the dry heart cannot think about god because god is full of love so what is the spiritual life to develop these wonderful qualities knowledge devotion compassion and then renunciation renunciation means giving up when we have the compassion we have the love we have the sympathy we have the feeling for others at the same time if we get entangled i cannot leave without him or her then the suffering so you have to give up now the mother gave birth to the child and the nurse that baby slowly slowly he became a grown-up young person even then the mother wants to feed the milk and then as she used to do when the child was very young kid then what will happen it will be really embarrassing for that young man and it will be really difficult for that lady the mother wants to say i want to show my love my affection to my baby but he's no more baby he's a grown-up person so obviously you have to give up now this much i can do and then afterwards it is so this is called renunciation the more we understand these more it becomes easy for us in the this life i was sitting in one chair in an office i was the boss and then when my term is over i retire i go back and next day again i go and say no i was sitting over there for 30 years i should be there can you do that so now you cannot do that so obviously they will force you then it will be inserted for the person the same way everywhere you have to give up now this body it is becoming old and dilapidated and one day it will die no i don't like to die i don't like to some people are crazy about that and they will do they will spend so much of money even then they will die but if they understand and agree with that the change is inevitable then that pain won't come whatever best is possible i have done so renunciation it doesn't mean that you have to become a monk or a nun not that you have to leave your heart and home all the time only thing the attachment should be given up i was there with my friends my family my kit and cane and they were so kind somewhere of course not but that was the part of life so it was everything was enjoyable if someone is not criticizing not going against then what is the game so part of life is like that people are happy because there is some unhappiness so that is the reason if you understand this then it whole life is wonderful then the time comes i have to die okay no problem no it is time has come i should get ready i should go away so this is called renunciation and it comes along with the knowledge what is the knowledge all these things that we see around us including my body and mind are temporary and everything is changing and whatever is changing is going to be destroyed someday then come devotion bhagavan si ramakrishna said the devotion to god then compassion compassion for the fellow beings i love my god but i hate all these people no that is the reason the lord jesus said love thy neighbor as thyself you have to love those people have to develop love for those which has been expressed over here as compassion what is this compassion because they also just like me they also like happiness they'll also like a family they also live in this way safely all those things are there so i have the compassion whatever is possible for me i always do but i never create problem for them so god and the god's creation both i love so love devotion for god compassion for his created beings and then renunciation finally the god's creation well thank you let it be there whatever god wants to do let him do but i like to go back to the source i like to go back to god that is the reason that is called renunciation and he is saying this knowledge devotion compassion and renunciation belong to the realm of bitta with the help of these a man comes near to god it is not realizing god near to god that means all good qualities are helping a mind to become no mind this is the language ramakrishna will be using one step more and he attains god knowledge of brahma one step more and he realizes god and the knowledge of brahman both the words he's using god realization and brahma-gyana knowledge of brahman both so one step more means then there'll be no desire at all and when there is no desire there is no mind mind is full of desire full of thought and the moment we can kill the mind it will stop the mind functioning we can inherit all those thoughts what remains consciousness so that is the the mind means the reflection of the consciousness and whenever the reflection comes we start thinking that this is happening that is happening that is the thought now all those thoughts are now closed down there is nothing is there when those thoughts are no more no attachment no aversion no sorrow no joy this is tranquil mind what will remain only consciousness so he said one step from there then god realization then sudama krishna is mentioning the these four beautiful qualities knowledge devotion compassion and renunciation with the this four we can go so close to god and then one step ahead one lip and then you break everything all the bondages and you are that so this is the way the beautiful way is mentioning in that state he clearly feels and sees that it is god who has become everything he has nothing to give up and nothing to accept it is impossible for him to be angry with anyone now the anyone that it started one can kill when when we are seeing that this is all imagination imaginary at that time the mind will be i don't see duality i don't see anything else one day i was sitting riding a carriage now sudama krishna giving an example one day i was riding in a carriage i saw two prostitutes standing on a barranda they appeared to me to be embodiments of the divine mother herself i saluted them so what happens when the arjuna is asking this question to sri krishna bhagavan sram sri krishna replied the second chapter at the end prajuhati yada khaman sarvan partha manugatan when there is no desire at all minds become no mind mana amana bhavati and that person the first thing there is no desire then what remains the purity and what is that purity consciousness and what he sees that consciousness is everything the tree is conscious the birds sitting on the tree branches are conscious exactly that happened to that young narendra he saw everything that consciousness and that is the great joy in the beginning he was little afraid then afterwards he was trying hard to realize that and finally he realized that so this is the way sirama krishna is telling that i saluted them not that he didn't see not that he didn't understood that they are two ladies but he didn't see anything except the divine mother so there is only oneness when i first attained this exalted state i could not worship mother kali or give her the food offering haladhari and told me that on account of these the temple officer has slandered me but i only laughed i was not in at least hang at least angry attend brahmagyana and then rome about enjoying god's leela a holy man came to a town and went about seeing the sight he met another sadhu and his acquaintance a letter said i see you are roaming about here where are your baggages so i hope no thief has stolen it the first sadhu said not at all first i found a lodging put my things in the room in a proper order locked the room now i am enjoying the fun of the city after realization when we roam in this world and see the people some are bad some are good some are cruel some are kind you see we enjoy just as we enjoy the movie in the movie there are two person one is the villain another is the hero the villain is always planning all bad things to create problem for the people he's causing the suffering of the people killing people looting people at the same time good people are coming there all these things are going on after two hours when you come come out we are very happy why because we know everything is nothing but imagination at that particular moment it is different we just enjoy that but the back of the mind i always know nothing actually happening so i can sit leaning on the seat and can have the popcorn and can enjoy the movie how why because knowledge what is that knowledge nothing actually happening so this is the way when one realizes god or when one becomes a brahma gyani he sees this world in that way not that the world ceases to be he sees that but in this is the way so bhavana these are very lofty words aim to himself master marsha recorder testing god's leela after brahmagyan climbing down to the ordinary plane of consciousness after attending samadhi so they are all thinking in their own way suramar krishna to aim and the others is it an easy thing to obtain the knowledge of brahman it is not possible unless the mind is annihilated it is not possible unless the mind is annihilated the guru said to the disciple give me your mind and i shall give you knowledge that means you should not think anything else whatever i say follow that in this state one enjoys only spiritual talk and the company of devotees now he is now giving an example he is telling to ram ram was a doctor so he said you are a physician you know that medicine works only when it mixes with the patient's blood and becomes one with it likewise in the state of brahma-yana one sees god both within and without one sees that it is god himself who has become the body mind life and soul so so easy and so simple way bhagavan sirama krishna is giving so so easy what is brahma-gyana that's why it is panchama veda is the knowledge and those who are interested to know about the spiritual life wherever they may be whatever the spiritual path they are following this gospel of krishna is the book they should study sincerely they should study with the open mind oh this is a hindu saint so we don't want not like that but it's bogus only the knowledge we want what happens after realization how people behave after that what is truly god realization how one can reach up to god what are the good qualities that i should acquire to reach god in any sectarian words it's nothing it's not asking that you must do puja to shiva or to kali or to ganesha or to these or not to that nothing like that so this is called the wonderful spiritual teaching that is containing in the spiritual book sometimes i asked our devotees whenever you are invited you take some gift to your that person who has invited you why don't you give them whatever you like along with that a copy of the gospel of sadama krishna let that book be there in his house maybe occasionally they will just open the book and go through one or two pages whatever the pages any page they will be benefited immediately the light will come and sometimes when we are in difficult times in our life this is the book is going to help us why we are so agitated mr life is only this much and everything is going to change change will come let me be calm and let me bear with this and let my mind be completely concentrated to earn these four things the knowledge devotion compassion and renunciation so this is the way if we can it should go and mix with our personality then only it is possible a man attains brahma-gyana as soon as his mind is annihilated with the annihilation of the mind dies the ego which says i i one also attains the knowledge of brahman by following the path of devotion so this is the way the surama krishna is mentioning friends i was telling that the surama krishna came down from the samadhi they hear just those who have already read uh about this our patanjali yoga darshan or the raja yoga swami bibe canada that is the explanation of the patanjali darshan do you know what is samadhi there are two types of samadhi one is called sabija bija means the seed there is a bija there is a seed so obviously the indication from that particular seed again the tree will sprout the saw saw means wheat and bija means the seed with the seed one goes into samadhi and they are having the eight steps and the sabeja that is the yama niyama asana pranayama pratha yama means external internal purity yamanyama then asana is a particular posture of sitting pranayama control of the breathing and pratyahara withdrawing the mind so these then come another three dharana dhyan samadhi the five and three the eight the eight steps of the practice of the yoga now the first five are the external so you are now bathing you are now practicing the mantra repeating the mantra so by that to be externally and internally you are making yourself pure those who people come over here to take initiation we always ask come after bathing put on the washed clothes and come in a fresh mind that's all external then when they come and sit before me i say do this do that think in this way think in that way so that you become internally purified so external and internal purification yama and nyama then we give the the seat this is the way you must see it and then the pranayama how do we draw the breathing control the breathing and mind should be withdrawn one step by step it goes on then comes the third bharana tarana means holding the mind in one place then dhyana concentrating the mind on that particular object and samadhi merging with that particular object so dharana dhyana samadhi the sabeja is also known as sabi kalpa now different names have been given for this particular condition samadhi the same is known as sabrikalpa saw means with option what is the option i can come back i can come down so saw bija with seat saw bikalpa with another option and also sampragyata the saw means again that wheat and ganta knowledge to be that another knowledge so sabija and sabi kalpa samprakyata this is a one type of samathi and for these i need a support and what is that support better to meditate on god than to anything else because if you are meditating on a holy person then you are getting all the good qualities of that holy person within you if you are meditating on a bad person that's why some people they go on thinking about some bad people they harmed me they did so that is also one type of meditation the more and more and more you go on thinking the ones they insulted me once they criticized me once they harmed me like this like that you are going on thinking of the bad people and those bad qualities will come to you because you are concentrating your mind so it is always better to think about the good people and the holy people and then you can get the all the good qualities of those people and there is another type of samadhi that is also the higher what is that nirvija nee means negative so means positive with and knee negative without the nerve the bija means there is no seed so no seed at all or there is nothing to hold nothing to concentrate no object to concentrate needy and that is also another known is need the same with three different names three three six names but the two different types of samadhi what happens this nirvija all these eight quali the practices that we do we do externally here for the savija the five or external three are internal what are the three internal daruna dhyan samadhi the where i am going to merge into my god because i am meditating on my god and i merge into god that is the first step those who become perfect into that then automatically they go to the next one that is called nirvikalpa asam pragyata nirivija or what happens over there no one can say when sudama krishna is a bhabha samadhi bhabha abhishta so he was in meditation he was in samadhi so bhabha means in the particular thought he is completely merged or bhabha abhisheta abhished also the same the word abhishta means fully transformed into that particular bhava bhabha means the thought idea so into that idea into that thought he is completely submerged that's called bhabha vista now another word they say bhutana bhutanam is waking from that state and at that time the samskara the impression that is there in my mind that all slowly slowly come up that's why bhagavan si rama krishna we see we have we read this in the the yoga book but we see that practiced manifested into the life of bhagavan sirama krishna in the sabja samadhi samadhi he goes into that samadhi and then he comes back he went in samadhi with the help of the mother makali so when he comes back but another terminology buddhana means breaking that samadhi coming back to the life that we live started all the thoughts coming back but at the first thought mother because he was meditating on the mother and he talked with the mother have you taken food i am going to take food with the mother so for us why it is how it is possible because his mind was into that then he comes down then slowly he is talking with narendra and all others so a man attained brahma ghana as soon as his mind is annihilated with inhalation of the mind dies the ego and says i i one also attained the knowledge of brahman by following the path of devotion so this is a new thing in bhagavad-gita krishna the most of the people the thing the brahma-gyana the knowledge of brahman can be achieved only by following the path of knowledge but surama krishna says sure but through the path of devotion also you can why that supreme god whom you are meditating and praying when he comes and gives you the darshan that you can see him talk to him and suppose you say oh lord i know that you don't have any form i like to see you into that condition also please bless me so that i go to that without form only consciousness all pervading that brahmagyana also i like to enjoy the god can give so this is the way bhagavan sirama krishna in a beautiful way he is mentioning and he's mentioning that those who are following the path of knowledge they say not these not this in sanskrit it is not this not this and those who are following the path of bhakti devotion they say eti eti this is my god's creation everything that i see is nothing but god so this is this is but the way we reach to the same goal thank you friends and we will start in our next reading in our next wednesday from here thank you is asking what should be our attitude towards a mistake and should we reduce them towards our mistake and how should we reduce them so actually this is the you know that this decision so we make mistake again and again because we are very weak naturally so that is very natural but then we understand that this is a mistake that i have done and i then i have to take the resolution and in the path of the knowledge the very fast step that they say is subha subha means suba holy icha desire or resolution i take the resolution that i am not going to repeat this bad habit then after two three days again i commit the same thing then again i have to tell my mind no i should not repeat it i should not do it and i should be constantly aware i should not repeat i should not do that i should not do that then one time it will slowly go away the mind is nothing but an impression and when there is no impression slowly slowly you will forget so by that way you can place yourself you can help yourself you can become the friend of your own mind just by taking a strong resolution i am not going to repeat my the mystics thank you rishikesh is asking does god give us desires and also take them away of course the desire comes god has created desire and god has given you the intellect to understand that god has given you the teacher god has given that scripture now what is our within our mind it is there it comes down from our the different karmapala so desire is ours though it was there created by god but god never asked us to do that if you have read or heard the story of the kathopanishad nachi keta they're also the god the yama he was offering so many things and you can take all these beautiful things that the gods they enjoy ima rama sarathas no human can think about these wonderful the things of enjoyment you take it and what he said no no no i don't want that i want the knowledge only so desires are there whether i will accept it or not it depends on me and that is the reason you need to read the scripture properly you need a proper guidance follow the path of the holy people and strong the resolution i am not going to be bound by any desire then only the desire cannot bind thank you common chord is asking is the minds come down again to another state where all these things are there that the the fear of death and etc all this comes back but not so prominently though because once we get the knowledge we know it is but still it is there so that is the reason that someone he has got the green card visa from america he is supposed to come back but when he goes to in the country india or outside then maybe there is a fear oh suppose they cancel this then what will happen the status i may not get i don't like that like the fear is there at the same time green card means oh there is a no there is nothing wrong wrong you can come back at the same time fear but if you become the citizen of the country if you have the passport of that country then there is no problem so similarly just i am giving the example the same way when you go to the nirvikalpa samadhi there again and again bhagavan srama krishna is mentioning and hellation of all the desires nothing remains completely it goes away there all these two will never be there so nirvikalpa samadhi can give us this dr alpuna kosh is asking please tell us what is astra siddhis so at this moment uh when i i can because it's a long discussion and we are already late the ashta siddhi anima lagima the mahima and all these are there maybe some other day if the you know discussion comes we will discuss on that so thank you friends so let us conclude by repeating this mantra niranjanam is [Music] namaste
