[129. Panchama Veda 129 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrqQyaqLJb8)

begin with this sloka tava khatam madam dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten calm asabam 7 among golem shrimad otha tongue booby grinning da ba dee da jana so we were reading the last visit to cache of data that was the chapter here in the conversation Raghavan see Ramakrishna contributing a great knowledge in the bead on the movement that we will come and we find over here in the page 320 he is mentioning the primordial power and the supreme Brahman are identical you can never think of the one without the other they are like the gym and its brilliance giving the example one cannot think of the brilliance without the gym or of the gene without its brilliance again it is like the snake and its wriggling motion one cannot think of the riddling motion without the snake or of the snake without its prickly motion so this is the example so simple statement is one sentence only examples are too but that clarifies the whole thing about the creation about the Creator about the material about which they were asking if the hour Ricky Vader they were asking the students they were asking out of which this universe were built everything has been completely answered different philosophy expressing this fact in different ways breathers no benicia is a very famous of ownership on the basis of which so many other philosophies have been written and most of the mongs they will obviously read the breeds are on yoga Kenisha the super Nisha is like a huge forest sabria are on yoga what he said in one line God's rishta Todd Eva oh no provision tah-dah toggle switch to earth that means this universe sister after creating toward Eva into that uh no provision he entered into that who the consciousness whom the Hindus have given the name but on things they call as Brahman the Brahman the consciousness entered into the creation he created he entered into that as if otherwise we cannot explain how these inert being the human body can have the consciousness we can feel we can express we can do so many things how it is possible the last Sunday when we were reading the materialistic philosophy of the charvak errs or the loci of the darshan they are they say when different things are coming together the four they mentioned the poor things shitty of a teacher and by you nut Malta so when the four things that combined something because of their mixture something is coming up and that is consciousness and they give the example in the upon leave a bit early and that battle and the oars call the line they usually they use the three together and they chew each individual items are not having the red color but when you mix three and you radius the color is coming this is a mixture because of that similarly that is their argument but Britain of polishes it is not possible consciousness is completely different thing cannot come out of the inert thing from unconscious thing consciousness can never come so it says when that inner thing that was created the universe was created into that entered the consciousness Todd the switch to our the diva a new provision after creation Brahman entered into it and here again the jojoba sister they explained in a different way yoga vasistha completely a very high voice the philosophy Serrano Krishna is to read this and cinema Krishna used to ask narendran are the young Vivekananda to study that also but he used to refuse at that time he said killing me as God it is the screaming one should not read this type of bull then to inspire him ceramic is nice to say you need not to read you only read out for me I want to listen when a person is reading automatically he is also getting some idea that narendra not became a great with our Dean and this they say you gob assist explain what is creation is nothing your mind is creating and when there will be no mind this new creation say simply they say cheetah nah she nuh samsara cheetah nah she win the your mind which is having all the impressions of these universe of this world of the human being of the animals of all these varieties of creation whenever you are looking at that you are creating and suppose that mind is absent it is not this there is no creation so they gave in simple chit to nashik na samsara when mind is absent world is also nil what is also absent and then we'll give the example kubinashi nuh cumbersome come from means the picture the arcane feature when that ardent feature is not there then naturally there is no art in picture when it was there it was there when it breaks Kumba narshe when it breaks so no nothing is there so it is just like that you are creating and when creating with your mind what your imagination when your mind is not there there is no creation yoga wash is chris kelly again yoga vasistha goes one steve agee dances so muslim kalpana Mottram edem be Xuan this universe is nothing but the imagination summer stump everything Kalpana Mottram imagination what a dumb beasts be shown this universe now if you say like that how many people will be able to understand and if we say like that how many people will be able to make their life daily almost impossible but that is the beauty of Ramakrishna is contribution to this particular philosophical gibbet confusion even now so many people will be telling that this world is completely illusion it is true but to whom that is the question whatever they in the ordinary people who cannot imagine that who cannot dream that this is an imagination for themes Ramakrishna is giving the reply and that is a wonderful way he is mentioning he who is Brahman is the RDR Shakti the 321 page of the gospel of Ramakrishna he said he who is Brahman is the objective here the whole problem is solved at the ascertain what is the subjective primal energy rd so primal Shakti is the energy at they're shifty the primal energy when inactive it is called Brahman the salsa Ramakrishna's own realization and in the beautiful way he said when enacted it is called Brahman the purusha these are the words is not creating it is already there in the phoenician in the Veda the pool sure the Brahman when inactive he is called Brahman the purusha he is called Shakti or prakruthi the same thing is called Shakti orthography when engaged in creation preservation destruction Christy TT / liar these are the three work that usually they do when it is done and who is doing it is called property is called a dr Shakti the primal energy but what is this primal energy he is again is killing this purusa and prakruti he who is purusha is also prakruti both are the embodiment of bliss this solves all problems the people are confused when you say this world is completely absent and all the philosophies after reaching over there the Philosopher's or the realized Souls after reaching over that they say it is not there it is all our creation that's true but what about door Denari people Serrano Krishna is a God of the modern age he understood that these people if they won't understand it it is impossible for them so for being he's telling these world he's also made of God completely God created by God out of his own we created and that is why afterwards his disciple shawnee Vivekananda he introduced so forcefully the Karma Yoga the Karma Yoga that we find in the third chapter the Bhagavad Gita and also explaining in the fourth chapter and again in the eighteenth chapter it says again and again so much of stress has been given by the Lord Krishna on the Karma Yoga because it is the precursor it is the nature we can never stop that but if we utilize it properly that energy of that nature for the benefit of spiritual upliftment same work everything can give us the guidance and why we can do that imagination note realization what is the realization whatever we are serving whomever we are solving is nothing but leaving gods and from this point of view after visualizations business ad if you can see God after closing eyes can't you see God with open eyes beautiful so wonderful and Shami Vivekananda in a very poetic way he is telling the moving to her knuckles the moving temples the Taj Mahal of all creation human being and my special object of worship is the poor the downtrodden the inlet adopt rest very strong words revolutionary statements the people don't allow some people into the temple and they think they are spiritual their religious they forget this is the truth the Bhagavad see Ramakrishna he is mentioning like this and again we find over here that most difficult philosophical question who is the creator and what is the creation is solved on the same page see Ramakrishna declared why humans spatial in the creation that again we read from here why human is so special in the page 2 321 he says after the realization of God he is seen in all beings what is the symbol what is the taste what is the proof that one has realized God this is the after the realization of God he the one who has realized that God is seen in all being he sees God in all being the moment we say that is not God and this is not only that he should not come know it for sure he has not realized God he may claim he may show the certificates but this is the ultimate trust but his greater manifestation is in man again among men God manifest himself more clearly in those devotees who are shocked dick sees how he is giving so simple explanation so wonderful way first is after the god realization one is supposed to see God in every being because that is the realization that is the truth God is not just an image or a light or a sound or something very peculiar no nothing like that it is a consciousness that is present in every being that knowledge is absent this moment after the realization of God we see every being the same thing and that is there Marshall is imani de vida concert of advanced Ramakrishna failed don't find fault with others why because everything is nothing but the God the moment you were hurting someone criticizing someone you are hurting the God insulting God so he says in that way and among all the creation men are the best among men God manifests himself more clearly in those devotees who are Shakti and that is the reason those who are really very high in spiritual level they become Shakti what type of rustic 18 chapter of the Bhagavad Gita speaks about the qualities of the shaktra in many other places up there but many it has said the main thing is he is not a test at all that is the quality of a shot Toa not attached it with anything with these worldly things at us to only with God and nothing else that is shot to a guna and when he is constantly or she is constantly thinking of God at us with God and not caring about this world what happens he never feel jealousy he never feels angry that that is the satwa guna I am NOT explaining that sattva-guna right this moment but in the eighteenth chapter it has been explained among the main God manifest himself more clearly in those devotees were shutting in those who have no desire whatever that is called schwate where can a man of shah mahdi raised his mind after coming down from the plane of Samadhi now see Ramakrishna giving and a hint and he will explain it in purely why he used to love rock al-nour in August there should not be any question these people should not misunderstand but some of the people they already did it is the shorter those whose mind is already in the somali when he comes down and for the case of ceramic is nate was so natural just like breathing used to go to Samadhi and next moment he comes down behave like the ordinary man again he goes to some other it was just like that and now naturally we can understand for him he wanted to keep his mind on those now someone who is a poet so obviously he wants to have the company of the other poets do not understand poetry do not like this poetry never heard about any poets or the raid any whims if the weight goes to talk to them you will bore up to some time and like that many other professional people if they find the same type of people they can easily discuss about that otherwise it is difficult so a man of Samadhi who is after the Samadhi coming down for him this world has nothing how he will keep his mind on the software so he said why this sattva means they are also not attached to this world they have developed that quality where can a man of Samadhi rest his mind after coming down from the plane of Samadhi that is why he feels the need of seeking the company of the pure-hearted devotees endowed with the Satwa and free from the attachment how else could such a person occupy himself in the relative plane of the consciousness but once I Ramakrishna those who have read the back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] and see Ramakrishna came to see that Keisha but after entering into the room we are reading that he never incredible the health of the kisha who is the doctor what are the medicines how you're improving what are the problems nothing like that they were talking only about God master Masha has given the subtitle of this chapter as last visit to Asia what do you mean by last visit to Keisha Keisha will pass away after these and see Ramakrishna the God Himself on this earth is helping his greatest devotee though he didn't follow his own teachings but as because the man was true to his religion to his believed to his face and he was practicing religion sincerely the God has come to help him to make thing understand and he is telling this is the whole thing the creator's a Brahmin because why he is selling Brahmin because the brahma samajis they used to believe in Brahman only and the Brahmin with qualities of course as salam o Krishna is talking about the Brahman immediately he introduced the primal energy a deity and then he narrated the image of God is cali that Kali is nothing but the same understanding that this man deception the same one of the founders of the Brahmo Samaj a famous leader of the from Brahmo Samaj and who actually traded this message of brahma samaj he said it is quite true while talking to Ramakrishna he never asks these people are wondering the neighbor asked a single exchange s single word about the health Saddam o Krishna to Keisha why do the members of the Brahmo Samaj dwell on so much on God's glories now again here is giving them slowly the right track is there any great need to repeat of such thing o God thou has created the moon the Sun and the stars most people are filled with admiration for the garden only how few care to see its owner who is greater the garden or its owner so that is Ramakrishna and he shall I tell you the truth now he is killing Keyshia because they all the time of the time of Prayer o God you have given us the deliberate they I think were influenced by the Christian prayers and from there they took those things you have given us the daily we breathe you have created these clear created that only to think that is a great person is not nasally where the faith is there the God is the creator he is my father he is my mother why all the time you have to tell like that you know it in yourself who is my mother who is my father who is God so that is what see Ramakrishna no doubt about it and no distance from God shall I tell you the truth man loves his own riches and so he thinks that God also loves that too why they are explaining so many things because they love their own reaches and that is why we are also thinking in that way I was seeing with some of the pictures it came someone forwarded that a is a wonderful building with 100,000 crow the building was constructed by a person now he is acting from India he was a so rich man and his building and there's some of the pictures they have given they wanted to sell state bank of india so they were sailing and nobody could give so much of the cause they have someone has but chances simply as usual to sell they are giving the pictures my god so beautiful house from the the bedroom you can see directly the sea as if it is all the sea and all that it's okay for some time and suppose you are all alone inside that room do you think that you will enjoy that nature no a few days usually go with that same beautiful nature but you need some company you need other things also that is the speciality of the human being the only a beautiful place and some food cannot satisfy they need also the mental peace happiness joy the intellectual understanding and growth all these things this shows again and again so futility of this world and see ramakrishna is telling shall i tell you the truth man loves his own riches and so he thinks that God also loves that he thinks that God will be pleased if we glorify his riches once Zhang who said to me Shambo vu he wasn't very rich man a landlord Ramakrishna's to like him shambhu baba is asking see ramakrishna and what was his prayer please bless me that i may die leaving my reaches at the lotus feet of god so that was his prayer and see ramakrishna answer these are reaches only to you what reaches can you offer to God to him these are mayor Dustin straw all a piece is called spirituality understanding the truth and then proceeding to earth the truth once a thief broke into the temple of Vishnu and robbed the image of his jewels motor baru the landlord of the section Asia and I went to the temple to see what was the matter at dressing the image motu said bitterly what a shame Lord he was so what pneus the thief took all the jewelry's from your body and you couldn't do a thing about it thereupon I say to mature shame on you how improper your words are to God the gels you talk so much about our only lumps of clay Lakshmi the goddess of Fortune is his concert do you mean to say that he should spend sleepless nights because a thief has taken your few rupees you must not say such things can you ever bring God under control through wealth he can be gained only true love what does he want certainly not wealth he wants from his devotees love devotion feelings discrimination and renunciation and here we find almost the same thing Shankar Acharya in his famous book Vivek to Romany the sloka number 82 he says Mukesh akanksha a debate about t TR jati do not be shy on Vishal miata fuchsia but tozhe daya shamma or java prashanthi don t Raja nicktim agarrar if you have the desire to get liberation moksha Concha comes amiss desired moksha liberation you devoid of asti if you are having then Piazza OT duerod you must give away all these from the worldly object and practice compassion forgiveness simplicity or jebem and peace the shanty prashanthi so these are the good qualities if we can develop and that is called a spiritual person the spirituality is nothing but accumulating imbibe in practicing some wonderful qualities like this and all these qualities come only when one can understand the futility of this world the very very temporary nature of this world nothing remains one of the great writer chief Nam ship not and he wrote and the first day of the new year usually people to celebrate and he has written why you are enjoying that this new year new year it is only for one year if the new year will remain only one year the next day again after 365 days again either you are here will come so that is true you always think the new year but it is all is only one year so that is the way we have to understand it's called discrimination and void arghya be vehicle by raja and again in the bhagavad-gita that famous loca that we all know that God Himself the Sri Krishna himself is telling care about the wealth all the wonderful food that you're different dishes you are preparing I only want your devotion you love your concern for me and in a beautiful way he expressed in that ninth chapter of the 26 local he said Bertram push pom-pom too young Buttram means the leaf push from the flower from the fruit to him the water but Trump ashram polym torium you mean Akhtar prayer chapel God ahom bhakta operatin ashe na minha Praia da da da whoever makes an offering to me with devotion that is important with devotion be it of leaf flower through the water I accept it with joy so I have told you before that when we go sometimes and the young people we don't understand when you go to perform the relief or whether the natural calamity some big problem then the ramakrishna mission warszawa changa they always go many other organization they go and then serve these affected people a group of young people in the regs almost in the beginning of the ramakrishna mission we all wind and distributed some blankets clothings to the suffering people came back and they were reporting to the first general secretary show me saravanan the g and swamiji we have given these they have given these we have given day he was asking what you have given and naturally he was confused then on again and again i am telling you the least what are the things we have given then he explained that those things came from some other people from rich people they donated and you have carried those and deliver lead to some other people who are poor rich people gave and poor people god you only carry so it what is your contribution like just as a carrier as the post office somebody entrusted the post office to carry that and then they delivered like that then he said you must give the devotion with that the living gods were suffering over there there are living gods they don't need anything I have got the opportunity to serve with great devotion you are giving that is your contribution and that is sloth big contribution that is the way one should do sometimes some people to suggest that we can also do some here in America mostly they do some cooking and they give it to some organizations of the earth and then they will distribute and cooking and distributing and all that we are not directly going and sometimes people they go directly whatever but what is the main idea oh they are suffering so you should give government is taking care now other major things are also there as a spiritual aspiring what is your idea that is the question as Anna spiritual aspirant if you even give only one dollar but give with devotion that helps you to develop the spirituality we find over here the Vagabond the Ramakrishna and he is explaining then all this and he is telling that can one even bring God under control through wealth no one looks on God exactly according to one's own inner feelings now he explains see this is the the beauty of the gospel of ceramic Krishna all our questions are answered some people they say why this sacrifice eyes the goals before the goddess Kali this is very very bad system and ravine Donna Tiger has written a drama over that so this is a continuously people they wick resizing oh this is so bad so bad salam o Krishna is giving him this complete idea is explaining one looks on God exactly according to one's own inner feeling take for instance a devotee with an excess of Thomas we know dama sub two are a jerk these are the three qualities excess of Thomas eating's that the Divine Mother it's goat so he slaughters one for her because he loves to eat that meat and saddam occasion in one class is telling one person is to offer the goat every year before the goddess Kali Puja now suddenly he stopped and the people live around the villages this to come and get the Prasad so this to enjoy that now they started asking cell what happened why you are not offering the gold have you changed to the wish novels and not was no no no no I don't have peeps nowadays so that I don't offer that means he wanted to eat so he was offering the goat so this is the answer because you can never stop it unless and until that person develops his own mind of spirituality for him it is very much true that I am offering to God and God is eating I am also eating because gamma sig nature of that person then he said again the devotee ended with Rogers he cooks live and various other desus for the mother if you go to some of the rich family you will find 75 different items offered to the monitor and they'll be boasting we always offer 75 different items and never replicate all new items or new dishes so that is the edges but the swap tech devotee doesn't make any outer show of his worship people don't even know he is worshiping if he has no flowers he worshipped God with mere Ganga water and the leaves his food offering to the deity consists of sweetened puffed rice or a few candies occasionally he cooks a little rice pudding for the dainty it is only the devotion and nothing else whatever you eat whatever it may be if we are offering it with great devotion sometimes when the they are offering they show so many things signs you have a geography history it is to use only the years amid a like this they'll be this with the fingers they'll be showing all this gesture if you can't do that you cannot offer food to God who say and sometimes some people will be telling the particularly the Hindus if something happened somebody has passed away in the family or new birth at least for one year or something like that they owned offer food to God why no this someone has why this people is to ask me can we do the worship or offer food and yet have you stopped eating if you have not stopped eating like unto offer food to God he is our own when I can eat how he will leave you will find that in every night that they are putting some clothing sonsa Ramakrishna wife in the night it will be so he needs that covering though it is a picture and we are offering the fruits and we are offering the insensitive though it is Abaddon to society little bit of that but idea is we don't think this as an ordinary picture you think as a living consciousness in the name of Provence see Ramakrishna so friends thank you very much for the today's evening and this is the punisher movida this is the all knowledge it has passed through higher and higher stages of knowledge in a so simple language sometimes people they are very fond of reading brain steep and difficult type of scriptures and sometimes they won't be able to understand that we even then they read what is my pot purse wanted to read those books to become in scholars okay that is alright but to become and spiritual aspiring and to realize God why should I waste time in reading all those things if I can have time okay if the teachers are there listen but the main purpose is to transform my nature from the Tomas from the satwa and to the from the Rogers to the shaft wha show me Vivek on the same you where animals now you have become human being try to be God the complete sucker and that is realization of God and God in every being as consciousness and he is not only above somewhere he is everywhere in every being because the same God has created the universe like me everyone so that is the teaching of other 10 mo Kieschnick and after the realization of God he is telling us this thing let us offer our pranaam conclude need engine omnium on the roof um popped on compa dita bikram boy yavitt arum para misha
