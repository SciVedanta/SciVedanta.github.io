G vanam Kaviri little calm asha seven among golem three madam booby clean Andy a gory dodging our serum Krishna was talking with a very close devotee Mahima jaren Chakrabarty he was a scholar he studied pedantic book through this discussion we get this idea the ceramic richness is trying to give us it's not only the information is not about the idea or knowledge about Vedanta is not only reading the book and understanding intellectually stress should be given on realization and realization is possible when it is in a very in our own way not that everyone has to follow the path of knowledge which is really very tough so he was conversing we will read from here one cannot obtain the knowledge of Brahman see Ramakrishna is mentioning unless one is extremely cautious about the attraction of the world one cannot obtain the knowledge of Brahman he's not telling the grace of God the vision of God so we have to understand the Brahman and God is to two different things tomorrow I have been invited by a group of people somewhere in Chicago they have organized the Muslim and the Jews and Christians put this and from the Hindu they have invited me to speak on this topic who is God I have kept that flier with the air and I would notice board if you are interested you can come and join it will be interesting no doubt who is God now when we talk about God the Hindus talk about God the saguna brahman not near guna bomb unthinkable about the ninguna Brahma Saguna Brahma with appetites with the qualities that is equivalent to God otherwise it is impossible because it is only the consciousness only consciousness cannot create pure gold cannot make any ornaments jewelry's so obviously something must be mixed and when we are thinking about God see Ramakrishna that's why he is telling one cannot obtain the knowledge of Brahman unless one is extremely cautious about the attraction of the world therefore it is very difficult for those who live in the world to get such knowledge it's not impossible but difficult why if if you are trying to get the knowledge of Brahman then you have to practice renunciation complete renunciation otherwise it is impossible one may lead householders life after realizing God he is telling the conception of God is completely different from the Hindus perspective the God is more close we can talk to God you can see God we can touch God who can feed God the God is so close to us the same Brahman same consciousness he is as if coming down taking a different form and coming to the human being that's why the Hindus are having so many varieties of gods and goddesses otherwise would have been only one God so why we think in that way so many varieties the images that you see so being why because you can think of God in your own way you have the liberty but at the same time when you are going to reach to God you have to develop that discipline after that is it's not so easy that you will go and talk to God it's not that easy but then comparing with the knowledge of Brahman is very difficult why see Ramakrishna is tracing again and again because Maha michurin he was practicing that knowledge college-bound but that was not possible for him to that we get the realization see Ramakrishna the great master a wonderful teacher just like a loving father a loving caring mother he's guiding the disciples why you waste your time why don't you go and realize God the effort that you were giving it will be easy for you to reach God but the Brahman it will be very difficult and just in the previously he said now let me tell you something that will agree with your mood the Mahima journey is telling according to the Vedanta one has to know the real nature of one's own self according to the Vedanta Advaita Vedanta one has to know one's own self but such knowledge is impossible we doubt the renunciation of ego when you are reading the gospel is a teaching of ceramic is now is not the conversation is of course conversation recorded wonderfully by mindin our doctor but through this conversation he is giving an instruction instruction to people like mind on earth this instruction to there's money mature an instruction to the mahi mature people like me mature and by the way they are trying they will never get success it'll be wastage of time energy so that's why it's ramakrishna is concerned but the same see ramakrishna was insisting Noreen they're not who wanted to realize God would wanted to think that the God is there but see Ramakrishna almost forced him to think about the because he was capable to do that at the same time we those who have read the biography of ceramic richness the unique way he was teaching nor in dinars very close friend was recalled who became chummy brahmananda the schoolmates classmate so they used to go together to the Brahma semaj and the Brahmo Samaj in those days needs to say that God we doubt any image so they took the promise that we are not going to worship any image not in there was practicing that but Rahul Maharaj afterwards Swami Ramananda secretly used to go to Kali temple to the Krishna temple to offer pranaam once nor ever noticed any review you have given the word over there that you will never go to the temple when you're going and bowing down before the image there's all dolls you should not do like that and Rakas Mirage by nature very timid he was thinking what to answer and Serano krishna came in rescue and said why you were unnecessarily scolding him that is his nature so friends through this teaching we come to know according to our nature we should try to realize so those who are completely free from egos in ramakrishna stilling but such knowledge is impossible without the renunciation of ego not a single point of ego very mature and then nama krishna indirectly mentioning like that the ego is like a stick that seems to divide the water into it makes you feel that you are one and I am when the ego disappears in Samadhi the in one knows brahman to be one's own inner consciousness one must renounce the I that makes one feel then he is telling I am him are Chakravarthi indirectly he is mentioning that you always think that I am immature cruelty I am a knowledgeable person I know so much of scripture I know about Brahman even here sometimes some people they come and say oh we have already the ceramic is not show me be wakened we know all this thing what else and nothing else that is the that is complete if you know the Salam o Krishna that is complete so that is the ego reading means completed all that to cover to cover I have read the book but that is not the thing to understand and slowly you have to eradicate the ego a little hard somebody saves something immediately there's a American Swami was there in India and he was following show me to the ananda ji very very hard taskmaster to the ananda the studio energy used to teach him how to eradicate the ego you know how terribly scolding him rebuking him abusing him otherwise when you are going on sugar-coated words oh it is very good it's all right not like that you have to hurt him in such a way you will feel like leaving you and then only it is possible to eradicate the ego otherwise not people are constantly ego is just like the snake is all the time ready to bite no that should not be you if the ego is there then you turn that ego towards God I am the son of God and the daughter of God we are the children of God this is these it's okay but to understand the knowledge to Brahman nothing should be there just now afternoon was thinking nah he should you know yo tea that is called Samadhi Shami Vivekananda was trying to describe what is Samadhi and if you hear that song you read that the poem that Swami Vivekananda composed there is no son now he's Surya 9yo T no light now he sashanka even the moon nothing is there then it goes down slowly slowly explaining then finally he is mentioning the last tender two lines he is telling only I is floating why imatra army army high that I am meditating I am the bomb I am the pure that I is constantly floating and as if it is floating with the waves that also you have to remove when that is gone what remains one who has reached to that point can understand it otherwise it is impossible to describe ëcoz it is only you and nothing else cinema Krishna described that in a beautiful story a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean salt is built from the ocean water only and that doll went to measure the ocean and what happened nobody knows not even this doll because it over there so this cinema Krishna is asking one may lead householders life after realizing God it is like churning bottle from milk and then keeping the barter in water the beautifully he is mentioning after realizing God what does it mean it means all these things that we see over here so temporary God is only permanent so if I know that I will never be attached to all these things otherwise for every little thing people are so much attached sometimes when people are shifting from the one place to another they'll be taking each and everything even a small thing oh no that person gave me this thing and presentation huge and of course they they're having a very good business the remover backpacker and mover something like that they'll be coming packing moving no problem for them but I cannot give up anything each and everything I like to preserve small little thing why desire attachment to all these things and one cannot realize God by that way whatever that I see yes like this moment we should must be very careful about all this but when time comes I don't bother about giving it done mine should not go and address to it how it is possible again the ego I had to control the ego stay Ramakrishna is giving the example of Janaka the famous character in Ramayana the Janaka he was the father of Sita he was it Brahma eonni but at the same time was the king being a king he was the administrator he had to take care of everything but at the same time he was completely detached so that is called the householder after the Brahma of Gianna Mahima he is now to Mahima he is telling generally speaking there are two kinds of yoga yoga means the path of union with God process through which one can reach to God there are two type Karma Yoga mana yoga through the work one can go over there what did the work now each and every one is serving a doctor he's serving the patients of course he is charging taking money but at the same time very very careful each and every patient is separate very special this type of medicine may work on him but may not work on heart so all this day alert patient may be that they have forgotten to take the medicine doctor will incur have you taken the medicine that proper time what is the result is that that is called a perfect service just I have taken money you have taken my prescription go away die that is not a doctor and when a person is teacher he goes to this plastron gives the class and forgets about the students are the really improving never bother he cannot be called as a teacher so the same profession by attitude if your attitude is a service attitude then what you do there shortly Ramakrishna stilling Karma Yoga karma action same thing but at the same time just because he was so much concerned about that person and you were thinking god please help him even the prayer gently want us to pray sometimes sample people are coming they're going on talking we the Hmong should not be angry with them because that is our main thing we have left the heart and home to help people so obviously when the different type of people are coming sometimes some volunteers will comes and devotees will come why do you talk to them so much they have this type that type but for me they are all coming to God as best trait as possible I should serve and that is my karma karma yoga I cannot discriminate the ones moment I discriminate that is wrong sometimes people don't understand because different type of responsibility can be given to different people all cannot do same type of job they have the different categories so as an administrator I am giving them different thing will you please do this can you please do that that doesn't mean that I am differentiating or liking disliking not like that so this is what this telling karma yoga and Manu yoga constantly union with God one lady came very simple lady from Tamil Nadu but she can speak very you a good ending she came and she was telling from eg I love Sheba so much I cannot think of anything except Sheba when I am bathing putting the water on my own head I am thinking I'm doing the AVI shaker is the Shiva that I am bathing and when I am eating I am thinking first I'm giving the food to my Shiva anything that we I do wherever I go first I think about the Shiva constant that Shiva concept concept is within my mind you good or bad my god what do you think is very very good and you can see from her face very serene calm and quiet so that is the way one should develop so that is called mono yoga she is not really doing any work but she is concentrating whole mind her whole heart is on a particular idea Shiva the swishes then here it goes there are four stages in life Chauncy Ramakrishna's man four stages of life what a day Ramachari gorrister found a poster and sannyas we know that brahmacarya the preparation and goddess is a householders life vanaprastha retired life and then the vinyasa complete that renunciation cinema krishna is telling during the first three stage a man has to perform his worldly duties first three stages one must have to perform his worldly duties the sannyasi carries only his stuff her sannyasi there is nothing but what the clearest thing it is mandatory one must do when gentleman came and he was travelling over here I told are you married yes your family oh they're in India but are you having the contact with them or no I told them I am not having any contact with you and I am just here as a pilgrimage acceptor in India there are so many holy places you could do that and first and second days being a married person it is your responsibility to take care of your family at least you should have over a phone you can in cred what you are doing is they already know that is your duty don't behave like ours don't immediate us so that's Ramakrishna's teaching during the first three stages a man has to perform his worldly duties that is nothing wrong that is the duty but an artistry so this is the tricky thing everything that you are doing doing intently but uh not just to be the son as he carries only the stuff and he has nothing to bother as a sannyasi doe we are here in the society so obviously we are also maintaining some of the things that is necessary but when we are a wandering mom we never care anybody not a rich man or a government on these and their sannyas is just like a rhino moving all alone without carrying anything even the Lions the the Tigers rhino never bother that's why the scripture they say move like a Dino so that is the sannyasi attitude never God not that they are egoistic but not depending on anyone he will wonder even today previously of course it was there nowadays the civilized society so they are keeping an eye on the sannyasins giving them the medical previously with the sannyasis is to go to utter Kashi and rigged washy cash nothing was there a little small small villages very devoted people do poor people they used to bring some food that's all and when they could feel that develop some disease which will take long time to get out of it and then days to go and sit inside the water and it's to meditate on their I am going to die why to die giving trouble to others they will come and service this to go and sit nil Dada even that's still there the nil there are the sannyasins to go and sit inside the water and then waiting for the death to come never bothering others so that was the tremendous attitude if you have noticed that the elephants also they go away before death they go into a solitude never bothering others so that is the way in the case of a paramahamsa the cinema Krishna stealing all Karma's all poojas japa tapa sadhana and so forth drop away the Ramakrishna missions and lessons are Paramahamsa sannyasins we never carry the stop also if you notice the traditional sunnah she didn't carry the stuff that stuff means that will remind him about his responsibilities so that is the stuff that they are carrying but Paramahamsa sannyasi they don't do even that so that is ceramic is nice mentioning and it was about eight o'clock in the evening ceramic is not asked my immature and to recite a few hymns from the scriptures Maya was say he is not asking to recite the hymns to master Marshall he's asking my imagine now if the master ma che he was also a Sanskrit scholar in those days he was the master degree holder aiming from Calcutta University Union also but he is asking see Ramakrishna is asking before every on my imagined he wasn't very good in that so that is the thing a devotee should not think wisely Ramakrishna is only doing like this no not that one who is good in that should give the chance to him and this is the time cinema Krishna was giving the full attention to my imagine he was having wonderful knowledge but a little bit of ego I know the ceramic issue was held helping him to remove that to discussion and Mahima here stood aside from the scripture memory the first verse of the who targeted the true Gita is the instruction of on Sri Krishna to Arjuna about yoga and gana kutaragi dog we know that in the Mahabharata there is bhagavad-gita 700 strokers just before the world began mahabharata from Chaitra world the great holocaust that time sri krishna gave some instruction to arjuna that came down through the barcia as the bhagavad-gita 700 slokas war was over and they won that war Pandavas the stablished there the kingdom and all the thing was going on one day Arjuna came to Shri Krishna and dole will you please give me an idea about the ok Shiva tell me the knowledge of that brahmana which is one without a second Arjuna wanted to know about the Brahmin and which is one without a second please tell me about that and here we find he is going on telling about that to teach Arjuna said Krishna described the Brahmin and the first verse of the hotel gita he quoted and we find the first verse is just like this yeah deacon nish Kalam Brahma boom art eaten near on janam protection a beginning Bernard would put tip or Cheatham those who know little Sanskrit very simple he Brahmin is one yet he come yet means that that means the Brahmin because about the Brahmin only they say the first first verse sri krishna is telling giving the description definition of brahman is very difficult to give the disk definition so it is all impossible not difficult impossible but here we find say Krishna is giving an idea about Brahman what is that yet I come that one which is Brahman nish column he sparkless bow Martita near on janam stillness and beyond the ether boom ah boom amazed usually we say sky so bow Martita if you look at the sky usually whenever you think about the God you look up at the sky as if something over there but now it is much much beyond that nothing is there beyond that conception you cannot think of and it is part 'less it is not having any part o protection a big IAM without beginning or end or big game is unknowable by mind and intelligence Bernard Shaw petite Birgitta inertia the destruction the end would petite the creation is not created is not destroy it is eternal Bernard would put the Birgitta Vegeta means without without its birth or death without creation or destruction it is only the one then Arjuna his question is asking or Juna he knows Brahman who devoid of all desires meditate on oh and realizes hamsa hamsa means Paramatma if you have noticed the symbol of ramakrishna mission usually in the belong to societies we do not use that symbol but in india ramakrishna mission ramakrishna mod symbol is the one if you go and see it in our that Shiva and the hall the very big that symbol is there the center is a Swan the Swan is paramahamsa why this swans one is the Paramatma the symbol it is not the Swan it is a symbol of Paramatma because that is floating on water living on water but never touched by the water so Paramatma is like that then everything but never you contaminated by anything so that is the brahmana Mumma was going on reading the joke is whoever attained same sightedness beyond him behold him everywhere ceramic is not went into Samadhi I quoted that words I wrote eight wrote every year the third chapter seven sloka of the utter Elita it says you need agni table dejardine arm the GRT the jati means twice born the Brahmins Kshatriyas they take another birth by taking the young cuckoo be the first is one bird and second wind that first boy is seven or eight years old he is capable to understand that I am a human being I cannot behave like the animals I have to learn so that conception when it comes that is the age from seven to fourteen that is the age the Brahmans are the Kshatriyas we call it upper caste they take the young dope evita and it is considered the second birth so the Giardina dear God is Agni because they all the time worship in the fire Agni the board is RT nam moneena predatory bottom but the moon is the constant getting guarded in their heart not doing performing anything externally outside constantly meditating so that is called moneena ridi the bottom pratima sulfur wood Deena but those who are not that way intelligent 14 this pratima the images are necessary because they won't be able to concentrate their mind without the image now when they they come to religion we are you must come with a bathing and fasting and putting on the washed clothes and then you bring all this thing and sit like these do like that all this routine goes on for him and he thinks I am doing some religion and that is necessary for you slowly slowly they go beyond that if we can't go beyond that then you are not improving why the agony of me is not the fire is not having any image or still fire is an image still then something which we can utilize for our concentration but the Moonies at the best mañana Sheila they constantly go on remembering within their heart no God this is Hinduism it starts with the image it starts with the picture but it goes and ends with nothing so that it says AG need a bow dejardine arm Moony nam EDD bottom pratima salut booty nam sorry Bertram sama-darsinah but the some other she the monks the ascetics 14 everywhere that God no difference even the Moonies they are also trying to concentrate God within their heart but those who have realized the Brahman for them God is everywhere whatever they look at that is nothing but God if you read the back of your boss or the money day be the battery of Suruga Devi you will find that in every little thing she is considering that God each and everything when a crow it was flying it was a cough and also that cats each and everything the human being ordered a human being highly well placed educated human being no difference for her and Shami Vivekananda for him there was no difference the Vivekananda's disciple sustainability' wrote about the vacant under for him there is no secular or sacred the people always think about the secular and sacred oh that is the separate thing and this is the cooler this is worldly things Vivekananda it was no difference so this is the unique sarvatra sama-darsinah ha the master marsha he is telling that no sooner did the master heart the worse the jockeys who have attained same sightedness so this is one should understand a sannyasi hindu sannyasi in the monk cannot have any choice he's mine they are not naval the moment is say like that they lose their the sannyasa some others sick - ah that's where gymnastic cannot take up any social work so people sometimes they go and take up the job earning money at the same time wearing the Guru a cloth no one should not do that either you be a householder or be a sannyasi when you are a sannyasi or a monk you are so we are here having so much of responsibility but no attachment but if I take a job anywhere in the school or college or anywhere then what is going to happen to me I have to have some discrimination there are my students I have to take care of them carefully there are other school student we should not take care of them it we cannot do like that so this is the thing is telling same sightedness and that is the goal then he stood up and went into Samadhi ceramic isne the moment that idea came went into that great Samadhi and speech lace the devotees looked at this yogi who had himself attain the state of same sightedness after a long time the master regained the consciousness of the outer world and took his seat he asked Mahima to recite the verses describing the love of God the Mima is this coming from the Norwich er Neruda punter otra this is a very unique way the knowledgeable puncher atre the five standards nada the great devotee but at the same time he was an aura Brahmin he is mentioning here and in Sanskrit it says under bahi yeti hurry tapa shot attack him on turbo he JD hurry tapas ah dr. Kim non-turbo he now hunter Bui Yeti hurry tapas are attacking and here he says what need is there of penance if God is worshipped with love what is the use of penance if God is not worshiped with love under bah he inside and outside if you see God through love you need her to have any penance you have already risked to that stage if you are not having dad what is the use of doing that so in a very tricky way he is mentioning if you don't have the love for God then what is the use of penance practicing for the realization of God if you have already developed the love what is the use of practicing because you have already achieved the one gentleman he was supposed to go and give a talk a lecture he went and he asked there were two different sections do you know about the subject that I am going to speak yes sir oh then I need not to speak but the other half told but we do not know learn from them you say sir like this if you are having the love they need not to practice the penance if you are not having that love that also in again in the second line is telling our rowdy to UD hurry tapas are total Kim na are audited every tapas auditor Kim and here again he is telling what need is there a penance if God is seen weed and without our auditor Yeti hurry say what need is there a penance if God is seen everywhere what need is there for penance if you don't see God everywhere the Dare to another is going on giving so now after that master ceramic is no I was telling the last line there it says go to shankara shankara compost go to Shankara learn from him his ocean of heavenly knowledge wisdom obtain from him the love of God look at it he is ocean of heavenly knowledge then a team from him love of God so the devotion with knowledge without knowledge it is emotion not devotion the devotion is different emotion is different majority of the people the emotional and that's why in the name of religion defined and they think about others very in a different way even they become angry they become terrible go and kill others in the name of religion why emotion but the moment there is the devotion they will find God is everywhere in every being in different form how can they go in a heart others because God is having that form so this way as master Ramakrishna after hearing this his appreciating his heart like that women read from the UT Pancham Salameh Krishna's asking him to read another book yet even chicken and in the UT pan chicken it says in the Sanskrit the English book there is no Sanskrit I have mentioned the Sanskrit so it will be easy for you yes shemitah mchale peetam english aalam sure are embodiment of in assam such it Sukhram jaga DARPA Ruben Chaka Chaka amnesia Buddhist Ruben ninja Buddhist rupin I find in myself which is there everywhere it is in the God and transcription Nikhil Ananda ji is mentioning like this I am she the divine mother in whom the illusion of the universe of animate and inanimate things is seen I am the mother then again is telling she said the illusion of the universe this is pedantic point of view it's not creation is the illusion that Shankara is describing that way again the coming Sunday will be described we'll be discussing about the Shankara Vedanta illusion of the animate inanimate thing is seen as in magic and in whom the universe shines being the play of our mind I am she the embodiment of consciousness who is the self of the universe the only existence knowledge please Kashi calm need your Buddha Reuben within me need your Buddha solar-powered is the proper existence knowledge and please when the master heart the line I am she the embodiment of consciousness he said with a smile whatever is in the microcosm he's also in the macrocosm microcosm and macrocosm those who have read the biography of Swami Vivekananda you know that show me Vivekananda she was practicing he heard it he got some glimpses of course he went to Samadhi but still he wanted to get that knowledge within his own limit he wanted to enjoy that and he was travelling he was walking and with another brother disciple he was a young man the junior then Swami Vivekananda but they were rather disciples both were the disciples of ceramic ISNA one was Ockendon on the ji maharaj the picture that you see over there the second in the first picture of the second line there is a kundan and the G and the bare body is sitting he was a great traveler all the time is to travel at the age of sixteen seventy D joint it was a very strong bodies used to and he knew everything almost all look and corner of amalah so be weaken on the toll you beat my guide because you know of all these places that they went to a place called almora Kakori got still the place is there the  rig heart there's a name of the place and the district is almora the Sutra conned and there's a village on the top of the hill you have to go to the village for your food the Indians Aniyah since they go for begging the bacon on the tour to this young brother you better go with climbing the whole Hill it will be difficult I went over there is really difficult to climb over there and in that at the foothills there is a beautiful river reviewnit we can so not in tolbukhin the tool I will take about and then I will rest over here you better go the brother waned after beating Vivekananda came and sat under a people tree huge people tree maybe in the branch of that still surviving we also sat under that but nothing happened to us but nor endure not when meditated over there he got this idea microcosm macrocosm so micro the small
