ready let us begin with her stotra need engine and eaten an entire bum ba da no compa Drita become way yavitt arum para misha medium-term ramakrishna Sheila sana mama friends this is the last class and Pancham aveda of this year 2013 today's the 31st December and the weather is exactly the Chicago waiter as was forecast that there will snow heavy snow but I congratulate you that braving all this you have come and that shows your love for this teaching Serrano Krishna's to wait for the devotees after completion of his sadhana he was very eager to give that ideology the teaching the guidance to the devotees and used to go to the divine mother Kali and is to tell her sometimes complaining art mah HQ eloni today has no one has come so I was thinking that shall I have to go to until taught or the what is it well now that you have come am happy at least the last day of the year we should read a few passage from cinema Krishna discuss on that with all our experiences of the past year usually we stepped the new year and half of the world has already celebrated the first january and the western half is waiting at you celebrated tomorrow now when we are going to a new year what it brings to us our past experience and the future resolutions and you always planned that we are going to do something every society they all day also that the society also they'll be taking the stock they will also be thinking what they have done how far they have proceeded to their achievements how far they have good they could go too near to the goals what about the individual what is the goal bhagavan sri ramakrishna the god in human form in this modern age he has fixed the goal for the human being and what is that goal he has chucked out that and the goal is to eradicate the lower I and also to realize that real life these are this is a very simple thing we can easily remember to eradicate to remove the I consciousness what is that I and that is lower I gotcha army in the words of Bhagwan Shree Ram Krishna is a lower eye on ripen consciousness I and that I means when we say pointing to this body I pointing to this person I thinking that this is the lineage I that is unripe I but what is the real I God all-pervading consciousness and here we find in the all our suffering is due to this I raghavan Syrian Christians daily what is the problem in human life two things that will act to achieve something and we cannot when we cannot we suffer we like to get something when we cannot we suffer and here Sri Ramakrishna is pointing us that they're all our suffering is due to these I then he is giving an example the cow cries humba humba humba means I I which means I that is why it suffers so much it is yoked to the plow and make to work in rain and Sun they need may be killed by the butcher from its high shoes are made and also drums which are mercilessly beaten still it does not skip suffering at last strings are made out of his entrails for the boughs for the bows used in hurting cotton then it no longer says humba humba I I but to whom to whom Dow Dow only then Aras troubles over oh Lord I am the solvent thou art the master I am the child now are the mother so this is what he says because even after attainment of knowledge this I consciousness comes up he says begins that para with balance on business own world even after attainment of knowledge what is that knowledge that God is all-pervading that is the knowledge even after 10 meant that I consciousness comes and that is why what we should do so dear he says another story once Rama asked a new man how do you look on me and Hanuman replied o rama as long as I have the feeling of I i see that thou are the whole and i am the part thou are the master and I am the servant but when irama I have the knowledge of truth then I realize that thou art I and I am thou and wonderfully it says dejo budva da soham gb budva tadam Sokka art no budva tommy bahama ET main st timati nice cheetah this is my final decision misty timati final decision what is that the win I think that the my consciousness they who would draw the body consciousness then I am totally separated from you you are my master I am your servant now the I consciousness owned go I is going to remain how to how we can handle this thing that this is very difficult that is the problem and that is the root of the problem root of all suffering this I now this I only vers then how we can handle this this is uniquely very unique way see Rama Krishna is telling coating the bar beer an awana because he was very intelligent and he was a realized soul this mahaveer Jesus hanumana we very wrongly think that it is a monkey and they mostly they say an awana means monkey god no it's not that animal it is not the monkey that we see is aug great yogi is a human being but they used to take that type of form bailey is to dress like that that was the system in those days most of the small small group of people days to have because there's to live in the jungle these to adopt some of the animals or birds as their ideology we can say this to take that type of form and we can say that our nowadays the national animal national board as we are keeping as a symbol similarly these two also keyboard ever human being and the Mojave who was the disciple of Rama Sri Rama was a great yogi show me be wakened also says like that and he is telling when I feel that I am this body this consciousness is very strong then I am your servant and you are my master and we are totally separated dejo boudoir daso home gebo would draw a dumb Sokka but sometimes I feel that I am also consciousness and that consciousness not all pervading consciousness but at the same time in little up then the body consciousness I am little above then the body consciousness when that comes that is called G bothma the gb budva the UM shocker and the part of that great fire that is you Oh God and the part of God bad atma boudoir when I realized that I am all-pervading then tommy bahama you and me are one that is it e main st thomas e that is the three steps we can take this is a unique way is filling each and every one who are trying to realize the God we're trying to realize the art monogram one were trying to reach that God consciousness these are the three steps they must have to follow so here Serrano Krishna is telling eye and mind these constitute ignorance I and mine these constitute ignorance my house mind wealth my learning my profession the attitude that prompts want to say such things comes of ignorance on the contrary the attitude born of knowledge ease o God thou art the master and all these things belong to the house family children everything is nothing but yours and one gentleman who was telling us asking when I went to the downtown I was meeting some people he asked when the Jesus is telling that you have to love your oppressors to how it is possible and then I told it is possible if we change our attitude we have to think that everything is whatever is happening in our life it is God's will when somebody is coming and insulting me creating problem for me then I should go and fight with God I should be angry with God and I will complain to God I will say this person cannot do anything to me who is he we shake they cannot do anything to me it is you sitting over there planning to create problem in my life create all these hindrances in my life and you were sending those things through them I am NOT angry with these people but I am angry with you am I not your child to what you are giving me so much of suffering this way this is the this way also we are constantly thing in God so this is the positive way I am NOT angry with the people who are creating problem for me but that anger I am not free from that I am turning it towards God that is also the teaching of salam o Krishna he is telling turned your all cravings all our yearnings all wheels everything that you are having in your mind turn it towards God and by that way when you are complaining to God you are thinking God the moment you are thinking God you are getting your mind purified surely positively so I in mind this constitute ignorance then one should constantly remember he is giving another method we are I and mine when we say when we were at us to this and the attachment comes almost naturally we cannot say anything we cannot do anything that is the problem our birth we are attached to this now our goal is to realize our real self how by detaching this word from this world anything that we are thinking it is I and mine how we can do that then he is giving another system of practice and that is very unique one should constantly remember death nothing will survive depth we are born into this world to perform certain duties like the people who count from the countryside to calcutta on business salam edition is talking with the calcutta people so he's giving his example from the villages from the countryside the people they come to the downtown and they'll be working in different offices and then again after the work they go back to their own place similarly if a visitor goes to a rich man's garden he is giving their example we say this is mine this is my eye I have created I have made it is like superintendent when a visitor is visiting the rich man's garden the superintendent will say this is our garden we had made it but when the superintendence is dismissed if the master is angry for some reason and he dismisses the superintendent what will happen he cannot carry even ease mango wood chest mangrove root is the most cheap food very cheap because it is not a permanent thing and mango is so much in our country mango trees that's why it is very cheap also and even that thing he cannot carry out if this boss say the master say you had this means you have fire you go away God loves on two occasions he is telling when the doctors are giving assurance to patient who is dying issued to die and doctor says oh don't cry I am there then God smiles and when the two brothers they fight this portion is mine that portion of land is yours he says the whole universe his mind and these two fools are fighting for this small piece of land so this way he is telling can one know God through reasoning here he is talking with the big jajaja so obviously this topic is coming and here if this is the beauty of Bagger Vance I ramakrishna when he is talking with a group of people or a particular person he speaks what is good for that particular person but the Shocker is not a devotee he always reasons but his reasoning processes and not and that is the reason bhagavad see ramakrishna suddenly mentioning these can one know god through reasoning be his servant surrender yourself to him and then pray to Him then again he's telling God cannot be realized through mere scholarly reasoning reasoning is a process we know traditionally in Hinduism in sanatana dharma in vedic adharma we have the four paths that leads to the god gianna yoga karma yoga bhakti yoga raja yoga or Diana Yeoh Raja yoga that Swami Vivekananda coin that Raja yoga usually it is dianna yoga so through these four paths we can lead to God we can reach to God the reasoning why suddenly see Rama Krishna is telling can one know God through reasoning the next line he is telling God cannot be realized through mere scholarly reason in an ayah in the Bashar chica the six systems of Indian philosophy some of the mostly they'll be reasoning and some of the the things if you read you will be confused how their reasoning and it is just like they are forcing you to enter into a forest the Shastras the scriptures is like a forest and inside if you go you lose the path you lose the gold so difficult to come out and that's why I Ramakrishna is telling that type of reasoning on help you and he is singing afterwards a wonderful budgin he is telling ki Johnny Callie c'mon sharad or shinee nap I corrosion k Johnny cali c'mon who is there that can understand what mother Kali is even the six Russians are powerless to reveal Hall Prashad partial Uchiha shi Xiong coronation to Tauron here is telling even the people Prashad mani ram prasad he was agreed the devotee of golly he is telling when the ram prasad is thinking like this is talking like this that you cannot fathom the goddess Kali can you reason like that with all the six systems they are nowhere to explain the mystery of the goddess Kali and then the people are laughing at him all the scholars they can't so this way he is telling Prashad Abasi Lowe Kakashi but you can't understand shuangta Ronnie you are trying to cross the ocean by swimming you are trying to reasoning and to understand goddess Kali you know how it is as if one is trying to cross the ocean by swimming is it possible unfathomable is so vast ocean you think that you can cross so this way again that Prashad is telling rampu shoddy stealing a mar- GT prana bojhena dervish Hoshi way Baumann I have understood Mon widget a pranab aegina i have understood that i cannot understand completely what is my mother goddess golly but as a dwarf he wants to reach the moon to touch the moon even a normal person cannot think of touching the bone but a doer piece imagining that he will jump and touch the moon similarly my mind is also thinking that one day I will understand goddess Kali this is the beauty of the Kali Kristen they say Krypton means explaining about goddess Kali and the ramp Rashad is a unique way through the songs through the poetry's he is explaining this thing ceramic ich nur you has very fond of these songs here and there different time many times he has quoted the songs one must have faith in loved and what is if I am not understanding the goddess Kali by reasoning how can I realize God he is giving the answer one must have faith and love these are the two simple word but very profound words faith is a vishwas and how the faith will come we always say God is their God is their God will protect you but the person who is telling he also doesn't know what he's telling and the person who is hearing he is only being encouraged at that particular moment all but they also can understand that it has no meaning because we do not know what is God all around you live there is no God how can he have faith that the God will save me this is very peculiar only thing that you have to have love somewhere what is that love love in the personality of a great person bhagavan sri rama krishna bhagwan buddha Lord Jesus like that personalities who are really unselfish and they really come forward to help you weed out any person non-interest and they want to help you so they say believe in God and as because I love him I believe in his words because he said that his God and I have every faith if you go and pray to God with your tears he will surely listen to you and grant your prayer these are the words of the sea Ramakrishna and the great masters so if we have that love for God love for the person and that is called Avatara the great personalities are the Guru and then we develop a faith on god and from the faith one or two realizations comes I start believin feelin realizing then the larval to come for God so when I am going to wait I am taking the name of Lord and asking him be with me when I'm sleeping don't leave me when I am getting up again I am Telling we always with me when I'm working because I am the child I have every right on my mother I don't care whether the mother is busy with many other things I want your company be with me and this is not ordinary mother the Divine Mother and already she is there within my mind within myself so only thing that has to come by hard grace by the grace of God feeling I start feeling that it is already there within my heart when I just suck you to stop i feel i am taking the name of God when I am sleeping deep sleep I come up suddenly I realized that I am taking the name of God that is the faith and love so these are the two things that we have to practice first Bashar's fade and then love then salam o Krishna tells a wonderful story some of the people so called intellectual people may not like it but he says let me tell you how powerful faith is a man who was about to cross the sea from saloon to India just story some people should not go and tell this is not a history in her this is the story how the faith comes Barry Shoshanna the brother of Rama who sided ramachandra and he deserted his brother and some people they will be telling the Guru shot Rubi vision the someone who actually deserted but he deserved it for the God so that is what Bhishma a great personality but even then God arcs or you know to kill him to shoot her against him at him why because he made a mistake though he was the son of Ganga even then though he was protected though he himself was a great personality oshte washu even then shri krishna the god is telling arjuna should taro against him why because he wanted to keep his promise and to give his promise to show that he never deviates from his words he was siding the irreligious people he was siding bad people like do you donnas so that is why we should learn that we are always with God for that if we have to go against our own key thanking our parents our brothers our family I don't mind i am with God so that is the real reasoning I am always with good I can never view it bad when the dojo Donna went to his mother was also having a psychic power whatever she said that coming to truth because she was serving her husband through faithfully and bye dad she practiced so much of so much of penances and earned that mystic power Georgia Donna knew it and he thought I am his son and if i go to my mother Shirley mother will bless me and the moment the mother says be je haha and go and conquer and I will surely be successful when he came and prayed to his mother but the mother said she wept bitterly afterwards but when the Georgia Donna came for hard blessings see neighbor saved and that go and you'd be successful now she said if you are on the side of the truthfulness of the religion then you are going to be successful o my son yet or Dharma the two Jaya where there is the righteousness where there is God that side will be successful if you are in that side you will such visits so Thea also we find the same thing the parishioner he deserted the camp of his brother and he before that he wind up to the level to tell him to make him convince Rama is not your ordinary person he is the God Himself we cannot fight against him but this was supposed to be so he kicked him then only he left the camp and came to of the Ravana and aim to the Rama and this division has said to him the person who was supposed to cross the ocean how to cross the ocean he said to him tie this thing in a corner of your wearing cloth and you will cross the sea safely by walking walking on the water and you will be able to walk on the water but be sure not to examine it or you will sink because the division are knew that he is not having the field the provision aha is having the complete faith so he told the man was walking easily on the water of the sea such is the strength of the faith when having gone part of the way he taught what is this wonderful thing division has given to me that I can walk even on the water he became curious he untied the knot and found only a leaf with the name Rama on it oh just this he thought and instantly he sank the faith and without faith if you are having the faith you can do this type of work also that is the teaching of the story have faith in God and you can go the person who is not having the legs even can climb if the God is giving the blessings to that person so that is the faith it says there is a popular saying that only one had jumped over the seal through his faith in Rama but Rama himself had to build a bridge they jokingly they say Rama had to cross over the bridge but when 101 I simply jumped in the name Rama this is the faith and then see Rama Krishna in ecstasy singing if only I possibly repeating do God's name how can't now then Oh Blissett one withhold from me deliverance Richard oh I maybe Amador god durga durga bully Majid amore Akira adini Notaro kimoni daca javi goes on curry Adina means i am not that religious person right us person and I am not in very austere pure self but at the time of my death I have taken three times durga durga durga the name of that you mother how come that you should not come to me you must have to come and where there is Durga nothing bad can happen so that way she is he is telling I have complete faith and through that way he will be going on doing anything which sometimes notice that some of the naughty child they'll go and have a fight with another child and immediately when they have come to beat him he will come running and take the shelter at the back of the mother mother will somehow pacify the other he is free from the beating from the prince but again he will go and do that he is a naughty one but he knows very clearly my mother is going to save me if the mother is around nearby all this he will do but the moment there is no mother you won't do he knows that there is no one to save me this time so that is why if we have the complete faith in God we can do anything the master continued he's telling faith and devotion he said faith and love and here is the link faith and devotion one realized God easily through devotion we can realize God through devotion and again he is telling how are you trying on my mind to know the nature of God you are groping like a madman locked in a dark room through the song you can express the philosophy in a very easy simple manner here the ceramic ISNA is telling through the that viciosa maan ki koro tot totally genuine Amato had her career shakib Xavier wish I ship a very be shy Bob betito of Habakkuk tafari his telling this is you have to have that you realize God you cannot some people will be telling prove that that God is there how can you prove this is the feeling I one person asked me how can you prove that the God is there then I told do you believe that your mother loves you it's a sure that I prove it how can you prove that your mother has gifted you too panch and char or some sweets or these and that is this the expression of love how do I feel it and that is the reason you know that your mother loves you and no one even if they are not believing if they are criticizing they are telling something against that I do not believe you know sure because this is the realization there are many things which you cannot express you cannot take to the laboratory and give an example that this is this if you are mixing these and these now love comes now it is not possible to that feeling that here again that Ram Prasad is telling that you are searching God it is like a man searching the door mad actually val is not having the balance and then it is a dark room and now he is searching for a thing inside the dark room how it will be similarly when we are reasoning and trying to find out God it will be like that mone Koro kita kita toka rotary genuine vato who not to means the man other gori in a dark room he's searching then then the last line of the song he is telling again the prasada Prashad means Ramprasad Ramprasad volley matra Bobby Amitabh takua jere whom i call as the mother chatta chatta rakib hongbo re am I going to explain it in the market who will understand it is it possible to tell the philosophy to the ordinary people how people will understand it you need some background some training then only will understand realize the god what I am Telling see ramakrishnan is telling that Ram Prasad as he is telling he says rampu shot I approaches mother that I approaches mother but must a give away the secret here in the marketplace the mother and the Brahmin are one in the next salam o Krishna is telling Brahman and Shakti are identical like fire and its power many people will be telling about the goddess Kali and in those days because of the British rule the missionaries they without understanding the real philosophy it's all symbolic and they were going against this and they were criticizing and many of the so-called educated people they went the goddess Kali only Saddam o Krishna he took of it and he is now telling quoting Ram Prasad the goddess Kali is nothing but the brahmana the Brahman and shakti brahman alone is addressed as mother this is the one of man cannot really help the world man alone does second next day now it is already 8 30 so next again next day in the new year with a fresh mind with a great new vigor will try to realize God and we must pray to the mother because that conception of mother is so easy when the moment that people say it is Brahman all-pervading God all-powerful is so difficult to understand and when this is the father the ruling father died just father he is there to give the judgment we are afraid the moment you say mother we can immediately understand even we are repeating making mistakes there is someone will forgive me I can always go and say I'm sorry and I will surely know she is going to hurt me and take me on a lap so this is the mother conception excellent Concepcion ceramic ich nur is introducing once again to this modern world and in the next time again we will read about it it is completed today by offering our pranaam to govern salama tishnar need Anjana medium unintel bomb pop da new compa Drita Bikram boy ye chaahat autumn / Amish a medium Tom Lama krishnam Sheila sana mama Oh John Dee shanti shanti hurry
