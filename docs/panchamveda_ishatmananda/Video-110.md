[111: Panchama Veda 111: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZuwI3hsst8)

good evening let us join that mantra and then we will start this gospel of serum a piscina de Vaca Tom rhythm dr. G be topped achieve annum Kobe very little calm Asha bahama surana mangalam srimad artem booby Goonan de bourr√©e dodgin aha in our last discussion on the 7th we have already discussed about the Incarnation cinema Krishna is mentioning about the Incarnation this is very important and there we have seen how in different religion they have dealt with this conception this idea incarnation this incarnation is the power of God the Incarnation it is coming the God Himself is coming in the form of a human being or many other beings so that is called incarnation the God the Creator through his inscrutable power which is known as maya in hindu scripture takes forms that is called incarnation that is the belief of the Hindus God Himself is coming taking the human form and we will come to that afterwards but here we find the another word that is Maya it's also very interesting this Maya according to the Shankaracharya the great exponent of the vedanta the ultimate reality brahman or the supreme self who is pure consciousness the nature of non-dual became the cause of the universe of multiplicity so unless we understand the small these things we all be able to understand what is a Hinduism the Hinduism is a vast philosophy and the religion the process the practices the rituals that you see is only to reach to that excellent knowledge wonderful knowledge and knowledge is the ultimate reality they call it and they call it the same as Brahman do we are very much aware and familiar with this particular word Brahman this ultimate reality Brahman at the supreme self who is pure consciousness and this pure consciousness how it can be became so many varieties multiple multiple existences here it says the pure consciousness perceived itself with I consciousness the step-by-step we see the pure consciousness which is all-pervading and everywhere this pure consciousness suddenly thinking as I consciousness this I consciousness means you so from that I consciousness coming all home i arose in the basis of difference I became the basis of so many differences the primal modifications manifestations of the creative energy of the pure consciousness the last class we were discussing about the avatar in the Avatara also the God as Eve taking the form of human being as if taking the form of human being means what he is not even being he is not like hers he's as if taking the form like in the dramas in the movies we find a person suddenly a very young man acting as an old man as if he's not in reality but as if he is an old man so similarly that pure consciousness all-pervading consciousness becoming I conscious and the duality begins one became too and that too became in the conception of the human mind husband and wife the two became mother and the father and that also became in the conception of the Hindus Sheba and Kali the pure consciousness pure consciousness and its creative energy the pure consciousness and its creative energy now we have the consciousness when that consciousness goes away we die though all the body and everything is there where the consciousness goes is goes and merges with the pure consciousness because these are all reflected consciousness so this is the conception of hindus the scripture described that Brahman the pure consciousness the absolute reality all these and the same thing was so difficult to explain so we are going on giving different names the Brahman the pure consciousness was experiencing the breeze then they're suddenly arose as Eve a certain state like deep sleep when you go to deep sleep we are not conscious about it as if this consciousness went into that deep sleep they are trying to explain it's so difficult to explain how from one so many millions came from one not from two from one so obviously from one so many came how it is possible so they are trying to the rishis they're trying to explain in this way that as if it went into a deep slumber enjoying the breeze that Ananda then within the mind it came from that state of the supreme self Maya the elusive power of the Supreme cell was born from that condition the Maya was born this is the Maya the word Maya and the nature prakruthi pollution property that is the philosophy of the somme cares they had the prakruti and the pedantic Maya are different but in the shatter shatter upanishad it says maya means per kathy said he had the Maya the concept conception of the Maya is the central pillar of the vedantic tart because Vedanta says this world is illusory we will come to that and we will read from the passage of swami vivekananda how he is explaining so sri ramakrishna he will be talking about the Maya and before that we are trying to get an idea about this Maya and ceramic ISNA the you know that I was just observing and just going through the back pages and I found on 29 September 2015 we discussed at length on this Maya so I am NOT repeating those things and it is in the YouTube anyone can go and visit all the descriptions were given including the scientific the scientist words also like the professor Capra and all now in the 270 page of the gospel of ceramic is not here we find Saddam o Krishna is describing it says once read a brought a bull cough here here means induction Asia and Griffey he was he's a relative the young man he came to assist see Ramakrishna in the Dutch nature varutha ramjet about that this really brought a bull cough I saw one day that he had tied it with the robe in the garden so that it might graze there I asked him ridoy they his name is Reed aram SE ramakrishna used to call him as a read a read a why do you tie the cob there every day uncle he said i am going to sing this cup to our village from Calcutta from the kitchen assure readers village is very far away and in those days there is no other vehicle only to walking we need grow strong I shall yo get to the plow as soon as I heard these words I was stunned to think how inscrutable is the play of the divine Maya gamma cuckoo and she she who is the main place of this our diorama still that house is there with the his house the shield from kamar poker is not very far and so far away from Calcutta this poor calf must go all that way then it will grow and at length it will be worked into the plow this is indeed the world this is indeed Maya ceramic ISNA is telling and after thinking this I fell down unconscious Weiss Ramakrishna became unconscious because he was thinking look at this whole world nothing is going to be permanent but people take it so seriously and they are planning everything in such a way that as if they are going to be here all through permanently so when we understand these then if we look back in our lives so many phases we have already crossed we have already passed and we know that in every phase so many different things happen at every time we thought this is the permanent thing if I don't get this i am going to lose it I am so feel sorry and all that then time comes all changes everything changes we see it observe it experience it every day every moment but still we think we are going to be permanent so that unquestioned that dharmaraja was asking yudhistira in the Mahabharata what is osteria whom you called wonder then the yudhistira said oh honey oh honey boo tani got gentium on Durham steerer hermiston t.t master Yamata param every moment people are dying in this world all around but those who are surviving the oddest thing i am going to survive hey everyone we go so if we remember that we can understand everything is going to be changed those who first came over here in the construction of this building sometimes they say all this was jungle like this there was nothing big trees so many trees we had to for all you have to cart history's clean this land now it is a different shape god bless it but maybe one day again this same place will change it will be different type different shape people will change everything will change it goes on but when we think it's so seriously then it is called Maya we're from it came the unscrew tible power of God and it comes from God itself so this is called the Maya YC Ramakrishna felt like that Shami be back on the side this world has no existence and this is the difference between the eastern thought and wisdom toward the Western philosophers the Western thought mainly even in the culture also if you see in the Greek culture they're always showing exactly photogenic descriptions when they are painting they are painting something exactly as it is but the Eastern culture imaginative if you see there the eyes are coming out bigger than the mouth it looks peculiar but that is the art that is the culture why because we can see beyond this body far beyond we can see many things that is the idea and when they are drawing in the words of Vivekananda he goes on telling like this and this is called Maya when it says this world has no existence what is meant by that Shami Vivekananda is asking again explaining it means that it has no absolute existence so we have to remember these word absolute existence now it was not having any permanent existence it exists only in relation to my mind and to the mind of everyone else when we are thinking it is existing when we cannot then it is not existing we see this world with five senses but if we had another sense we you see a sea in it something more if we had yet another sense it would appear as something still different it is therefore no real existence it has no unchangeable a movable infinite existence nor can it be called non-existence again this is the the Maya it has no existence permanent existence but at the same time we cannot call it as non-existence seeing that it exists we are touching we are smelling we are feeling we are testing we are seeing all these five senses they are experiencing nothing is it possible no it is there but temporary there so what is Maya it is covering its real nature what is that real nature that it is temporary and after covering that it is again giving an different idea what is that albarran and big shaper what is that big shape giving a totally different idea what is that it is permanent it's covering that it is impermanent and at the same time it is giving an idea that it is permanent that is the wrong thing we find that Maya is not a theory for the explanation of the world Shami jeez mentioning it it is simply a statement of fact as they exist that the very basis of our being is contradiction that everywhere we have to move through these tremendous contradiction wherever there is good there must also be evil and wherever there is evil there must be some good wherever there is life did must follow as its shadow and everyone who smiles will have to weep and vice versa so this is the contradiction all through our life we find that is why Sri Ramakrishna he fell unconscious when he saw that read I staying with him for such a long time 19 years his I ROM give the service to see Ramakrishna but learned any nothing so that is the thing when we go and have that company of the holy people we must also learn from them what is that that this world is temporary life is temporary there is something must be permanent we must try for that now can the state of things be redeemed we may verily imagine that there will be a place where there will be only good and no evil where we shall only smile and never weep this is impossible in the very nature of things for the conditions will remain the same wherever there is the power of producing a smiling us their Luck's the power of producing tears wherever there is the power of producing happiness there remains somewhere the power of making us miserable that this is what Xiaomi vivekananda he is mentioning this Maya is not real since it disappear on the dawn of knowledge of the brahmana bhagawan sri ramakrishna also may say this that in olden days there was not much of entertainment some people they had the capacity to dress in such a way changing their own personality in a different way dish to come to the villages and there is to act like that they've changed their voice why is etc people stranger that was the entertainment this this to call themselves baju rupee but who means many rupee means form different forms they themselves wish to put on and go to the villages entertain the people now when they're coming in the form of a king or maybe a dick hard maybe or something else the simple minded people sometimes is to take it seriously and this to be some days is to fill in that way but someone suddenly oh no this is there was a person named Sri dama you see this is freda Hama Berube the name of the person is freedom immediately whatever the dress and the Cauvery tube it breaks original person comes the similarly this Maya also when we are going on concentrating meditating on the image of God praying slowly slowly our mind becomes totally free from all this illusion then only one thing remains and that is consciousness that is the joy that is the eternity and all other things they go away and mind becomes totally full of joy and no pain at all why I am eternal I'm not going to change anything anywhere and we find over here that Maya is not real since it disappears on the dawn of knowledge Maya is equated with nature or the visible universe consisting of the three modes of energy one is Satwa of the harmony another Rajas our activity and the hummers the inertia Maya is the inscrutable cause which depends on the supreme self which is the ultimate reality now there is an objection they say you say the Maya is an illusion you say the Maya is not existing then objection is coming as for Maya it is invisible you cannot see it you cannot touch it then it is invisible not experienced by the senses how can it produce a thing that is visible that means we can experience through our senses you say that God created this universe through the power of Maya if it is so the Maya which you cannot feel with the senses you cannot see you cannot touch you can smell you cannot taste in that case how that can produce a permanent thing I mean existing thing which I can see I can touch then it says the reply it says that a person in a sleep he saw that the tiger is chasing him when he was sleeping he was lying on the bed comfortably within his room only he was dreaming when he was dreaming he saw a tiger chasing the him and that became so real for him in the dream itself that is sweated then when he woke up he saw that his whole that garment with which you are sleeping or the mark of that sweet is there it's firm it is dear I can see but we're from it came from the tiger because of the fear of the tiger where is the tiger it is in dream where is the dream it does not exist so similarly the bed on teen they proved in this way it is not existing Maya but at the same time it has the power to create in such a way that you feel that it is true as the person you are seeing the tiger chasing was true to him in that particular moment so when we get up we find that everything all over is nothing but the consciousness and here in the shutter upanishad the fourth chapter taint mantra it says my arm to recruit embittered minder maheshwaram maya and my in two words it is used here in the Upanishad ma√≠am to Parker team prakriti means the nature with the art you must know and mine the master of the prakruti maheshwaram is the supreme god maha ishwara maheshwara the supreme god that means the brahman out of which everything has come now these two words they are using that is called the Maya and that means the prakruti and also the master utilizing that power that power and the master are same raghavan see Ramakrishna in his own excellent way he is giving the example the fire and the burning capacity of the fire are inseparable you cannot separate the burning capacity of the fire from a fire yet ogni dahi car Shakti when you offer pranaam to marsha the money devi we say like this ya ha Agni daha car Shakti when in that fire the burning capacity is there similarly in cinema Krishna Marcia Radha remains how as the god and he's inscrutable inscrutable power this Mahamaya this is the another concept and now that God the Supreme God who was all alone one pure consciousness as Eve thought I want to be meaning so the Hindus believe from that thought only everything has been created and when the creation came it became the responsibility for the God also to maintain that and to maintain properly guiding them to come to the truth there are two things one is the truth which is hidden behind the untruth who has created the untruth god now what he wants we should realize by breaking this untruth removing the untruth and we should go towards in which is the truth the permanent peace happiness everything and when he sees that many of us we cannot do that rather we take it in a different way we accept which is wrong then it becomes difficult for him to remain in that form so he comes and taking the human form he becomes the Avatara then sometimes in our villages the scientist they come and they like to teach the villager simple-minded villagers that if you are drinking it is so bad because it will kill you how you know then they will keep that the wine in one glass and they will put some warm in that and immediately it dies worms dying then they will ask the villagers hey what you have learned from this experiment then one he raised his hand and stood up and said said he everyone should drink wine Oh what is it we have come forward which is no no no this teaches that whatever germ is there inside us if we drink wine it is dead so we will remain good so everyone now this is the problem with the God the God wanted to teach us that all that you see with beautiful attractive but temporary if you are giving the mind in these then you will suffer so you better turn your mind and come to me so that is his teaching we are understanding in a different way we are accepting these as permanent and doing so many things all the movies all the the dramas based on these only and people they are trying to grab the property and the wealth and these and the countries fighting with the country's why to grab these what this land and what is going to happen it is so temporary but still we cannot understand we are ready to kill thousands millions and spending millions of dollars to develop destructive things by that we can destroy the whole nation why we should capture this land after capturing the land what happens everything goes away so that is the Maya inscrutable power of Maya so the God comes attitude in order to bring people spiritual knowledge this one is body grows another spirit so spiritual knowledge out of this body it goes to the spirit this is called the spiritual knowledge so that exactly what happened in that in the case and then we find that three mree more he is mentioning the one wonderful discussion with him sri ramakrishna deed master and more that is the chapter here it says it was August nineteen eighteen eighty-three master mache giving a description it was Sunday the first day after the full moon see Ramakrishna was resting after his room it known male why he is mentioning this because afterwards the people can see that can check the Almanac it says the August nineteen eighteen eighty-three whether it was the next day of the full moon they can understand that and immediately they will know that this was true it was the known and so after the mill midday meal see Ramakrishna was taking little rest and he had the habit of taking little rest and immediately is to come up and talk with the people because for that is the reason the God has taken the human form so he was never tired of giving the instructions of the people particularly those who were open-minded and was eager to learn about the spiritual knowledge Sosa Ramakrishna he saw em master Marsha who was noting all the conversation he was sitting over there see Ramakrishna say to him self-knowledge is discussed in the austere bockris ami de hasta Baptists Amita Sri Ramakrishna we all know those who have read the biography he never attended the schools but you see austere bokra samhita is the pedantic book it speaks about hi dhaanto philosophy very few people they go through the pages of the Osterberg crucem gita but cinema Krishna knew why he knew that the historical scimitar speaks about the self knowledge that is Brahman the non duelist say soham in master Masha he was an educated person and in those days the most of the people this to follow mainly this balanta why because then they could avoid the image warships because the British errs discredit this type of the idea that how the God can entered into the images the Hindus were confused and eating the leaders of the Hindus they were not ready to give the answer and that was a confusing period so most of the educated Hindu they started thinking that Hinduism weed out the images some him also used to subscribe to that idea so serrano Krishna was asking him that what is your idea the I like this without God God without form this good once he said now we have seen that previous day ceramic is not old may I tell you one thing don't disbelieve the forms of God don't disbelieve the forms of God he said to him today again he has picked up conversation with aim and the first thing he is telling that self knowledge is discussed in the ostrava crow samhita non dwellest that means those who say God is only one and without any second no duality non well you say so um I and that they say there is only one there cannot be two the new am i if God is separate and then I am separate then that means it is to do a lity soham they say so hum i am that there is only one i am the supreme self this is the view of the sannyasi ins of the vedantic school ceramic is never so thorugh there's no mistake in it but this is not the right attitude for the householders see mom he was a household at a married person having the children the responsibility to look after the family and he was thinking the god did or form and I am that etc etc salam o Krishna was see that is the reason the incarnation incarnation of God to guide the disciples to guide the spirits in a proper way what do you want just to go and telling in the world that I believe in Vedanta bed antha is the highest philosophy or you really want to know God you really want to develop yourself in spirituality in that you must concentrate on those ideas which will help you Sosa ramakrishna stilling this is for the sannyasins they don't have any responsibility in this word they can say I am that and they can remain in that but how about you the household that you have your children you have to work somewhere you have to earn money you have to feed them here to maintain your family you should not say there that's why he is telling but this is not the right attitude for householders who are conscious of doing everything themselves that being so how can they declare I am that the action less supreme self you cannot say like that according to the non dwellest the self is attached the good and bad virtue and rise and the other pairs of opposite cannot in any way injured the self though they undoubtably afflict those who have identified themselves with their bodies we have seen very recently ramen marshy the salmon Marcy he was not affected by anything with the hundreds of ants biting his body he was observing quietly show me are you not feeling pain I am not feeling pain because they are biting the body why should I feel the pain that is the idea when you say the non duelist I don't belong to this body I am the Othman i am the consciousness I don't feel anything in this I am NOT elated I am NOT dejected I am NOT happy I am not sad so that totally going beyond is not so easy for and particularly not easy for all people so it says in that way smoked soils the wall ceramic is not giving an example smoke soil the wall certainly but it cannot in any way affect arkasha the space following the Baron things of this class krishna kishore used to say now he is giving an example Krishnaji sure there is a name of a person who wish to come to the Ramakrishna and he used to brag the time of a daunting and non dwellest and I am caw caw means the akasha call me is the space that means I do not have any form the krishna kishore used to say like that I am calm that in Bengali and the Sanskrit also they've nagar e this second later caw-caw this call means aakarsha meaning Akasha being a great devotee he could say that with some justification but it is not be coming for others to do so all cannot say like that even in the petitioner t-shirt afterwards here in the gospel who you read that in one place or maybe in the biography the krishna keisha took some money from some people and then afterwards he was not able to pay it they went to the coat coat gave that verdict you can sell his own property and give the money back to those people so naturally the government people came and they were assessing and they were on that process selling out all the properties of the Krishna kishore then krishna she was crying they are taking out everything my house my utensils my DS my dad and that time see Rama Krishna told but why you are crying they are taking the house that is that don't belong to you you are the call your doc Asha you are unaffected he said no no no that I used to say but now I am everything so that is why when we feel like that we have no reason to say that we are the followers of the non dwellest so it goes in this way but to feel that one is a free soul is very good see Rama Krishna is giving this by constantly repeating I am free I am free a man verily becomes free this is a wonderful teaching I am free I am NOT bound by anything how can I be because when I see that nothing can bind me whatever I was having I am giving it away I have already given given it I don't have anything why should I feel pain when I am leaving body so by that I am free I am free I am free that is a mantra sadhana Krishna is teaching and then a person becomes totally free and those whose repeat ceramic richness aid I am bound I am bound this certainly becomes bound to worldliness the fool who says only I am a sinner am a sinner verily drowns himself in the worldliness the most of the in there's a bush nabob banaya they say banaya means the humbleness the bush nerve is supposed to become humble why by seeing God in everything they should be humble but they think in a different way they they are not humble in reality but they like to show it and that is why the word coin boyish never be 9 everyone is constantly no no you are fast you're fast and then the jokes came when the electric train came in the india and naturally previously people is to travel in a very slow-moving trains now this electric game is faster than that the jokes came the moment you miss immediately it reaches the next station you are missing so two persons they came separately they wanted to enter into that train but when they saw each other they say Oh sir you are fast up i late you are fast you must enter after you is it no no no no you are my senior you must first so when they were going up by Lee up early you go first then the Train moved away and there is nothing so like that unnecessary when the practical things we miss we are not understanding the practical thing then we are not understanding the religion and ceramic is nuttiness aid I have chanted the name of God how can I be a scene that is the courage religion gives courage I have taken the name of God I have chanted the name of God who is pure with pure consciousness with the creator of this universe how can I be so weak I am NOT weak so that is the strength how can I be bound that is the strength constantly if we go on taking the name of God and again he is telling to the aim you see I am very much depressed today now after giving this high teaching he is little coming down because he's an avocado Avatara behaving just like ordinary man just like an ordinary person so immediately after that you find that cinema Krishna how he is he could simplest without mentioning it you could stay but no no hypocrisy he is giving it as it is he had that wonderful knowledge constantly not that knowledge was there he was aware that he was God Himself not bound by anything not affected by anything but here he has taken the human form so he's showing that limitations of the human body and he was telling to aim his disciple again you see I am very depressed he is supposed to be beyond the happiness and this sir depressed why r ed has written me that he is very ill why should I feel dejected about it is it because of Maya or Doya he is asking to him now the master he was giving the teaching to the disciple and to take the test how far he has understood him he is taking this day see today I am not very happy why because my nephew he has written to me that he is not well so I am depressed immediately he was asking is this Maya adaiah because he explained to him before and here also here that you will explain if you are feeling attracted to your own people only to your own people it is Maya which binds but if you feel that same feeling for each and anymore everybody that is daya and that is the divine power he is telling do you know what Maya is is explaining again it is attachment to relatives parents brother sister wife children nephew knees all this attachment and diamines love for all created beam now what is this my feeling about today is this Maya or Doya he is asking again explaining the thing to him but see they did so much for me now he is explaining about read a giving the clues to the more master marsha before answer me they did so much for me he they served 19 years continuously he served me wholeheartedly notched me when I was ill but later he tormented me also the torment became so unbearable that once i was about to commit suicide by jumping into the Ganges from the top of the embankment those who have read the biography don't know so who they used to insult him so much so much and so much you are serving he served when afterwards he became egoistic thinking that all big people is to come to meet sidamo Krishna so before going to see Ramakrishna dish to go to his assistant surely all the time available at the door and he is to take that pride no you cannot meet the master now or wait come some other day he is to take that pride and when Saddam o Krishna is to take his own decision he he is to say you cannot do that i must say that then only you can do see what happened that way when he was serving the god himself in the form of ceramic krishna if he only could understand that he could get liberation we do not know of course because this is all the play that they were playing his part was that he was playing but apparently we can say he was away from the God because of the ego that developed within him that I am serving game and that is why he is surviving it happened in this way that one brahmacari was coming down after completing his meditation and Torian energy he used to serve to Rhiannon the G personally we're giving serving the food washing the clothings and all that cleaning his room that was the service used to give to the tree another tree analogy saw him coming down and suddenly he got up and started rebuking him very strong language and the premature he was taken aback and resting white swami ji so angry with me other Swami's who were sitting with Torian energy they were also not understanding what happened to him the schwa me 3 analogy he was otherwise so gentle courteous now the brahmacari went 300 white he sat then the other brother monks they asked what happened to you why you were scolding that Brahma cherry he didn't do anything wrong after his meditation in the morning he was coming down the Brahma cherry I didn't say anything to him 300g was dealing I was driving away a bad soul which tried to enter into him it was at his back of the brahmacari he tried to enter into him I noticed it and I drove him away so that he should not disturb the brahmacari and what service he is giving to me a little physical service I am serving him by saving his spirit so that is exactly what see Ramakrishna he was serving by giving these instructions ideas constantly every moment showing his own lives example but people they were so close physically they were serving see Ramakrishna but still unfortunately particularly in the case of the diorama could not understand that at two or three o'clock afternoon other Shane and Balarama arrived there mention three Moyes mentioning and see Ramakrishna mentioned about Rida rom and also lamented now my mind will be at rest if he gets some money because a poor man is a Brahmin he was not having money so we're how he will support his family and also for his own treatment so salam o Krishna was thinking to support him with some money but we're from Seattle Krishna will get of course if he said that to matter Babu or the rich disciples immediately the problem would have been solved but he never mentioned and he said now my mind will be at rest if he gets some money but whom shall I ask for it he was mentioning it to a master Martha was a humble teacher and in those days teachers used to get very humble salaries but he never mentioned it to other shame other Shin was deputy magistrate his to earn a lot of money then the balarama Bors he was the landlord he didn't mention this to burger because the moment they will hear will be so happy to send some money to regard salam Krishna just mentioned that because he never begged for this way then ceramic is not mentioned and we will conclude the thing is that everyone must reap the result of his past karma the past Karma one must admit the influence of tendencies inherited from past births and result of the product akarma he is mentioning about proud of the nevertheless in that dilapidated house I saw the face of the goddess radiating a divine light one must believe in the divine presence in the image one must believe in the divine presence in the image so that is the next again we will read from the passages now this karma phala we have already done something in our past and so all these things are happening this is a vast subject we may discuss in the our next class about this karma phala now serrano krishna mentioned about the prayer of the Karma bra aur ab de poobah are up there that means in the past we have done something now we are actually enjoying all suffering those Karma's that skull prarabdha but in the hindu scripture they say we are having three bags about the Karma one is a gamma a gamma means do this do the bag that I am carrying and whatever work I am doing in this life presently the result is going into that bag and now sitting over there another back full is there it is not open it has not been opened yet and that is called San cheat and cinch it means we all know we have already collected kept in that and the zipper is tight we have not opened it in our next life maybe that zipper will open all things will start coming out and that will be termed as far up there and product there is this one now in the magazine so many bullets are there all those bullets that we can call son Jett is all stored but not used now I have just fired it pushed the tigger one bullet went out that is called prarabdha it has already gone out I cannot control it I don't have any control over that particular bullet which has already been fired from the gun but in my bag there are other bullets so which in different pockets wherever I am getting the supply of the ammunition and keeping over there and that is called Agha me too agha me sanchit and produkter if possible in our next class we will discuss about that let us conclude need an journal medium anantara bum but on compa Drita become babe yavitt autumn but amisha medium Tom morongo krishnam sheer asana mama Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that's it sri ramakrishna our eponymous to thank you for coming
