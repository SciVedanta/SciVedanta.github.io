[90. Panchama Veda 90 : Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-FHxQ32ygI)

2g venom go vvd return calm ha ha hum 7 among de la cima da tha tum ho beginnin oh god and aha again we will listen to the wonderful miss discussions the ceramic ish nuh is having with the devotees and here we find the excellent example that God is not accepting everyone whoever is coming so that is very very important for us to note the one person has come and he is holding the toes of vagabonds Ramakrishna and he is a devoted person he is holding the toes and praying and apparently his gesture his behavior everything shows that he is dedicated to God and he wants to get the blessings of God the grace of God but ceramic ISNA he suddenly said to the Divine Mother in his own mode mother take him away as if someone is bothering and he is asking the mother to take him away he is the Guru he is the jagadguru and naturally his so much of compassion his love his affection and his concern for the devotees but still he is saying taking maybe why so we are here we are little bit confused and hesitant also what will happen to us here we find that the person master SE tu kidhar your mind is still attracted to worldly things the ego and the attraction for the worldly things at the same time apparently we are showing devotion it cannot go together rom even come this do not do not go together the desire for the worldly name fame bodily comfort and all these at the same time I say that I will realize God that and go together one person whenever he comes he shows that he is a great devotee and he says that I have seen the sea Ramakrishna is dancing I kept quiet because his behavior is not showing that so it is a shot of her the show up hypocrisy so that is what ceramic ISNA perhaps telling about this person and beyond the forest he is telling inspiring him go beyond go beyond go beyond because that story of that the brahmacari and he is telling your mind is still attracted towards the worldly things what is the use of saying you don't care for it what is the use of saying that you don't care for it we have to be genuine we have to be guide 'less we have to be free can we deceive God who can see everything who can understand everything what a foolishness so that is why it is better to come and surrender and totally like a guyless so if he comes and says I have committed wrong I am doing wrong I am very very weak I cannot control my mind and passions but you please save me whatever is good please do that to mean that is the only way to get this salvation and see Rama Krishna is telling you have come to God thinking about God is good but don't stop over there march on and on on and he is stirring like this beyond the forest of sandalwood there are many more things minds of silver gold diamonds and other precious stone having a glimpse of spirituality don't think you have attained everything a glimpse of spirituality that on hell whom he is telling ceramic asian is very sincere and that is why he won't say anything just to pacify you some people okay okay that will do not not like that he's very very and that's why he said the Guru were three types one simply say don't bother about whether that disciples are following it or not another will try inquire but the third one the best guru he is very very sincere again and again he is trying to bring his disciple his children into the path of God why because he has seen God he has realized God and at the same time he has realized the folly of this mundane world and that is why he is so straightforward he is so clear there is no ambiguity in his teaching your mind is still attracted towards the worldly things and why what is the use of saying you don't care for it one person came to see Ramakrishna and he told sir I do not like to pray for God realization spiritual development I want money Sri Ramakrishna was happy why because is free he is not deceiving whatever I am I am I am your child I am your son so that way when we are approaching then there is no problem so that is the reason he is telling like this and then describing his own life there he is telling I was like a happy pigeon I used to frequent only happy families in the happy families where people are happy God also come over there but the people are not happy they are constantly fighting with each other criticizing others and the bad way of leaving in the Buddhist the teaching also in the eighth that part's that he is showing that he is telling the life should be in the household the life should be very clear I love to visit the free eating places that means the place where the monks is to come and the rich people this to arrange their food there's a free eating places Dada mashallah as in our country they say doll mashallah the rich people they will bring food for the holy people and they distribute them so there he used to go why I could easily add there he is too holy men and would watch them for hours the Holy mean they come over there and see Rama Krishna is telling I I used to watch them for hours how they are sitting how they are behaving what are the books they are reading Ramayana and Mahabharata I was very fond of Ramayana bhagavata I could easily emitted them the wind their reading and the way they are reading that Oh everything then afterwards I Ramakrishna was very fond of songs and he asked some devotees to sing and ramla he is saying then afterwards sri ramakrishna is telling that a person is asking sad is it necessary to have a guru up to this we read we discussed in the last time that this is also that Nita and Leela we know that nithya and lela lela me is all this manifestation and need to me is only one the God is one without any second so that is called nithya that is the truth eternal unchangeable then what is all this Vedanta says it is illusion is Maya but the devotee said no this is also the other way manifestation of God the same God has manifested himself in this way so they are telling like this and we will read afterwards that this is nita and Leela said is it necessary to have a guru how we will know that what is Nick then what is Leela how we will know that among these all varieties there is God how we will know that all these varieties they are so real to us but in truth in reality it is not real in reality this is not real we think in so many different ways but inheriting this is not real so how to understand that so there see Ramakrishna Stella yes many need a guru guru means the preceptor the hall is the people have doubt the human with whom we are all the time leaving whom we know how can he guiders takers to God and therefore this questions I have read all these books I know so many things why should I have to have the somebody's guidance so that is the problem that is the reason this questions again and again coming up and see Ramakrishna is very clear in answering yes many need a good he is not only reason everyone need a good but mainly degree you but a man must have faith in the Guru's words the words means the teaching that the Guru has given different people who teach me differently once I have accepted a guru I must accept his words otherwise it is of no use in there it says that in the master Marsha in his original that kaatham Burton bengali immediately after this word he is giving a reference from bhagavad-gita 6th chapter 10 sloka yogi young gita saturday at mana maha cystica akaki hitachi Kozma me Rasheeda aprica constantly practice concentration yogi should constantly practice concentration yogi yunji de SATA autumn onam raha cci then he should retire into solitude a cocky alone with the mind and body subdued and free from hope and position opera graha and nearer she he is not having any hope asha near asha nearer she asha means home near Asha is no hope the Nira are she weed out any hope hope for what and nothing is going to happen to me these and the never bothers and what is this day with the holy day the auspicious deed is that ultimate person he never bothers about anything because constantly taking the name of God remembering God then the Holy Day special they what is that to him the ramachandra constantly remembering this hour hanuman ji remembering Sri Ramachandra then someone asked what is the special occasion today but i don't care i do not know for me Rama and I constantly remember Rama so this is the special day that we worship specially there is only for the very ordinary people and constantly putting the mind on god is it possible for everyone that's why master machine immediately given note below this one the 6th chapter tains look up the Bhagavad Gita it is possible those who can do it but it is not so easy for each and every one to practice this so that is why they are mentioning this yogi yunji tersa tata at monomer Ozzie constantly putting the mind on god and all alone without any company without any craving without any desire if you can do that you don't need got the guru but to reach up to that stage you need the guide to reach up to that state you need the guide and who can be good chanda go pony should say Archer Yvonne purusha Acharya Vaughn who is a GUI does the Italian that those who are teacher they know better they know what God they know the arc money and then only he is capable to become God so that is why it says a brahmananda ji said you better examine guru vicar are accepting before accepting the person as a guru he tried to examine he tried to know him as Tim you must accept an ostrich shifting there is nothing constantly list ninja you need not to follow his lifestyle but his words that he is again in a group and see Ramakrishna steering sachidananda is the truly such cheat on under saru body is the Guru because guru this power is there who can remove the ignorance it is not so easy and ignorance comes from ego and that is the root of my our birth and that ego is coming carrying all the impressions of the previous births also our desires our everything all these impressions carrying again and again and so many birds we are carrying that the huge a B load who can remove that only God can do that nobody else but what is this and see ramakrishna is telling even if tree can be God the tree be God in the knishes we find the story that the brim mature is going out with the cows and the teacher said go on remembering that you are the pure one you are the sachidananda suruba you are the Brahman you are the art man you are the pure one only one go and remember and win these 100 cow become 1000 then come back or 1000 become 10,000 then only come back go that is the instruction saranna manana needed the asana that is a way of be romantic teaching I tell you this now it is up to you you have to find out from within yourself the truth so that person the boy with all faith with all attention with all the love for his guru devotion for his guru he has said I'll surely realizing goes and he is merged in that alone constantly remembering about I am the Holy I am the Holy I am the all bruh said one and constantly suddenly he heard a bull is telling him now we are one thousand the number is full we can return back to your guru he is not counting and that bull is teaching him this is that this is that is it possible why not some people will be telling is it possible why not if God is all-powerful if God is everywhere can he not manifest his power through that animal it is also possible it can manifest its power through that animal and it is not imagination it is true some people they are hearing from the tree they go and meditate that the tree is God they will be going on meditating on that tree as God and the suddenly the tree speaks and instructs and we have here we read this type of instances in the Bible in the Quran the bushes from the bushes the words are coming why from the bushes or the person he was sacrificing his best thing his most beloved son he was sacrificing for the god suddenly the bush told no you need not to do that I was only examining you why from the bush what is this bush the same thing when he human firm speaks about God is that such Eden and the true him is speaking about God so that is why the Gerudo in a human form it is only the image and nothing else that is why see Ramakrishna he is telling anything can be your guru if the God is giving you his grace through anything and there is a beautiful story that how it is possible if you have the unshakable faith in the words of Guru even an image can teach you and that we find in the story of the e Columbia equilibria he was the ordinary person at naughty boy he wanted to learn archery from the rona the famous teacher in those days the story from Mahabharata and the Drona that story goes like this he like Arjuna and he wanted that in the whole India that in mah bah bharath versa the best archer should be Arjuna when the this ecolab you came to the dronacharya Drona doughnut or no I cannot teach you I owned but the Drona though he say the Guru said I won't teach you the disciple who came from the jungle he returned back to jungle with a decision he is my guru and i am going to learn from my guru he made an image of that food or something of donut area you know that you never knew that but he made that image of the Dronacharya accepting him as a guru he kept that image in under a tree and started practicing the archery and then one day came when the dená charia came along with his royal desire cuz Arjuna and all others and he founded wonderful tricks of the archery he called that boy who are you I am I kolhapure whose disciple he were said your disciple but I never saw you I don't know that you are my disciple I didn't teach you anything no you have taught through this image he took that do not charia before that image dronacharya was taken aback they a wonderful faith that's why I ramakrishna is telling it is the faith your own faith we drag the power of God will bring the power of God through anyone but you have to have the tremendous faith in that word of the Guru so this is when that person asked is it necessary to have a guru Sri Ramakrishna sterling yes it is necessary then he is telling but one cannot achieve anything through laziness people who desire worldly enjoyment say about it spiritual progress well it will all happen in time we shall realize God some time or other some people they feel that they are intelligent they feel that they understand many thing and they will say I don't believe in God what happens to me we don't say anything at least I do not answer god knows what will happen to you so this is a way they say that if they forget before birth where they where do they know that no do they know after their death well if they are going to go know how can you claim that you know everything just ego is speaking and what is that ego that is the binding force a mother keeps on cooking while the baby is in bed sucking its toy but when it throws up with a toy and cries for her she puts down the rice pot and takes the baby in her arms and nurse it it is said that in the cali yoga if a man can weave for God one day and one night he sees him that is what see Ramakrishna is telling feel at us to God and say to him you have created me now you must reveal yourself to me whether we're where you live in this world or elsewhere any anyway fix your mind on god so that is the way that is the reason I always call the khatam Rita the gospel of ceramic ISNA as the punch em aveda as the beta is teaching the about the God about the self the art Minh and in this real way because they realized because the Rishi's they realized and they spoke similarly the God Himself the God in the form of sri ramakrishna in this modern age is so clear about the ignorant are like people living in a house with a clay walls there is very little light inside and they cannot see outside but those who enter the world after attaining the knowledge of God are like people living in a house made of glass they also leaving the house but they can see outside they can see inside they know the Foley the temporariness of the external world and at the same time they know what is true what is in eternal nothing exists except the one that one is the supreme Brahman so long as he keeps I in us he reveals to us that he who as the prime energy creates preserved destroyed the universe he is tipping the eye in us that is the ego that is why we cannot see that which is Brahman is also the primal energy the manifestation is from the primal energy so that is the reason we go and touch the feet of the senior people why because within them the manifestation of the primal energy senior respected people holy people the people who are thinking and doing good to others we go and pay our respect to them why mateur listicle e if we judge they may not be in the same level of many others the scientists are many others are there who are greatly highly qualified people while then they comment as the feet of a religious person because the manifestation of God in that person is more that is the reason the Brahman is the primal energy Brahman at the end the primal energy at first appear to be too but after attending the knowledge of Brahman one does not see the two then there is no differentiation it is one without a second adwaita non-duality the excellent way of teaching that Veda adwaita this is we here we practice and we propagate advaitha so that is the reason our everything is too little different from others not much of importance in the ritualistically thing that is also important ritual istics are also important but if we know that when a person coming and knocking our door ringing the bell whatever may be the time we are supposed to go and open why he is coming to God he is not coming to me I cannot simply close it and say no go away it is now we can say now the temple is closed maybe you have to wait a little but please come do you like to have a cup of coffee or do you like a glass of tea or water or here is our bookstore you can spend some time why he is coming to God that is why again and again I always try to say this is the call of God that bring a person otherwise the worldly attraction is so strong millions and millions people how many they come to God and particularly to the true philosophy that is Vedanta when you go to the Hindu temple there are so many other occasions are there you can perform the final rites of your diseased people you can perform so many other things like the marriages and so people they go that is also necessary but that is only primary unless and until we know the other day I think study one gentleman came he is belonging to a very strong party in India they are also having a big good number over here and they are supporting the Hindu cause they came to meet me in the devotee and he has respect for the holy people particularly the followers of the bacon onda so when I was talking with it I told him this is the thing that we must learn here also if we simply arrest ourself ourself bound by only ritual stick thing we don't make anything else then we won't be able to make any progress will be just like the children going on playing and playing and neighbor becoming a match your thinking person so that is the reasons Ramakrishna is telling Brahman and primal energy appears as to all these people that we see sometimes we are telling don't come to us you are not allowed calm this is the only thing I will do are you really telling the truth do you know what you are telling that is the question we have to ask and that is why the gospel of ceramic ISNA is so important to read one must study the gospel of the ramakrishna many people I am NOT receiving the letters from different people they went to so many different faiths and after ultimately when they came and read this gospel of ceramic ISNA they are so satisfied we have got the answer we are really encouraged we now know what is this so that is why it is so important to know the master was very happy to see a musician why because you see that highest philosophy is telling whatever you see is nothing but the manifestation of God siddharth sharma vivek and is telling and that to standing on the soil of the South India very very devoted and Orthodox people dear he is telling before the image before the temple of the Krishna is telling you like to worship Krishna go to that place where the poor the illiterate the downtrodden are leaving go and worship them and your Krishna here inside the temple will be happy in the bhagavata also it says like this he is telling his mother the you people are worshipping only externally and by that way not understanding me properly rather harming me in the day Baruti to devahuti the capella he is telling you're harming you are not doing it properly you are constantly thinking in this way this is very very wrong so so important this is so he says and he saw the musician and actor musician to sing why through the song through the music the devotion Rises he spoke about the knowledge he spoke about the guiana at Rita and immediately he is going to the devotion this is the most important spatial in the life of Sri Ramakrishna we have seen many people they are when they're in one sphere in the gianna in the game path of knowledge they are there rather they are criticizing other paths but here it is see Ramakrishna he is telling talking about the Advaita Vedanta that there is known to there is only one Shami become the said each and every soul is nothing but the manifestation of the divinity the divine nature is already there only thing it is in a potential stage not that outer emotion they are telling we have to go and sub the poor not out of emotion out of the realization realizing that the same one the same God the same Brahman the same para magma is manifested has manifested in so many ways so many forms that is the excellent way of talking about the Vedanta one cannot see God unless Maya steps aside from the door so it's so easy one cannot see God unless the Maya steps aside if we are ceramic is not mentioned that it is only one and the manifestation through the primal energy and the Brahman are originally one naturally the question comes if it is so we are the created things of the primal energy in that case why we cannot understand it immediately is giving the answer he is telling one cannot see God unless the Maya steps aside from the what is this Maya no one can explain but you can feel what is that feeling we are always attracted towards the temporary things that which will never exist that which is imaginary that we cannot give us the permanent happiness we are so much attracted to all those things is our experience now if you ask yourself if you ask the question yourself why am i attracted to all this I cannot control my mind the answer is Maya that is the illusion as if this is why because of the illusion what is the solution Maya what is this Maya again the power of God why the God has kept this Maya then the answer is it is divine sport Leela so this is the way it goes and but the Maya steps aside from the door when God shows his grace to the devotee if it is so that because of the Maya we cannot see God realize God then how come that someone is releasing God and His claiming that i have seen God his life totally changed and he says that I have realized God and we believe in him how it is possible when the Maya is closing the door in between God and man how a person can realize God how the Maya is going away when God yummy Bishop bring new teeth in Olympia in the Veneti he says don't think you are trying you are taking the name of God you are meditating you have left your hearth and home and become among a bong or you are a very pious and only person don't think that God will do is bless you no not like there is no the condition unconditional and if he thinks that he will bless you he will bless you the moment he braces you what happens immediately you see all that was attracting you binding you dragging you down revoked immediately just be the clans that's why I ramakrishna stealing when a dark room if you light a lamp what happens in the dark room the moment you lighten them immediately all darkness goes away it's not that little little the darkness will go in at a glance to monomer aside because from the door when God gave to the devotee when the vesian stands visitor stands before the door the doorkeeper says to the master ser commanders and and we shall let him pass by giving an example there are two schools of thought see Ramakrishna never study but are educated people because used to go to keep quiet and talking about this wonderful things but most of the time we go and we talk and let them listen so naturally they're closed so they cannot talk among themselves or between them so here he says there are two schools of thought Vedanta and the piranhas karana means devotion according to be danced with this world is a framework of illusion that is to say it is an illusory like a dream some people the doubt his salam Krishna God even some of our monastic members also sometimes they feel why should we have to talk to Ramakrishna so about Saddam o Krishna so highly it's Ramakrishna god what if our people and they have they're spending their life in the start why because they don't read gospel and even when they read unfortunately because the god is not gracious of them that darkness has not gone the faith has not come the believers not developed and the intellect is not clear that that is the reason began to according to be done to this world is a framework of illusion that is to say it is all illusory like a dream but according to karana the books of devotion God himself has become the 24 cosmic principles the last Sunday we were discussing about that the twin three principles the many of us we do not know that philosophy Patsy Ramakrishna knew though he'd never read and twenty four principles he knew very clearly worship God both within and without that is his own teaching God is within God is one and all that you see is illusory it is also true it is true because from the point of view of the Vedanta the Baron thing they have realized this and it is true ceramic is not denying at the same time he is telling there is another viewpoint is also there that is the devotion and in devotion they say God has manifested in so many different ways and today in this Kali Yuga at the present age it is better to accept in that way and that is why Swami Vivekananda he introduced on ish work for each and every one and this is the first time in the history of the religious world that the devotee is the householders and the mongs both are practicing austerity trying to realize God in the same way in the same manner karma yoga when a person is cooking something and bringing over here he is thinking I am NOT going to feed people i am going to feed the god sometimes i observed some devotee they bring food and at the same time they invite their own relatives and friends i am he feeding today you also come they all came they enjoyed the social social all these mixtures were their devotion I am sorry I may not be may God bless them is now I have no problem but according to this system they are thinking I am feeding to whom people and people should appreciate people should say wrong very very wrong when I am offering it to god I am so humble whose food is this who has given you money who has created all these things you know is wrong so this is called bichara in the way of devotion this bechari this judgment this discrimination should be there and when you are opposing this discrimination just the same thing you are cooking very ordinary thing but with that ordinary action because your mind is pure constantly thinking of God attentive to God I am cooking for God and the people who will come there devotees within their heart God is sitting they will eat they will be happy God will be happy that is the only way and that is called Karma Yoga unless and until that karma yoga is perform it is impossible and that is why see Rama Krishna is telling in the according to the devotional path God himself has become 24 cosmic principle worship God both within and without when you are worshipping God within we close our eyes we try to visualize God within our heart and we don't like to talk to anyone we don't like to mix with anyone we want the solitude we won the loneliness we want to drag all our mind scattered mind from every object within and then we offer that mind open that mind fought the manifestation of god that is Vedantic way also devotion and at the same time how long we practice this meditation one hour two hours three hours four hours eight hours ten hours some people they claim but difficult to believe but and suppose even you are doing that even twenty fourteen hours are left 1mon came to Jamaica mirin and the G and he told Shami g last 10 or 12 years I am working I didn't get any vacation in the inner inner in our monastic order is a huge order different type of job responsibilities so monks are posted in different categories and naturally sometimes they don't get the vacation if that is a constant duty so he came and he was telling please give me at least three months leave I want to call on God and gummy rhinology quietly said this 13 years you didn't serve God and remember god and can you make up within three months this is the excellent we he was Abaddon team gamma on the G Swami gambar under his books are there he was Abaddon team but the Vedanta means the Vedanta practiced realized and expounded by ceramic ISNA be waken under this is the why we are different this ceramic ation of Vivekananda we are the followers of ceramic ISNA be bacon under what is the speciality is Ramakrishna Vivekananda they realized the truth they practiced it in their own life and they propagated the same philosophy for the betterment of the ordinary people what is that see God worship God within and without that is what see Ramakrishna said and then as long at God's keep the awareness of I so long do same subjects exist the someone weren't telling the win all these external things are there why it is there this is the answer I went to Cleveland and there someone was asking me though if this is illusion how come that all these things are existing my grandfather saw them my father saw them I am seeing them how can you just simply deny it because all the three generation you are having the ignorance about the reality don't mind but that is the truth if you want to know the truth that is the truth why I cannot see God in every being why all these things are still so much attracted to me because I is there so clear see I'm Krishna's teaching is so clear those who were sincere they will never judge whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim or Christian or but these this is for the spiritual development arrow so this spiritual development it says as long as God keeps the awareness of I mutt the world as long as God keeps the eye i am trying to eradicate I and my tribe should be one hundred percent sincere and then along with my try if God is gracious on me and removes that then only it is possible then some people to see if God is doing everything even is all predestined why should I have to work what should I have to try because of this by doing that we are getting the attention of God again ceramic ISNA in some other places we will listen that story he is explaining a cow was tired and his robe had maybe 20 feet and in the 20 feet radius the cow could eat but the cow was seeing some green glasses beyond the 20 feet grid radius and he was trying his best to reach over there and his owner saw the poor cow is trying constantly to reach over there and green grasses are there then he came and okay okay he extended the row up to another maybe under 10 feet maybe another 10 feet extension the cow God that is called the grace of God and we were striving crying praying practicing austerity doing the charity giving the charity all these things when you are doing just like that our strive attract the gods attention ok I am coming what do you want I want your field I want to see you I want to talk to you I want to realize you and I want to know who iam I the moment we say I want to know who am I approach from the Vedanta the when i say i want to see you oh god that in my Creator is the approach from the bhakti but the result is both the same both the result would be the same see ramakrishna the buckler sees that he is god has also become maya again this is a very new word what is Maya the god himself he himself has become the universe and all its living beings the bhakto si is God Maya universe and the living being as one I let me repeat this the buckler sees God Maya universe and the living being as one is this ceramic ISNA is just telling as an intellectual person no those who have read the biography of ceramic ISNA you can remember the incident see Ramakrishna saw he is telling I saw one day the goddess in sitting in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple the Holy goddess the image of ma goddess Kali and the doorstep and a cat and they bad character lady all of same can you imagine just telling on do you have to realize it so when he saw these then all things were removed so the God and the Maya these devotees the manifestation all are nothing but the same same devotees see everything as Rama it is Rama alone who has become everything if only the so-called followers of ramachandra so-called followers of sri krishna so called the hindus we could understand these there then why this cast ism why these brahmana and should draw why these you don't come to me and I won't go to you why this I am holier than thou attitude because you don't understand this we only worked through the emotion in this life of Shankar Acharya it is all there and at the same time see Rama Krishna who was the brahmana himself and so pure a brahmana he is telling the devotee and if you cannot see that the drama has become everything then you cannot claim yourself as devotee you are only trying to become a devotee so it is clearly he is telling he himself has become everything the devotees say it is Rama alone who has become everything some sees everything as Radha and Krishna to them it is Krishna alone who has become the 24 cosmic principles it is like seeing everything green through a green glasses he mentioned about the Rama he mentioned about the Krishna 22 very popular God so that is why the Rama and the Krishna and anything that you are worshipping nothing wrong but don't say it is only within this frame within this image and there it ends is very wrong so that is why we must have to learn like this then he is telling bhakti scripture at means the manifestation of power are different in different beings why so different a brahmana and kshatriya Andy Beshear and a sudra what is the difference manifestation next class we will study like that and he his ramakrishna will be talking about aight ty of bondages that is tying down binding down each and every one and we cannot get the liberation the eight fighters in the next day you study that need an gentleman eat'em on antelope um Bob Donna compa Drita become be ye chaahat arum parami she medium Tom Ramakrishna meeeee Shira sana mama oh shanthi shanthi shanthi hurry hume thats it sri ramakrishna our eponymous to tomorrow you
