[225: Panchama Veda 225 : Sri Ramakrishna- Ways and Means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKWmnd_3_kk)

double katana rhythm doctors even a creepy rhythm Cosmo shavon shavon among column three madam boobie grinning da Buddha da da da now we were reading from the Gospel of a bounce around Krishna and it was the page number 588 and it is the account of the day the Thursday October 2nd 1884 Master Dogen C Ramakrishna he was discussing about the mental condition of the child under mahaprabhu Jatin Mahdi used to experience three moons in the inmost mode he would be observed in Samadhi unconscious of the outer world in the semi-conscious mode cute dance in ecstasy but could not talk in the conscious mood she would sing the glories of God so these are the three points many times we have heart we discussed because this is the the be daunting they always try to prove this they prove this but there is a Hartman there is consciousness and this consciousness is proved by this condition three what is that juggler Sapna and Suzuki now shaitana mahaprabhu when conscious is singing the glory of God the singing the glory of God miss is talking as because when the people constantly meditating on God they cannot think of anything else except God they cannot talk anything here except God so tight anima Prabhu a man like him and the incarnation of God now obviously he is thinking about God constantly and when he's conscious he's talking about God we can remember shameeka Mira and the G one of the presidents of the billiard-room distribution here's my son - good sir we never used to talk used to talk about the spiritual as because he used to read scripture all through his life we lived and then he translated almost all that who punishes and brahmasutra so thoughts where only spiritual whenever adopt normal talking also the scripture so here when the commands Ramakrishna is telling that in a conscious state chaitanya mahaprabhu is to single a glory of god means is to talk to the people that was this conscious stage then you will notice that even the doctors the singers the people with profession and they love their profession whenever there is an opportunity whenever there they are talking with the frames even they'll be talking on particular subject on that topic so the spiritual personality like chaitanya mahaprabhu well this ramakrishna is mentioning sing the glory of god this is a conscious state and what is the conscious state it is the combination of the body and mind and of course the self consciousness semi-conscious dance in ecstasy so that is proved semi-conscious state we are in there we can say the shock now our stuff in the shop novice table there it is a conscious but not of the external consciousness but is the consciousness of something else that's the a very unique thing that happens to every human being almost every day and that was analyzed by the vidonne team so carefully so they came to this conclusion that there is a world a consciousness except the body even when the body is absent there is a consciousness there is the world and people could think about that so this sharpness did he dance in ecstasy but about the chaitanya mahaprabhu thus Ramakrishna what was their second stage they forgive their body and they always feel that there is the company of the god and they are dancing and expressing the joy of the company of the company of the spirit company of the consciousness so that this is the second stage which we can say this is a short nervous the ordinary people in the dream state they are not conscious about the body because the body is just inactive lying on the bed but their mind is fully active and they are enjoying or whatever maybe sometimes that bad dream they are suffering but for the personalities are with others of the high spiritual people like chaitanya mahaprabhu sri ramakrishna their semi-conscious they can't talk to the people worldly people because they cannot think of the world but they are physically active at the symptom as the phantom because Linda physically also but mentally they are completely of Libyan of the existence of this world so this is the second state semi conscious about sitar aeternam operable ceramic business mentioned and third is a completely in Samadhi what is the Samadhi complete union of the individual self with the supreme self the individual self and the supreme soul or the brahmana the waning mind like that the world is completely forgotten the body is completely forgotten existence all around for garden so that is called Samadhi state the people at the time of a woman serum Tichenor they have observed and there were scientist the doctors at the time of the Samadhi the doctors is to go and check Raghavan see Rama business body condition no breathing ha not only there's some time when doctor was there we used to put his finger on the eyeball of ceramic dish that you can understand so sensitive to the eyeball when you are bringing something me at the I immediately it'll blink to protect the iPod but that man is to touch the eyeball and there was no reaction in the body he'll be holding his hand to see whether he is breathing no and when he's tasting the chest whether he's breathing inside no no sign of life but the man is there so naturally these two wonder how it is possible and that was demonstrated in the modern day world in Calcutta by shri ramakrishna and the ceramic dish now he is explaining that chaitanya mahaprabhu also used to have this experience which is completely called Sosuke t it for the ordinary people ignorant people they go to that condition when there is no body consciousness when the mind is also absent because they don't see the dreams but at the same time they come back and they express that joy the one thing is very important when the people are coming back from the sushupti the dreamless sleep they never say we experienced pain or the servery no they always say we experience joy please each and every one that proves with on things they give the stress on that so the original condition is bliss joy and not misery and hence they have given the dictum Arnold Ivica Luke imani bhutani jayante clue they're assuring surely obviously from the Anandi from the joy the sources joy the on endure all this beings are coming and that is why each and every one of us particularly the human being we can understand we like to go to the jar to the Hanuman sometimes if you are making the puppy afraid the small little puppy and it will run away from you but when you are showing the affection giving the food or patting on the bed this soon happy bringing the tail and expressing the joy even that animals also the children with no content express their other feelings can understand the joy so India on the lap of other ladies they are trying the moment there on the lap of their own mother the very happy smiling and that expression of joy so we like the joy the happiness and we we are grown up we are conscious we are educated we can understand our goal is to get the joy through power through money through other things food baby but I do it goal is the joy so here it says the Sioux City when the ordinary people do go to that particular state we there is no consciousness of the body and no existence of the mind because we don't see any dream but we are alive and we get up from the sleep and sake we experience joy in the Vedanta body Varsha when they're giving subject matter of the Vedanta what is the subject matter for the ultimate subject of the Vedanta unification union of the Jeeva and the broth that is the ultimate subject of the Vedanta we the Manta the end of the knowledge what is that I am that feeling that great dictum they say that one I see that that is two on you that Brahman is you the third one I see you are that what you say that because there is no changer it is consciousness so that is why the consciousness is you how to prove that is the goal to you Vedanta see they also prove in this way such as Jeeva so I am the Colorado that individual cell is self emergent athma depot in the bhagavad-gita also the Shia majority that word is there you have to become self different you are solely cultured but this moment you have forgotten it and now under the guidance of your guru you have to develop technology where they will understand all those things that we are covering your mind and our wrong you are self-effulgent that individual self is self-effulgent in sanskrit it mentioned saw cha Jeeva Jeeva means individual self so I am Prakash self-effulgent it's not the help of anything else that knowledge the existence at ryeom Russia so I am Jyothi in the breeder and a Phoenician it says in this state the man himself becomes the light Raghavan cinema Tichenor in some places is dealing a time comes when the mind becomes your guru you need not to go to anyone else for your guidance we will get the guidance from your own mind the mind will say don't do this and do this and leave like this talk like this everything will be guided and sometimes in the life of xiaomi Vivekananda it has happened the Hever son we become used to think what I'm going to speak next day so many speeches in one day almost eight to ten speeches talks is to keep and in one place is he saved the ordinary people won't be able to do that they will emit blood if the tribe so much if there is no microphone so obviously he has to shout you can imagine and in different places and he used to travel by ordinary the cost on cars obviously - in that chord which he was not habituated so all of that scenario and he was going on talking to those people who had no idea about India and his blood our philosophy - what was been under the 30 who was there and when you stop telling them that you are the immortal being of the reaction of the masses now we have seniors how can you say that we are the pure heart no it is not possible so that mental condition is changing them if we read the speeches that was recorded much afterwards so many things so many speeches he already delivered no one was there to record but much afterwards so it some of the ladies they decided to appoint one person to note down his speeches wait then we are thankful to them and whatever we have got that is sufficient for us and each and every talk is different and but true every Turkey is giving the one idea you are God yourself here it says a triumph Russia saya me Jody in this state the man himself becomes the light in this tale what is that state when he forgives the body when he forgives the mind when he goes back to that consciousness he becomes the his own effulgence self it is knowledge itself propaganda Eva so they are quoting the began degree Varsha he is quoting from the Phoenicians the pram giancana Eva it is knowledge itself what is that knowledge the unification of the individual self and the brahmana what is Brahman consciousness now what happens when you reach to that state you become Raman the Brahman wave of apathy when you experience the knowledge of Brahman you on yourself so what is Deva then it concludes Shiva Pratibha mr. Chaitanya proceeding with the Chaitanya it is not the original thing but as a reflection but it is change them that is the consciousness which is reflecting and there is nothing else when the Sun is reflecting it is the Sun and only and that is the consciousness on our intellect where it is reflecting so what is so something that is the state and from there knowingly chaitanya mahaprabhu is to go into Samadhi in the third so ceramic isne is not talking to the devotees he is explaining and to the devotees you are listening to my words try to assimilate them this is very important now so many gurus are there the people they are visiting them and listening them but they do not assimilate their words each and every guru everywhere all the teachers they are teaching that you should be morally very high and should be faithful to your thoughts about the spirituality able to God and then you should strive to reach over there etc so many things majority of the people they go on listening all from their lives but name and assimilate but ceramic vishna he's giving stress on that committee weakened also said the way you are going on talking about God and the dawns and Dawn's of talking is better on one hours of practice just practice and how to practice assimilating what is there simulation understanding the truth of the teaching and then try to follow that in the life that is a simulation but how to understand the truth you have you must have to have some background otherwise it is not possible and what is that background that your mind should be free from the worldly thoughts so the way we are talking about the spirituality is completely different from the worldly thoughts when the people are so stupidly deep down into the worldly thoughts constantly thinking when the shared market will up and then these and that suddenly they come to the temple and listen to their target so I I know now the Vedanta now that is not possible so the ground should be ready otherwise the seed is not going to sprout and how to prepare the down that Shamma Lamma purity the diksha Sirte Samana the Ganther he says that these are the six things you must have to have and talk about Sudama krishna he said saju Sangha in one world he's a sahaja Santa go to the holy people who are living their lives in that way listen to them try to understand the meaning of the teachings and followed and what is that sadhu sanga teaches you only one thing God is there that's all if his Sajal do not believe existence of God or the supreme self then how can he teaches in that so that is why we must try to understand that this is not the full it is only limited this world that we see and those were in the particularly the scientific or this really very wondering but still not is limited we do understand that if the day they are discovering so many things even then this limited knowledge why because the next day is changing whatever they're discovering it is getting changed so that is the reason ceramic history is telling you are listening to my words try to assimilate them what we have heard 3 condition our star tire our starter sharp shield that three condition of chaitanya mahaprabhu and he entered in this way the ultimate thing is to march with the consciousness next day before that you are in this world but at the same time you are not and the last day is standing over here your body your mind you are conscious but at the same time your thoughts are constantly flowing towards the higher level Shami be waken the same to the blue materials the bongs you cannot always leave on the spiritual level and you should not go down to the physical level so you should have intellectual level the physical level intellectual level spiritual level so it is better to leave with that intellectual level for ordinary people and for children tomorrow living always in there but we is talking given the instructions advising the devotees that is is Gnostic but even then that is so high and he is physically mentally conscious giving that rises but that too is so high for us we won't be able to reach over there unless we practice unless we try unless we love to go at dusk put aside all duties and pray to God this is a wonderful teaching supper one see Ramakrishna at dusk moment the evening is approaching forget about all of the things and put your mind to God pray to God what is reminded of him by darkness in those days of course and now also in the modern society had to approach of the darkness one things I could see everything a moment ago who has brought about this change so day and night day is all we can see and there is a time everything goes into oblivion we cannot see it is the change the great chain understanding this change that is coming every day every moment in our life we must be careful we should not waste our time so put your mind on that one gentleman his name is Mukherjee he is asking a question revered sad is it good to break this chopper is asking that this is good to practice chopper and look at the answer Raghavan Saddam equation is telling yes one attains God through Japan I have marked that line yes one attains God through Japan so in this modernist condition we cannot meditate as the people's to do in the olden days it is not possible so we had born in this condition and all these things all around we have to supply we have to live we have to drive the car we have to do so many other things the wind it is time for us to meditate so that jabber jabber jabber that's why mansoura the money baby is also telling about city jihad city jihad city and what is this Java Java is the name of God only name of God usually the tradition in the tradition with this tradition they accept this particular name name of God from a guru who is practicing that particular God's name in his own life and of course he should have other qualities like unselfishness love he is desired free and these are the qualities of the person and he is completely free that that type of person if you find if you take the name God's name from me and go on taking that name repeating the name you will surely realize sometimes on people they'll be asking this is possible to realize God see the answer yes one attends God through Japan by repeating the name of God secretly and in solitude one receives divine grace if the people they are practicing it a little refinement immediately how the mind is changing and we can just try and nothing hard when trying nothing and we are not going to drink anything or we are not going to Spain the money for this no nothing just take the name of God in solitude and on with the faith that God is there and it it prayer the God please reveal thyself to me see after few days how your mind will change thoughts will change and the moment you are changing a little all at most will change the people will start loving you they will start to help you to give give you the gift and all these things that that proves that God is there the moment God is there God is nothing but love so obviously those who are practicing the meditation and revealing the God within themselves the honorable people they are forced to love him a heart who is practicing so this he says secretly in solitude one receives the divine grace then comes his region suppose there is a big piece of timber lying under the water and first turned to the land the chain by proceeding along the chain linked by the in with at last touch the timber he is giving the wonderful example we can't see God like a timber underwater but there is a chain and time with that and shame can be followed on the bank of the river so now the Guru says all this chain and go link my thing he will reach to the timber activate and then go link I think that we stick the name of God he will have the region so that ways in our vision are very wonderfully you stealing it is possible it is possible only two things you have to have the faith in the existence of God and also in the words of your guru and second a sincere a forward to reach to God so these two things and then he is telling her then worship is Jabba now he is giving the gradation higher than worship when you were doing the external puja maturity of 90 percent of our mind goes to see whether all the ingredients are there or not things are there or not and then so many other things that they're prescribed in the book when you are doing the puja your finger should be like this you should take the bells you take this light you should throw the flower like this way and you should heart at the mantra in this is so many so many things again and again again and again here to repeat and when we were doing that most of our mind going like that so fast without doing the worship what we are going to do here going and talking with the frames chatting these are new newspaper are doing this attack it is better to worship comparing it those things better to worship when you are worshipping you mind is at least in that condition and then he says better than worship is japa when you are taking the name of God you are not careful about what he is having sometimes some of the devotees they will say Tommy you win we are counting the name of gods our mind is distracted so what should we do shall we not count the names or just simply repeat the name of God what is better why we ask them to count the name of God because you do not know when your mind has gone out so we have a county that means your mind will be at least very close to that sometimes you see your finger is just lying over here this is the wonderful way they count it's not the simple way there's a tantric we're counting and naturally you should be careful or how many times I've my guru say that you should do that a thousand times that is only five Haeundae I have to practice the death impetus that is helped me slowly slowly when you become adjusted with there you need not to count in that way just go on repeating the name of God and trying to Vishal which your lives he is pictured with in your heart and when you are trying to visualize the picture he is sitting on a beautiful Lotus and nothing is there but E and obviously you are forgetting your body consciousness so you are seeing that the light and the falchion lying that is emanating from the holy personality person after God and he looks at you like this and you are just trying to imagine visualize that you're forgetting the body and mind your mind is becoming concentrated and you are taking the name of god oh god oh god oh god so naturally is better now higher than chakra is meditation whose name you are taking God's name and when the God is revealing himself within your heart the English not to take his name you are just enjoying his closeness and his beauty is the presence of the God in your heart and then you don't see the heart you see the God is just in front of you and naturally the name of God doesn't matter because that is the God sitting before you you are offering food to God the Hindus they say this is the time you should do worship through mental puja monastic pooja - pooja mother's means thus adjust your thinking you are washing the feet of the Lord and then you are putting the curl burning the incense sticks waving the light offering the food and God is also eating and talking to you you are just in the presence of God so that is the way you are meditating so first is worship completely external then jabba this is subtle in the mind then meditation you whole mind is concentrated on particular object and better than meditation is the power what is the power of this even in marching with the God then the gods is come we will walk you are just going with of God talking with him and you are in the presence of God only joy joy and joy you don't see anything else but the joy the light so that is called power and power then the problem Mohammed the prema what is the mahabhava oneness with God and that oneness in God is expressed through love so what is God that's how seanyb began the same in OBE what is God love you sometimes some people in the name of God asked to torture others I wonder whatever God they're thinking about God can never be like that God is nothing but prema that is love and when there is love it never sees the differences you and me it cannot be love means only I everything is nothing but the car oneness the here prema love of God when it is intense and spontaneous is called Raja bhakti raga bhakti in Sanskrit our AG a resonance attachment raaga dvesha they were all the time.they Wittering delecia is opposite to raga raga means attachment here the bhagavata means we cannot think anything but God anything but God so once a once around Krishna's father pseudonym chapter birthday he used to worship God with the green buildings and sometimes in the they'll only be any leaf available that way or dry heaves so one thing he was going to some place he worked almost five to ten miles to reach to the destination suddenly he saw a small tree bend tree full of green bay leaves and he was so fond of doing the worship of the Shiva with those beliefs now he forgot about going to this destination he immediately collected all the buildings from there a huge number came back the fire again the five miles walking back and then we for bathing without eating anything he built he worshiped Shiva after that is it okay now I moved the love for God that is called raga worthy anything else except God is absent in his mind he will never care about the tiredness of the body he forgives about the body his joy though I could collect this thing because my God loves is I love God so this is called rather of the anything and everything that you'll be doing only thinking that God is there God is present God is enjoying I am only with the God that is called a devotee so this rather work Teresa in Marshall of the manatee be she will every time Ramakrishna katha prana Tanana burn-up Rihanna that Baba Ranjit are Arum in the meditation of Marcia of the Mona Devi these three words are be used salaam vishna gotta prana her mind was constantly thinking of tsunamis and nothing else each and everything that she saw talked to it helped assert only saddam additional and nothing else the when people they talk that select marshals the money who used to serve the poor Amjad and these are their mana his only cinema krishna only externally it was that Amjad maybe there's somebody else who is conditioner serrano krishna cutter prana and then if anyone taking the name of Sudama krishna she's always giving the blessings ramakrishna got the prana tongue novice ravana pre-owned she was so happy if anybody is taking or talking about the Ramakrishna following the teachings of ceramic is not this way she assured don't be afraid I am with you real mother when nobody is around when you feel that nobody is there to help you just call me mother and I will be there so that is that sure but if you dig the name of Parganas ramakrishnan tell mother ma I need these she is sure what happy ramakrishna gotta prana her soul was nothing but life was nothing but scum Tichenor and only thing that she loved is the name of Salaam o Krishna Rama fish- Pranav and namaz Roberto Priam thought power and Jada akka harem about the power what is the power of Ramakrishna will discuss this point a little later here we come - and the hot rod entered the room the master was stealing the love of God when it is intense and spawned ten years is called the raga web team and breathing empathy we develop thee is it you have to practice this so even we do that with these are the things that you must practice in the books it is there you must sit like these if I do these must do that and that we agree not with love but just as the practice and you must have to follow that is one thing but the other work thing Shami be recommended he'll be offering the food to hug Avanti Ramakrishna he is just boosting pushing the plate to the that picture and said carlo that my friend take the food and in Hindi they say yeah here means the frame hallelujah Sutra which is pooja used to worship like that you would be on the plate all people is to be so careful and for sharmaji you push the plate towards the picture of ceramic Eastham zocalo you take it from here friend that's all no mantra nothing so that is why we have to understand the limitations where I am and where are those people and if we just like Swamiji we also say kaleriya do you think it was accepted not because II you don't have that love we don't have the feeling of oneness the rather of thee and we in the one in that condition you have understood that there is nothing but C Ramakrishna and I am also bad we accept cinema Beach to the God the supreme the consciousness the brahmana nothing is there I too am so so - at this moment in this body I appeared to be different but I'm not then I can say yeah oh wait frame for my power that is like that responsible here is Ramakrishna is tailing then he says and Hegira now he is expressing army cause it's so good is listening to them a sinner Krishna bringing life because Asura's motives to change constantly when he's so close to star Krishna listen to him influenced by him you'd be saying sometimes like that part he was very egoistic and because of the ego a neighbor good accepts damn additional we find this here the power of cinema busines one day I was returning from the Pine Grove when I saw you taking your beads to hot rod ceramic business taking hostage to see me enter the gate I say to the divine mother mother what is this small-minded fellow he is small-minded person he is he leaves here and sit and still he is practicing job Oh anniversary look at it he could recognize the God living with him how unfortunate so many days and months and years he pastored just suet near to God he couldn't recognize and he's taking the name of God futile that means he is not his ego is not wiped out the ego is there I am taking the name of God that eyes so big even the card cannot enter into the mind friends this is the thing when the salon business II you are listening to my words and tried to assimilate what is this assimilation said aha Krishna the God himself and he is the goal and he is the means cinema history is the God himself and he's the cool and he's the means and that's why he is telling Oh mother mother Rhea seems now history Martin what a small-minded fellow he is he lives here and still he practices Jaffa with Rosalie now sadhana Krishna told practice of jabba through that you can realize God Madonna we are living with God for so many years even then you could not recognize what is the use of taking the name of God it means your mind is not becoming pure and unless and until the purity comes it is of no you sticking the name of God and what is the purity again this is a very vital question what is the priority egolessness when there is no ego then what remains only God and nothing else so our name only coochie by John John some business a well that little legal standard is killing is removed a free from the ego then you are with God and he says whoever comes here referring to himself will have spiritual consciousness awakened at once my god so any was reading these I was feeling my god so we have come to him but so unfortunate we don't have that hundred percent weight who have come to God and Ernie look at his picture we have seen God unfortunate and all of our inner than the past life we didn't do good work so that hundred percent faith is not coming that ego is not going away from our mind so we still think Oh God will reveal himself and he is telling whoever come here whoever is not Hindu Muslim or these are that we ever we will come here with spiritual consciousness awakened all at once he won't have to bother much about Japan he said by Japan you can do this God and when you come to God Salameh Trishna if you have that clear mind why yoga when you reach to the destination with clothes that man we don't see math please not nestle so like this chopper is an instrument which will take us to car and when you reach the God what we are going to do it at least two instantaneously so that's why he's telling he won't have to bother much about japa so this concern but what is the power of cinema Krishna how we understand that no cinema Krishna he usurps a to show me Vivekananda that you and me are one apparently two bodies but in reality we are one when Shani lubricant explains his philosophy we can take it for granted that it is a philosophy Sri Ramakrishna and what is the philosophy Shami become the same to his disciple sister editor Margaret Noble my philosophy can be seen in two two sentences to make people aware about their divine nature each and every soul is divine to make people aware about their divine nature and to help them to manifest it that's all what is the work that we should do what is the spiritual practice that we should do understanding that each soul is potentially divine and when you see the each soul fills me - I am not excluded I'm included and when I'm there I too am having that same thing is in everything we cannot criticize others we cannot shun others we cannot say no to others may be many of them they can do the Hindus can do put the Ramakrishna lives the followers of Saddam apprecia should not do cannot - if they do they don't belong to surround each knowledge this is very clear so this is telling that Asami becomes telling each soul is divine and we have to help them to manifest it how giving them inspiration giving them the faith that is God go to him pray to him he has done this time in the form of mother and she's so kind-hearted just go and pray whatever you want you are going to get it but we can't say that because we don't have the faith to say that we don't believe in that so that is why when we are here we assure that the spiritual awakening is going to happen just have faith in the presence of God in the form of grants in our business thank you need and genomic them on under ooh phone up Donna compa Drita Bikram way he shall be tada [Music] but he shall we do Tama Ramakrishna she does anima ha Oh Shaun T shanti shanti her deu that sir sri ramakrishna eponymous too
