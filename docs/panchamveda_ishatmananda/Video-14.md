[15. Panchama Veda 15: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-JYQwllhoA)

okay let us begin with that famous in our last discourse we were listening bhagavan siram krishna these six kind of people are considered at graces and without hesitation you can kill him because in those days it was like this but in the present day it is not because now we have the laws we have the police and we have the discipline we have the administration for the general people it is constantly all these watches are there so we need not to but we can understand these are the six type of people and siddha krishna's solution is special he said when you are living in the society you have to live with so many different type of people they will be behaving with you in a different way all of them are not religious people all of them will not appreciate your simplicity your guidelessness and your are the way as a spiritual person behave that that they will never accept so that is why what you have to do you have to show your personality you have to ease you have to show in such a way that if necessary i can also bite you then he is telling don't bite because that is the way we must learn we are here in this temple we are going what for to become spiritual and why we are doing all these things we are listening to the discourses we are reading books we are volunteering coming and helping the assam award donating so all these things we are doing only for one purpose what is that to be spiritual what is the spirituality that we will see again and against iran krishna is telling he is telling that the desire should manage the way we are desiring for the worldly desire what we desire means thinking that this world is permanent this name this fame and all these things that we see all people are jumping on this and obviously from the childhood from our birth we are also growing in this atmosphere in this situation we are also thinking that this is the only correct so that we have to discriminate that we learn from bhagavan krishna very few can understand very few and he's telling you about vanishes all other knowledge vanishes then only my knowledge it comes in the mind of the people when there is no the other way in a very wonderful way we find it in the bhagavad-gita the very first chapter arjuna he is going on giving the argument to sri lanka sorry krishna oh i should not kill this people because killing is seen and if i kill there won't be any people to protect the society then the society will ruin one after another argument he was placing krishna the god was simply listening quietly listening didn't say anything but when the arjuna says so i can't think anything else though he is giving the argument argument but within his mind he himself is not sure of it he is not confident about his own argument and that is the reason he is telling ultimately to lord krishna i bow down to you i am your disciple please help me you tell what i should do now there's no flame they were friends now this time he says i am humble i am sitting at your feet i am dedicating myself to you whatever you will say i will accept because my argument my intellect is not working so that is the reason this worldly and it is a man personality like arjuna is not an ordinary person even then he is not understanding things then he is surrendering so that is the way we have to surrender and when we totally surrender to god god i can't understand what should i do this is the problem now i am trying to survive i am trying to leave i am going to this way can you please help me i am the disciple then only god comes and what happens there is no desire where there is desire their god the rama means god cannot be because you are asking for something else in his very simple way he is telling as long as the child is happy with his dog he is playing with the dog with his playmates so long the mother never comes because he is not asking the child is not asking or praying or craving for mother obviously mother says okay when the child is happy let me do some other work when the child is crying and crying and not asking for anything else some but he's offering him some people offering him come i will take you to your mother no i won't go i'll be here on you and then someone is offering the chocolates or candies you won't accept you only want the mother they in the mother comes other desires are there wishes are there satisfactions are there then why god will come may may be divided into four classes those bound by the fetters and they are called bhakta bomb by the fetters of the world there is the mumuksu the seekers after liberation the muni he is telling who is a as parent of emancipation mukti one who has become aware of bondage then only those who are going to the temple are they all emotional majority are not why because they are not aware of the bondage most of the time they go only to spend some time particularly in the indian scenario the people they're all the time moving the great they're very good travelers and they go to only not to see only those beauties in the nature no they only go to the temples so that is one uniqueness of the indian travelers the tourists major portion even today 1995 of the people they'll be going to different places even the poor people will also go but only to the holy places pilgrimages that they will grow but do they go with that with the desire to be liberated no why because they don't know what is bondage they go with all their family then they will be in a hotel living together discussing together going out together that is the joy in the family and then also they will go to the temple of a pronoun and the elderly people are not bowing themselves or showing their devotion to god but more of the time they are engaged to teach that to their younger hey now our so that way they go that is good but the thing is they will go with the prayer then something else so that is what is not means those who have understood this life is a bondage very few have understood very very few so that is very important then come mukta mukta means liberated in this night or previous life or after life they'll be or they have they are called mukta they are not attached with these worldly things they are mothers the two things we have to keep in mind attraction of these worldly things and worldly things means what those things which are changing constantly but that is called worldly things our shujit rasheen the bengali famous actress she never comes out i don't know she must be leaving nowadays she's still alive she won't never come so why because she was most beautiful in those days in her time now if she comes out if i present the picture is published then people's that dream that will break that's why and that's of course she is doing a lot of tapasha she has taken initiation from ramakrishna nation and leave all alone and living alone is not so easy so she is doing puja she's taking doing job all these wishes but main purpose not to show our present day so that people will constantly remember suchitra as that youthful beautiful lady so things are changing obviously so this when we are thinking why should i be so much interested for those things which will never remain so that is the one thing we must have to keep in mind and when that is hundred percent in our mind and naturally where the mind will go only two things are there either god or the world if it is not to the world then it will go to god and when it goes to god and not to the world it becomes liberated liberation from what liberation from bondage what is the bondage this ignorance that this world which is multivarious things attractive things are not attracting me and that is the way we live and another group is there just called nick there their neighbor in this bondage this nitta people they only come for to help us they come they take the human life human birth and then you mix in with us as if they are just like us but their way of leaving way of uh talking way of working is so different then people who look at them and say how they can do it when i cannot and this thing in a wonderful way they have given the description in the uh one bird just trying to eat fruit and it was speaking over here oh it's bitter it's going over there going out this is sweet like that it is hopping jumping flying and trying to eat engaged busy suddenly when slowly slowly it went to the upper branches that bar looked and saw another part of the same plumage quietly sitting and enjoying the quietness then the lower branch bird started asking how you can be so quiet without searching for food and other birds are there you have to take we have to eat as quickly as possible because other birds will come then we don't get that is the conversation that is the way the story goes that girl it has already realized god brahman so it is not attracted with all the fruits symbolizing fruits means the worldly things name fame so meaning and when you go to somebody's house and so many pictures are hanging whole world is full of pictures pictures with great people and who are those great people politicians they were the president of america then the ministers and the senators the governors but all the government did that i am not thinking they were the presidents they were the governors they were the good i mean one one time very famous people but today no more i am also going to be known and when i am no more then this picture has no value at all for my grandson grandchild but he will do it with this there is no value to him you then open it up back it up and give it someone or may throw it away then what is the fun of having that somehow they reached over there and then they spent so much of money energy to get a picture with that man and now after few years it has no value at all and suppose the opposition party has come in power then immediately he himself is putting it back somewhere otherwise he will be in difficulty you have taken photograph with that that means you are his supporter a child so now it is problem so he's hiding so this way the life goes and this is called bichara and what is mukti they again and again we are telling mokta mukti liberation emancipation what is this mukti yogavarsita it's play explained in a very wonderful way rumpa abastiti when i go back to my own cottage maybe a very humble cottage but i feel i can go to any room i can do anything i can close the tab i can put it on open the tab let the water go it's my house i can do anything but if you go to any other place it's difficult even you are paying very high charges in the famous bottle and if you have kept the light on the water flowing you have not closed the tab and the those house dippers they will come they will close it and look at you right from he has come he doesn't know how to close the tap so like that you always feel oh this is not my place this is not my place so similarly we are always afraid oh this is my life what will happen this body it is decaying what will happen my money is all spending now i am retired whatever money i have kept in the bank and instead of getting the interest and paying taxes what a country so this is the very peculiar condition so obviously constantly thinking what to do what not to do but the moment we are in our own home majority of us we do not understand it because this is the vedic or vedantic viewpoint so who am so that is my real identity when i go back to that identity then i never feel any hesitation to do anything i am free but the devotees they don't think in that way so they say etc etc if i can somehow go to the same plane same place where the god is and if i get a corner of that place if i can live over there only i and my whole life is fulfilled and if i can go near to god if i can be with him for some time like this the devotee is ideal that is also mukti because that devotee forgetting the other things and when if by ignorance when i think that i am happy and unhappy like the bird which was picking the sweet fruit and sometimes sour and sometimes happy sometimes not that is wonderful so that is very peculiar sometimes we are very happy sometimes we are unhappy why because we are pandana and what is that not the clear awareness now bashishka is a drama what is the state of existence that is stable and free from suffering can you please tell me right what is the state of existence free from suffering then buddha also asked this question and to get the answer he left all his kingdom and went out in search of peace but she stays up here see the moksha the liberation it is not on the heaven or in the means neither world or in this world it is not there then where it is when all the desires are as you have given up that is called motion and that is the state of existence the moment all your desire someone asked maas adamani she was a village girl never attended any school but through her spiritual practice she resting this state as the bashist muni the guru of ramachandra speaking when there is no desire in your mind that is the moksha don't try to send the heaven or in neither world or in this world it is not anywhere it is within you someone was asking ma how can i realize god by joker by hannah by practicing meditation your mother told yes by that part if all desire all your desire gone immediately will be able to realize in this moment you will realize god so this way who can be called as mukta that question is coming when the from the mind all desire like all dessert means what see that has been categorized again mostly what we want putra now is the desire the people are dying with the virtue then they say our virginia will continue because she will go to somebody's else house we need a son so for that so many things happening in the world but you will not be there what is your project a few years before you were not there a few years after you won't be there and what is your progeny and what is your bombshell but the people will continuously thinking about that and very seriously they will be and that is the reason for and then say a different type of desire so all those desires we have to give away what is bondage one is asking who is liberated one in whose mind this doubts these questions never rises because always in every moment he sees and feel the paramatma in everything he is the question never comes that other day one american gentleman came i told and he was asking me this question why should i be born why didn't i have to practice this meditation prayer all this unselfish work why should i have to i told the moment you think that you need not to you did not because you are but the moment you are thinking i have to then you are bhakta you have to this is very clear now why that answer you will give when you realize god not before so that he is telling see ramakrishna is telling swami vivekananda highest religion he asked what do you want vivekananda he was a meditative type from right from his birth childhood sometimes i will wake up take little food to keep my body then again i will go down i want to enjoy the samadhi and other gurus would have been so happy but this is a special type of guru he has come with a mission mission to establish dharma religion he rebuked his disciple and said chi fi on you is this the desire why i will teach you much higher than this what is higher than samadhi is there anything higher than samadhi yes much more higher than samadhi is there what is that then he said you can see god by closing your eyes can't you see god by opening your eyes everything that you see is nothing but the manifestation of the same god in so many forms in so many names realize it enjoy that is the highest state people do not understand this so and he himself was enjoying when he was passing in a road suddenly in the particular area he saw that the prostitutes are standing over there and he was so happy the disciples they wanted to close the window of the car the charity the car that he was going horse-drawn car and they wanted to close the window because krishna should not you want to dress yourself like this you want to behave like this very good you're so happy he couldn't see anything bad in those mother in that form who am i to tell mother you should not be in this form how do i know what is good what is bad so this is the wonderful way you cannot criticize anyone because the god is playing in that form is in that form how can i criticize this just like you can imagine that we are watching a drama and we know a person who is actually a very good person but behaving as a reader someone he was behaving as a i mean acting as a villain in a very famous drama and he was torturing the ordinary people kicking them and weeping them and behaving inside but personally he was very good uh i've forgotten that the famous the actor and the stage actor and he was then with dashadar he was there he could not restrain he was so angry he took it as a original and then threw his the shoe to that man then he took that shoe and saluted telling this is the greatest reward that i have got for my acting he was acting in that way ravana he was acting now we are so angry with ravana each and every one we have not seen only heart then also we are so hungry why he has taken mashita and all this generation after generation look at that but he was a devotee he acted in that way so this is the moment we see the whole world somebody is criticizing me somebody is going opposing me and someone is friendly all are acting all around me so i must enjoy those things oh that's good god has come as an enemy god has come as a friend god has come in this form god has come in that form so that is the way this is called mukta jivanamukha and swami vivekananda about him sister nimirita road for him there is no difference between secular and sacred when you come to temple we come with a washed dress and when we can offer a flower to god when you can cook for god when you can burn an insane stick for god when you can chant before god and when he can do some puja with all these things showing then we feel that we are spiritual but when you are going to serve the poor people when you are distributing food when you are in the helping the people in distress that is social work that's not spiritual work is it the wrong conception swami vivekananda he said where you are going to serve god why you are locked up in the temple go out see the god waiting for you to get the puja when you are giving the fruits to that poor person think that you are offering food to god when you are giving the clothings when you are helping in any way think that god is accepting you living god in that form he has come constantly that is telling but some people they cannot behave like that sir he was telling about the these people however they go they only try to show try to show try to show i am somebody i am somebody i am somebody we know that you are somebody but you don't need not to go on beating your own wrong but you want to if you only even something sometimes it happens they are so angry with the gurus i gave one leg ruby donation but the guru is not looking at me only that person who gave 10 dollar is chatting talking with that man i am one luck one hundred thousand dollar i have given but the guru is not talking at me okay i will see it happened which is really happened and with the shadow and he was a rich man he used to give donation and that time you know ramakrishna mission was very poor and he gave a good amount so naturally he was expecting the sardanandaji be always attentive the moment he goes one day used to because the moment you see someone you have to be according to research okay you want this thing to take somebody wants other things okay so for him it is nothing now one day it so happened a group of villagers came and saw gandhiji was talking this he told that same person told to our one of our swamiji that swamiji he went to have dinner with the devotee when he reached the devotee said swamiji can you please come along with me to my neighbor he is bedridden and he when he has heard that you are coming he is begging to me requesting me again and again so that i take you to him he has something to tell to you guys and this gentleman who was in the bed with me said oh swami you have come do you know what happened to me this then he told the story i gave the money and i was feeling that i am a rich man swami shardana who is my guru should give attention to me because i am a rich disciple helping him now one day so happened that he was talking with some villagers ordinary people i entered into that room and i said okay okay you all go out now i have come i have to talk with swamiji i have some work and they got afraid they were going out immediately she became so angry with me dude you go out who are you to tell these people to go out i'm talking with them you go out before those ordinary people he insulted me i felt so much that i thought okay i will teach you a lesson you may be my guru but i will teach you a lesson and from that very moment i was going on rooting how to insert sarva-mandaji all through my life at brooded how to insert how in the meantime sarganji passed away and then afterwards i understood why she behaved like that because i never meditated on my guru never followed his instructions and never thought about my guru also you know before meditation we are supposed to think about our guru etc etc that was totally absent in me he was so kind on me through that he put the hatred for him in my mind and now i could not forgive my guru every moment i can see my gurus before me now i have understood that was his blessings not the insult so the sadhu guru the real honest guru a different way he helps so that was the story i heard from him so this is the we also the bhagavan krishna is telling about the people and then he's describing how these people are after hearing because they are only after last and local and nothing else only lost and look they will be leaving only two percent in a very huge building and huge area they cannot go to this corner to that corner of the area but so happy i am having so much of life only they need one room because both of them are leaving husband divided in the same room all the rooms are closed locked but they need 10 rooms house and they will tell people i have 10 bedrooms and 5 guest rooms and these and that what use nobody comes to me i also don't want so what is the life so this is the way they lean and they think they are really very clever not at all so that's ramakrishna when he was describing then other people got afraid one devotee said is there no help for such a worry person can they also get the blessings of god can they be liberated now they listen to the answer to suramar krishna again those very simple thing is telling what are those certainly there is this is the beauty of the sanatana dharma this is the beauty of the hinduism there is no word like eternal hell nothing like that yeah they made a mistake the moment the mistake will go away immediately again they will get the light so here it says certainly there is but what he has to do what the person should do from time to time should leave in the company of the holy man again also going to salute you to meditate on god so ramakrishna is very clearly telling go to solitude not for fishing angling but to meditate on god and thirdly he says father he is adding one thing practice discrimination and fourth pray to god these are the four things he is telling then what is discrimination what is pichara see we find this type of richard even in some great people like alexander is telling alexander is telling to my father i owe my life but to aristotle the philosopher has to talk i know how to live worthily so this is the discrimination father of course i am grateful to him to my father i love him respect him but the philosopher that is to talk he has taught me how to lead the life birthday so this is called discrimination some people will say no i saw some my mother and my father is my guru that's okay that's good but what about the philosophy no i don't have any philosophy but if they see god in the mother and in the father of course is okay but only not only that it is only emotional then it is not does it that you have to think it's called discrimination sriram krishna also asked to practice the vijara and shankaracharya in his famous can you please give me the answer to my question then he is asking what is bondage again and again you people are talking about the bondage what is bondage how has it come because you say that i am a self and pure self and self cannot be bound then how you say that i am bound where from which has come pratishta sir and how does it continue to exist how one is freed from it what is this who is this supreme cell to you be discriminate between them do please tell me teacher is so happy when somebody is asking this question so obviously the teachers are happy when the the student is going to the teacher and asking about the subject all teachers good teachers they become happy oh you are asking nice question good questions that means he is working on it thinking on it so that is the way one should try to please the teachers they say how to do service to our guru suppose a guru is having 200 disciple if every day all the disciples cook 200 dishes the guru will die the next day and all of them they are forcing now guru must hit from my plate something from my cooking now what guru will happen then guru will be a picture no more in liberty so that is that that is not the seva what is shiva puri prasna this is the beauty you have to ask the guru can you please some people will be coming and asking swamiji i don't know why they always look at me and say are you from nepal of course i think i feel happy to be a nepalese nothing wrong maybe because of some features and someone of course he told swamiji are you from durkheim am i so black and i'm not anyway so like these people they why they're asking i do not know then then someone will be asking the are you bengali why you are asking this question because you are going to the bengali people then you have got the answer this way this only useless the moment we have left the heart and home we have no more connection with our family grace language and all this if any monks say are you so and so he's not a mangator he has to be a monk why because at the time of receiving the sannyasa we burn on those things and before the god before the guru and keeping the fire as a shakti that you are witness that i am burning all these things i have no family i have no relation then again they will put in their name immediately but they cannot understand this there's a mistake so that is the thing a true chance you should know after taking the sannyasa 12 years they should not have any connection with the family so all these things are there whoever comes to them their their family all their family so that's why this is the thing we have to understand this is the way the discrimination should go guru is very happy and then he says he must read that the guru is telling his disciple oh great you're asking this question means you're already elevated from the ordinary level to a higher level and he's so happy done in your seat you are blessed this discrimination he is telling what is there in the body you are all taking care of body the religious i mean rich people if you go to their family i had the fortune or misfortune to go to the very very rich then which you have not seen my god the lavishness unthinkable and what do they do whole day they're only changing their dresses their shoes their makeup their this room their bedroom they're going to and the only profession they are having is going to marketing going to shopping what how many things they need this is unless unless you understand these unthinkable there are so many very beautiful looking girls ladies are there among the very poor people i have seen them they never use any makeup but they are so good looking but unfortunate they are spending all that time so society because of the society and all these things they are not that's ramakrishna is telling what is there in the body nothing just see and look at the body there's nothing actually this hilton hotel we went i thought there is a big hotel and yeah the big only carpets are there big rooms are there if you open a room the same one or two beds are there maybe the cloth that is covered in the bed is very costly but when you sleep you do you remember the on costliest cloth you were sleeping and if you can't sleep then that costly cloth won't help you so what is all this thing so this is not no use actually is telling look at your own body what is there some flesh little blood little bone and what is there for that you'll waste your life this is called richard that's why he's telling practice discrimination then he himself practice to show us in those days very rich people were jaming guards the landlords and they had an outdoor room in it and there is to meet the villagers and their subjects prajas and all different type of people and all people are seating so javinda cannot sit they need to equal if they are that man is sitting i'm also sitting there they pay half life to make a difference that i'm a jaminda i'm a landlord majority of the time they used to sit like this a half life and that is painful how long do you sit like that and then then you have to change the side also and all people in those days it was the habit of smoking hubble bubble we have seen that so that's but juminda also is also practicing he is also smoking but if you smoke from the ordinary hubble bubble he is equal to what he will do he will smoke of course the same thing but from a silver bubble and the long road will be there he'll be uh smoking like this and sriram krishna observed it and he thought if it is so nice why don't you i try it so he told his disciple himself was a very rich man he was having all this thing everything was arranged then krishna he from the right hand side he was showing and then taking the path and it was so difficult because he cannot pop also properly then from the left he was lying on the back he was lying on his belly then he got up and said mine this is called smoking from silver not at all good then he said to that disciple so this is if you are seeing that you are very happy not at all when sometimes you look at the couple they are so happy they are one is actor and actress both of them so prominent so famous thousands people are there cheering shouting and next day they are divorced the thing is when we see is all fruitless useless so that is called discrimination through discrimination mind becomes detached from the temporary things and easily get attached with god why they have said discrimination why they are asking to discriminate because mind is very peculiar it cannot remain only all alone always wants some companion if you are giving the company of the world it is in the company of the world and if there is no company from the world side then it will go automatically to god the obvious that's why if you are discriminating and would withdrawing the mind from these worldly things whether is awareness swamiji said what is there the moment you are withdrawing automatically it will go to god and when it goes to god you get everything that is sure what do you want name fame appreciation protection prosperity anything and everything will come if you only go to god that's why swami vivekananda is telling unselfishness is more pain unselfishness means detached mind moment we are thinking about this and that it is attached and when we are detaching from that it is unselfish i and mine this thought is absent so unselfishness is more pain it will give you much more but we don't have the patience to practice it unfortunately we don't have the patience to practice it so how to discriminate bhagavat it teaches this is a very simple sanskrit server name even a moment of our life is more valuable than all the jewels we should not waste it that is telling is the killing companion holy man going to solitude then practice discrimination then the fourth is telling pray to god and now the time is up we cannot next day we will try to explain prayer this is wonderful in the prayer three types of prayer is there first is begging second is asking and third is praying so all the same you are asking something in the prayer also you are asking when you are begging you are asking and you when you are asking obviously the same thing but it has a difference why psychologically but the beggar is all the time thinking i have no right to ask so constantly with folded hand he is asking so a few people came from the shift community and they were constantly thanking the god oh god he was so kind you have given us these you have given us that sriram krishna he himself god he said why you are talking like that god has given you the life he who has given you the life is your creator he's your father and no son have to give constantly thank you thank you to god or please please to god when i were coming preparing to come to america some of our brother monks they told me they also never visited america from somewhere they got that they told in america and in europe he must be very courteous so two things you must learn always say please before you say anything and say thanks after saying anything so i always say please and thanks and yesterday our volunteer was telling for everything you were telling thanks and so that so this is the way the life so here we need to thank all the time to god eve we think he's our father so yes we have every right to my father's property so here this is and then in the prayer there is circular prayer spiritually so about prayer the details of prayer and the most importance in christianity they have given prayer right from jesus and all his apostles and other saints they have talked about the prayer in islam prayer buddhism prayer hinduism prayer and what is this prayer most easiest way to realize god so that we will discuss in our next day but if you have any question please ask a little bit a little time is there other two very important topic we will discuss in our next class i think in the next month now this month will be over in the next month in august there will have the two very important topic we'll discuss one is vishwas of faith another is prayer as ramakrishna is telling have faith and then do prayer so we'll discuss about it if you have any questions but this weekend in the friday saturday sunday we'll go to ganges we'll be having a retreat on how to be spiritual it's also very important in our life how to be spiritual but that is the goal of that only we are coming so that how to be spiritual that we discuss over there for i think mainly two days because the friday at about eight to nine in the evening there's the introduction then the whole day saturday and sunday also morning two hours or three hours so after the lunch you come back it's a beautiful atmosphere and that is a real place for us discussing about spirituality is our gang is entered then i will come back the sunday i won't be able to give the talk over here uh maharaja will give the talk here uh tuesday will be here of course so any question or otherwise we just have a pronoun to tapu sirama krishna and conclude a krishna foreign
