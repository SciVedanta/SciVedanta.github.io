vacation and now we are meeting the first time for this bunch of aveda many people they were asking show me what happened to the Pancham aveda I told Pancham aveda is there we are also there but it is very cold in between us punjabi then so let it the it go so almost it is all right now we once again start this wonderful Pancham of Ada and the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna discourses usually we read from the Gospel of cinema Krishna which is translated by Xiaomi nickel ananda g from the original bengali kaatham rita and discuss the words the burger van see Ramakrishna in the light of different scriptures now we will stop start again before that as usual we will let us turn to this mantra and then we will do tabu kaatham rhythm dr. G venom Kobe be really calm calm Asha bahama sravana mangalam srimad athim boovie green aunty a burrito Jana even those who are hearing it and they are also getting the benefit of the spiritual development and the dishwasher and we know those who are continuously following this I think this is the 94th the day we are studying this and in the meantime all every 25 lectures have coming up CDs three cds are there now when you complete up to hundred and the city will come like this and people are liking it why because the very simple way the teachings of the spirituality when you read moreabout gita when you read pancetta she when you read Upanishads okay there are words are there but the way see Rama Krishna is telling and so close to us and so simple as if as if so simple so it is very very attractive and we stopped for winter vacation and 17th in a member 2015 and now this the after reading the comment by Sri Ramakrishna no matter what path you follow Yoga is impossible unless the mind becomes tranquil see these are the very simple words the mind of a yogi is under his control he is not on under the control of his mind in the page number 248 the gospel of sri ramakrishna by Xiaomi nikhil ananda gee this lines are there no matter what path you follow the three words we can notice in these two lines the path now it says Yoga is impossible and then the control of the mind the three words we know the Sanatana Dharma are the Hindu religion researching through the ages has discovered forth different paths that this is very very important according to the condition of the mind according to the aptitudes they have given the four paths not suddenly it cannot come like that they have observed the people why he is not able to realize God why he is not interested in God why can't he sit for meditation all these things years together they observe the research and they understood there are four different types of mentality and accordingly human mind is a part of which is a human part of human personality where thoughts are flowing constantly as you called in Sanskrit chitta vritti with the means constant the thoughts and it is going on on and on now if we compare it like a flow of water very clear flow of water now suddenly someone put some red color in it water is flowing but we observe that rate color water is flowing and then someone afterwards put the black in it it becomes again the black and if you mix the white same water flowing it becomes white 2 similarly our mind thoughts are flowing and these thoughts when it is coming in contact with the tremendous activity it becomes Roger when it is tranquil it becomes Satwa and it is color is white and when it is in slumber and criticizing others trying to make some difficulties for the others is a black there's also the thoughts we only observe the actions of course but before the action there is a thought and naturally that this way it goes like this so we all know the thoughts changes observing the changed as the Rishi's the spiritual researchers they found four different type of people what discriminative they will be constantly asking why this why that why not these why not that so they are going on discriminating and the devotees the highest form the highest goal to reach God and to reside in the place that is heaven now the discriminative person he will say okay suppose you go you are not alone there will be many other people also and you find that the God is talking with someone or giving somebody something immediately you will feel jealous oh my god why he is not giving to me that you have gone to God near God in the oven but are you at peace there may be like this is that is called this cumulative type of people unless and until you are one then always there is possibly to possibility to have the conflicts that is called discrimination and these people they will be discriminating constantly apparently when they are talking you will feel oh they're atheists they do not believe in the existence of God now they believe but their approach is by understanding each and every step thoroughly and then after reaching over there what is going to happen there is also somebody told if you are doing this thing you will go to heaven and immediately the emotional type of people they will accept that SS that is alright we will go to heaven where is heaven what is heaven what will happen in that place how long we are going to be there in the heaven is it for the permanent or the temporary stay the emotional people do not think in that way but the discriminative people they're always judging this way so the discrimination is a path and that is called guiana and second is an active type of people they do not have that type of dis community faculty didn't bother about that they do not have devotion or emotion but they have a wonderful feeling to help others so that is utilizing that rishis they are utilizing that type of mentality also very very active and if you ask them to sit for meditation it is impossible for them then how we can help them or guide them to realize God just because they are very much active one day realize God the sometimes this children they are hyperactive then the special type of researches they are doing how to give you education even though he is hyperactive when he goes to the school with the other children we call it normal and is hyperactive he conceit in one place constantly thinking in different so do you think we will simply put aside and say no education is not for him no the society is thinking the circus is going on why he is hyperactive what type of medicine you should give what type of dealing out a way to approach so similarly in the spiritual life also that those who are very very active so they are telling observing what type of actions they do as because they had that activity if you channelize that for the good it is good if you are not then destructive now the flow of water is coming if you channelize you can produce electricity and the flow of water if you are not generalizing it will destroy the whole thing wherever it will go so the power is there we have to channelize so it was channelized that's called karma yoga and then it said okay you need not to go to Temple you need not to meditate you need not to practice on the other way but whatever you are doing when you are helping a person is very good we appreciate but do it without any expectation that's all everything that you do for the others doing you must do for the betterment for the good for the helping with others but without any expectation and that will help you to realize God that is called Karma Yoga the onc ramakrishna mentioned that path it means this four paths then comes the emotional way of type of people they feel oh my god can take cook something for the god and the clot of emotion is the I should cook I should decorate I should do these I should do that there is the emotional part when you say what type of is God is going to eat your food they'll be hard no no no i am going to cook an offer I'm sure God you later so naturally this is the type of people that emotion is there that also utilized for the development of the spiritual life and they call it of T the bhakti marga Marga means the path web de means devotion it is an emotional way of understanding God or trying to realize God or trying to reach God so this is and then another type of people are there who don't like to talk don't like to work who don't like say they are tranquil so they are you okey when see Ramakrishna is mentioning yoga is impossible easy mentioning only that particular path of yoga no so when you read the gospel of serum Krishna we need to explain this because most of the people many of the people they may may misunderstand days because they will think it is a yoga yoga is a one of the path then why he is telling any path you take no matter what path to take then who is he mention about the yoga is not only one here the yoga means Union when he is speaking about the yoga here in this particular line it means union union with God union with artman union with Brahman union with the super whatever the consciousness or whatever way you express the dat is so one is when he mentions about the path for paths and it is the uniqueness of the Sanatana Dharma Hindu Dharma it is not forcing all to go in a one channel whether you like it or not you have to know there are four different and that beyond this there is nothing why because the human temperament human mentality human thinking capacity is just like this this is only for one is discriminative another is contemplative another emotional devotional and another is very very active so these four paths so when see Ramakrishna is mentioning whatever path you follow that is that means any path all the four path is mentioning any stealing yoga is impossible the yoga means union with your gold now again if you say the discriminative type of people what is your goal he will say Brahma brom one is my goal the Brahman is that is the all-pervading consciousness so that is his goal the Brahman then if you ask the emotional people the devotion devotees what is your goal God and then if you ask the tranquil and Yogi's what is your goal he was a Paramatma and the active God and in whatever he thinks the same we can go now this is the uniqueness different names have been given and understanding is also different but bhagavati Ramakrishna said you are reaching to the same place but of course degree is a different understanding capacity is a different if we think the God is only having the four hands and he is having a chakra sudarshan chakra in his finger and he is like these what is your God then after that slowly slowly he will understand my this God is in everything everywhere so when the God is everywhere ere he cannot have a particular image body so naturally his consciousness everywhere the swami vivekananda said we never travel from falls to the truth but lower truth too high a truth what is the lower truth is my god he only takes food from me and he is having only these his faces these his color is this he wears this type of clothes and all these things correct but the Lord truth the same thing seeing God everywhere then ultimately it comes to the living gods were the living gods the beings each and every being is nothing but the living gods and goddesses but the manifestation of the same God same manifestation of the divinity is in the human being so Swami Vivekananda said yes everything is nothing but the manifestation of the God but the best manifestation is the human being the taj mahal na Jamal is one of the wonderful place in India and almost all over the world people know about it is a wonder one of the seven wonders of course now the wonders least have increased this is the Taj Mahal Taj Mahal means that wonderful place the moving Tabernacle the Jews that temple is called tabernacle the moving tyrannical moving temples who give this human being among the human beings those who are unselfish those who are helping others those who are constantly trying to be high practicing I moral values they are naturally above the other human beings so the degrees of manifestations different manifestation so here they always say ramakrishna is tailing yes yoga the union with God now what is the purpose of spiritual life to understand this and nothing else what is spiritual life now some people who are beginning the spiritual life they are thinking I will be protected by god I will have all my prayers and wishes fulfilled and some supernatural power I will have all these things are there and when I am complete this in this life when I go to the other lives that is called there in the heaven I should be with God and enjoying again the company of God etcetera now if it is so then again the question comes is it permanent so he is the person who is thinking in this way his thought is having some defense sorry then naturally we have to understand this and then it comes in this way the union with the goal and when you go to the goal finally it comes then here afterwards when see Rama Krishna is tailing the control of the mind first he said in one line only only simple one-line he said whatever path you follow how many paths for paths why the four parts because of the different implements why the different implements we are coming to this point why the people are having different eight of temperaments now he used the word yoga it is one of the name of one of the path now here he mentioned union with the supreme goal and third he said control of the mind Yoga is impossible unless the mind becomes quite the mind of a yogi is under his control and what does it mean now if we elaborate then we will find that mind is what is this the constant cheetah breath team what is mind flow of thoughts and what is thought impressions of the experiences collected through our five senses sense organs and in the past lives and also in the present life so when you say the mind what is the mind mind is nothing but the flow of thoughts we're from the thoughts come that is very important the thought is coming from our experiences and how the experiences we collect only by coming in contact with the objects of this world through our senses and what are those senses again the Rishi's they are very particular about giving this and they are telling the five different senses this is the uniqueness in the Hinduism now if we go on telling many other things this is not rational or scientific but when you pinpoint and say why these very rational and at the same time scientific and that is why slowly slowly the Vedanta in the name of Vedanta the Hinduism is getting the acceptance all over the world thoughtful people they are thinking understanding and then accepting it is not true that some people are going and telling if you accept our thoughts i will give you these and that no no temptations and when he is the difficulty then i am going and telling him if you accept my tart are and my religion then I will help you it's not like that DC is the uniqueness of Hinduism and this is permanent why because based on the truth based on the realization based on the discrimination based on the researchers thesis and what are the thoughts human personality is nothing but the thoughts some people are thinking that I should go and break those things destroy those things why is thinking like that it's not just he's a mad and thinking now he has his philosophy but the wrong type of thinking the destructive thinking why destructed thinking because ignorance whenever one gentleman came here he was telling us to pass through this road as to wonder who are the people living over here and today when I saw the all are welcome then I thought will I can go I came and then I have in and I am thinking is a very good place so see the wind he is passing through the nearby places and looking at us man not understanding about us not meeting us not knowing us the doubts are there who are these people what they are doing now when he comes when he sees the library the books meeting the Swami's talking with them meeting with the devotees talking with them seeing all these things then he get convinced so understanding comes when we come to know each other knowledge when we know each other then you understand though languages different features are different cultures are different but we are all one so that is called the thoughts the thought comes through the experiences to the knowledge and knowledge comes as a gentleman came he saw he heard he touched he felt everything then he was convinced so our puncher indriya we call in Sanskrit puncha means five indriyas senses sense organs the gun in the rear they call it gianna india karma india and gianna in there what is the guiana inria gianna means knowledge and these injuries these senses sense organs it collects the different type of information from again there is a fight list there is some object it has a smell it is a touch it has a site and all these things we go our eyes go collect about its feature comes back and gives the information it looks like this then the nose smells like this then the hand it goes and touches it is touch like this feeling is like this so this way we hear about it that is also so Chuck soo karna na shika juba and talk sometimes some of the people they will taste something after cooking they will taste what is that knowledge what that knowledge true test he will understand whether it tastes like this or not whatever he was cooking or she was cooking so all these things organs are constantly collecting information where it is going to the mind only when the mind is accepting it immediately is not reacting either immediately reaction or sending back in the store and keeping it over there and it is all there in our philosophy why because the researches it goes into the mind and the total we call untuk karana and these is very very important what is there in the store if all the bad things are there then it will be very difficult all the junk we have to remove we have to clean and then we have to reset the whole store then only it is possible to realize God now when you are talking about God thinking about God we should have a very clear idea about the god now when we are talking about removing or cleaning all the garbages from our store which is called untuk corona which is called the mind which we accumulated when we were children we used to go and collect so many other things the pebbles these and that going on collecting collecting collecting and then when we grow up we simply leave it like that and come away sometimes our mothers there is to keep all those things as a memory of the child but so it has no value so shall we keep all the memories full with those things which are not of use no we have to change it how to eradicate these impressions what are those things impressions they see i am not talking about the somebody told some time and we have to follow not like that i'm talking that way we had to have the approaches to our goals and this is how to eradicate how to remove all the trashers from the store from our mind so that the new thoughts can come and the majority of the new thoughts positive thoughts will be there in our mind then only our whole personality will change we go to Saddam kushina back to him why to him because he has realized God and he is very recent only in the very modern times he was here 1836 to 1886 and we will be celebrating is TT puja we call it TT puja and though it is exactly on the 10th but as because it is a working day we have taken itself because devotees won't be able to come on that day so the celebration will be pooja will be on saturday the 12th of this month every time what we are going to think on that the doing said that they giving respect to him remembering him trying to understand him why that is beneficial for our own spiritual life and how he is helping us giving us our teachings we're from his giving these teachings from his own realizations he is realized it and then he is telling if you follow in this way then only it is possible what is that fast he said Sardu sangha sangha means the company sado means the Holy only company if you go to a holy company and what is that holy company the moment we think about a company though we use the word company as if another person and we are going near to that person now it may be of course we are going to that person through thoughts to a good book we are getting a very holy company by reading this gospel of Sri Ramakrishna what is that holy company because constant the thoughts are on God on unselfishness on the spirit on the Bremen so naturally beyond this body consciousness and the mind and the spirit it goes upwards and body drags us down word and the body is necessary but inside the body their spirit and that it is easy to understand through the mind and so we have to give most importance in the mind and this mind means first is sadhu sanga listen to a holy person read the holy books and immediately you get the wonderful impressions but understanding should be very very clear the misinterpretation may give even the holiest of the holy book if you misinterpret then it is very very wrong sometimes jokingly I don't know seriously no people is got talking like that see Ramakrishna said this world with all its wealth is nothing like the dust so taka Marty in his own words the well that you see is nothing bird the dust the art of this is futile useless some people real estate business they are doing they told see Ramakrishna was correct if you have a lot of property the here there's land now you can sell it in a great value and you will be rich so it is a wrong way of interpretation maybe jokingly but the thing is if you misinterpret the teachings you go nowhere so seducing they won't do only on that do when you listen to these good words inspiring words spiritual words the next is he says you have audit now you go and ponder over it think over it meditate over it sony regional bars so he says go to a solitude and go on thinking meditating trying to find out the real meaning of these teachings this is very important we go we'll listen we have understand or misunderstand we go back and then accordingly we think the show me told like this or the book told like that you have to understand this very clearly that is why those stories we find that the two brothers are approaching to the god their father and said father teachers and the father says thou are that you are that supreme then the the younger brother he came and he saw his reflection and he said My father the God he said I am dad that means this body see you means what being here so he understood that same teaching as the body and then he became a surah because his understanding was wrong why wrong his elder brother the same teaching he started thinking how I can be the same God because this body cannot be the God because it is changing someday it will die whatever it may be today or after hundred years is going to die how can that be the god with permanent without any changes see the discrimination the sadhu sanga is good we hear a very good word then our discrimination is very very important and all the wrong things that we see is happening everybody in all religion they are telling the very good wonderful spiritual teachings interpretation understanding that we have to if the interpretation of the very good word is wrong its of no use rather is wrong use if they say the God told these and I have to do these and see the issue that all the stories of the Asura in our might ologies because of the wrong understanding of the same thought so they gave the all importance of the body and they wanted to keep this which is / 10 / airy they can never make it permanent so obviously this is very important when we go to see Ramakrishna how you will teach yourself to eradicate to clean up all our mind and then control it then if I say go to a holy person listen to the holy words immediately the next he said go to a solitude seat over there all alone and go on pondering over that thought the moment we anyone if we go on pondering over any particular thought clarity will surely come and then again if you go to the holy person and asking him you told this and I was thinking and this is my conclusion am I correct again you will say I think you should do in a different way same thing we hear in the Punishers when a young boy is coming a bra mature is coming and asking please tell me what is Brahman then he said onion brahmadevaya not go so this is bremen go and ponder over it he goes back he meditates he comes back he said okay then what is your thought what do you think Seiryu this is ok on numb but the food is only sustaining this body how can it be permanent yes your your thought is going in the right direction go again and meditate and it's not one or two days 12 years when many did on that field where's and again and again and again like this when you are reading the usual Vader we read many of you have you get there in the class 48 years they were practicing this and the girl she practiced 24 years and then she said to that gentleman now you have finished and you know what is Veda what is the truth now let us start a householders life let us marry settle down raise the family and then in the same girl is telling afterwards please tell me so that after completion of all these things I can realize God why she is telling this because she understood the Dharma she knew that all these things that I am doing temporary so i have to go to God and when I am reaching to God only knowledge can help me the permanent knowledge so first is sadhu sanga then the varmint that concentration on that particular same teaching coming out with the actual original meaning of it understanding it then SWA Dharma when I have understood these like the girl of the yajurveda she understood that I cannot become a monk right this moment so she gave the proposal to a young man and you have studied these you are also understanding the beta properly will you marry me let us settle so shwarma what is the SWA dharma that is a degree st so the slow dharma is also very very important the first sadhu sanga then knee region bars going to a solitude then whatever the responsibilities that I accept let me do it perfectly SWA Dharma pollen in the bhagavad-gita also secretion is telling is better to die in your own duty so other may need onam seria para darme abaya baja now that is very very important in the swath irma the responsibilities that I have accepted I must try to do perfectly in that I should not change the whole thing I am accepted responsibility and for my decision from for my activity this whole society is depending and then I change suddenly now you should not do that sosua Dharma is very important Sosa Ramakrishna said SWA Dharma pollen again do your duties but fixing your mind on god that is very important do your duties but fixing your mind on god so this is called SWA dharma pollen then he said bichara discriminate and developed the spirit of renunciation these are the teachings of sri ramakrishna and apart from these no other things are there to help us to realize God and if we think that we will go on reading the Veda or the Bible or the Tripitaka or these and that we can go do that but you have to take out the gist out of that and you have to practice it apply those things in your own behavior and how you can do it so the simplest way he has given the seven points fast is the holy company second is pondering over that particular thought in a very secluded place where nothing is going to disturb you not the telephone not the company of a frame not the newspaper nothing so simply day after day you ponder with that and then you come out understanding it properly and perform your duties according to your test suppose you think that I like to renounce the whole world and become a monk you're welcome after hearing this if you think know enough I am NOT going to become a household or accepting any responsibility I like to become a monk or a nun I like to renounce I don't want anything name free money nothing I only want God and for that 24 hours my mind should be there and for that whatever responsibility will be given I will and nowadays some people of course are there individually they are practicing but most of the time there is a organization they get the umbrella of an organization they get all this benefits they need not to think about their the minimum provisions that are necessary for the life the food clothing shelter the gate and in exchange they do some perform some of the duties and then they are free to concentrate to practice spirituality that is the organizational help the gate so this is called sadhu sanga then neogen boss and then comes wah Dharma when I am practicing SWA Dharma my own duty Sri Ramakrishna stealing perform it keeping your mind on god but every moment I have to judge myself that is called bichara discrimination whatever I am doing am i doing for God are doing for something else who is going to tell you in this country particularly very very difficult even if you know you cannot go and tell it even the parents are also hesitant to tell the children don't do this do this now so they are free you have to tell them in a different way so it depends on the particular person constantly used to think or she has to think my purpose to go to this society with anthesis iety to occur the spiritual benefit a mind getting the spiritual benefit that is the thing the one elderly lady she comes this he cleans these carpets every week she comes then clean all these things then she goes now suppose she is thinking suppose he is not suppose she is thinking i am doing doing it so that the insurer choix me will be in a good relation with me etcetera etcetera is wrong now I won't be able to understand his attitude he has to or she has to understand this so this is called bichara which other doesn't mean that constantly updating obrim mazurka jagan mithya etc not like that every step I have to think like this I am doing in this way is it good so the devotion should be there the bechari should be there otherwise you cannot make the progress again let me repeat first is the company of a holy person second leaving in the solitude and pondering over the teachings then applying those teachings in our daily life SWA dharma then discrimination every moment whatever I am doing is it all right sometimes I have to shout sometimes I have to show show my ego my personality it is necessary also and if they won't know because god no that is wrong because sometimes you need to show like that because ceramic ISNA is telling you should hiss but don't bite oh he ssing means that particular moment it was necessary otherwise you may be that you were in difficulty so so to stop the bad type of people so bechari then comes practice regular practice it's called a parson ah poop amines near asana sitting constantly I am sitting near near to whom by the god of the ideology or my goal how it is possible practicing practice constantly and in a disciplined way practicing of discipline what is that barsana get up early in the morning wash yourself go to Temple sit for meditation do the jabber if you don't do it then you will never or today I have done so after seven days again I will do is ok but if you realize God if you like to realize God you have to have a discipline life otherwise you won't be able to do it so the portion of the practice of discipline that has been given to you taught by your guru the preceptors the guide spiritual guide that you have to follow it regularly but all these things are possible it's all the teachings of sri ramakrishna he said barsana and all these things are possible if you have the complete faith so the basis is the faith faith is vishwas the vicious of the faith God is there and as the chaitanya mahaprabhu as the Shankar Acharya as the Buddha as the cries as a ceramic ISNA vivekananda if all they could realize god I can also realize God see every day you have to have developed that faith I can realize God and to that that particularly for that you have to go on giving the suggestion to yourself and that is called prarthana so the seven points first is holy company sadhu sanga then knee region bars and that is called living in the solitude third performing your own responsibilities with the keeping the mind at the feet of God SWA Dharma then discrimination whether i am following practicing the religion regularly and pract in a proper way then barsana is all discipline that i am following in my life and then vishwas ax there is a faith have firm faith I am divine and to manifest that divinity begging the blessings of God that is called prarthana Oh God you have saved when the father is holding the hand of a child there is no fear for the child so please hold my hand as because you are my father you're my mother you're my only one whom I can rely on so please hold my hand so when I am going on praying like this then only slowly slowly my mind is becoming clarified so that is the only way the frames these are the seven steps one after another suggested by this vagabond see Ramakrishna because he was God himself he not only realized like any ordinary st. osage's he was the God Himself all these things within him like the Sri Krishna was giving all the teachings not that he realized it after practicing it was within him it is coming out from him only similarly these thoughts coming out from the person see Rama Krishna who is nothing but God himself so that bish wassa the fate if we have then we must listen to him and then we should try to practice it whatever little as possible sulfa moppy ostia dharmasya try a te mahato biod again in the bhagavad-gita even if we're trying a little of this even that will give you a lot of spiritual benefit sulfa moppy a little cell phone smell little appeal that means if a siddur must hear this religion what is that religion this teaching what is the teaching these are the teachings trai they will give you the benefit motto by art from the great fear what is a great fear I am going to die nothing is going to happen to me all this fear will go away and tranquility peace joy will come in my mind so this is the simplest way but perfectly when it treating way see ramakrishna lavon's Ramakrishna is giving us this directions and this is called knowledge and that is why I have given the name the fifth knowledge Pancham aveda the gospel of ceramic ISNA that is Cathar it let us offer our pranaam and then we will conclude next friday Shami burden on the G will give the class again please come and it will continue every tuesday friday sunday the regular routine will go on and in seventh that is monday this hour shivratri puja is the today is the fast seventh mahashivratri there is a unique opportunity you know the one after another all these things come again and again if you cannot do it regularly at least occasionally that the most of the people they will fast and then in the evening they will come they will join in that they'll be going on repeating the shiva nama which gives the mind a very tranquil and pure at atmosphere and the mind becomes very much purified by that and then we are offering all the ablations to the lord shiva and get after taking Prashad going back so the whole day we can spend in that way and the weekend the saturday 12 again we will meet here from morning eleven o'clock for ceramic is no TT puja so laters offer our pranaam to bhagawan sri ramakrishna with this
