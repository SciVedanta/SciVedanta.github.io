[391. “Let the Ego be your Servant” - Panchama Veda ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKGu0yK-Jvs)

messed up namaskar they are devotees and Friends we will study the gospel of srirama Krishna the panchama Veda let us begin with the stotra jivanam angalam SRI Mada Tatam bhubanaha the nectar of thy seen effacing utterances bring life and hope to those scorched by the misery now and then in this class we have discussed that these words of bhagavan sudama Krishna it is meant for those who have understood the futility of this worldly life those who are enjoying it is not for them let them continue when they will understand that this is all this thing that we see is so temporary so futile so then they will understand the meaning of the words mentioning they are extrolled by the wise sages and mayor listening to them should bestow auspiciousness on all they confer very prosperity those who spread them broadcast are verily magnanimous they distribute what is completely satisfying to the hearers the this way the meaning of this the sloka those who are reading they are also blessed those who are listening they are also blessed but blessed means what blessed means when they are understanding the meaning of the world now friends we were discussing about the discourses that bhagavan SI ramakrishna is having with the devotees in Ramadan Ram's house his house in Calcutta this moment he was saying I said to keshav since the ego cannot be given up Let it remain as the servant no up to this what is ego it is associated with our this person now many times we have discussed that what is this ego we don't know actually but we always put the finger on our body on our chest and we say that this is this I I is this body that we meant how can that be so I was wondering when we were small little babies some people have taken photograph and without mentioning if they show that baby picture to us and say can you recognize who is this we will wonder we won't be able to so we cannot recognize our own body which was in a baby form on the lap of a mother then somebody will say it is you this is your mother then only a whole year says this is my mother this is me so when I say this body isn't that is a funny that even I was not knowing how I was this body was when I was a baby so obviously that those who are thinking that it is possible that ego this these body this is futile this is useless second is this the mind when I say I do I say that this is the mind or my thought one intellect there is also changing so when I say I that I or the intellect or the buddhi after a few years that changes then what is that I so this is called Maya it is there it is very much present and for the ego there are so many clashes so many suffering so many problems in the simple households the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law they are fighting because of the ego Two Brothers are fighting because of the ego two nations are fighting because of the ego of the two leaders but we don't know what is this ego but that is called Maya in vedanta we are doing we are cutting the throat of each other and we do not know why we are doing it so if we understand this much then we have to go beyond this ego to know the truth and Truth is all pervading Consciousness and full of love and full of joy and full of peace how it is possible because the ego is standing in between the truth and me the ego is standing like a bulldog and the moment I am trying to go towards real me and this ego my own bulldog is trying to bite me trying to kill me the bhagavan cinema Krishna is giving and wonderful technique he said I say to keshav since the ego cannot be given up I cannot give the ego if I give up the EGO then where I stand and I have to go beyond the ego so this is the called sadhana This is called spiritual practice the first I have to understand actually what I should do second how I should do third if I am successful for doing it crossing over the ego scaling over the ego then where I am going to land what I am going to get if these are all clear then the spiritual life become really fruitful otherwise some people they just think oh it is peace it is all and they will be looking at the sky it is peace ah and in a very humble and simple place they will be there so that is okay if they like it is okay but unless and until you are mixing with the people how your ego you will understand there is no clashes they won't understand the ego and you are just superimposing hypnotizing yourself thinking I am a spiritual person because I am looking at the sky at the whole beautiful birds flying and all that all the emotion is good but what is spiritual life it is understanding and then behaving accordingly that is the real spiritual life the spiritual life we we don't give up everything we are in the battlefield that's why exactly what SRI Krishna told to Arjuna mom anusa that is spirituality when I give up everything no challenges no opposition nothing is there I am in a place quietly sitting and I am not talking with anyone or eating little and then looking at the open bar space I am peaceful that is a retired life that is nothing wrong but then afterwards what can you really talk to people mix with them understand them and even if there is a differences you can adjust with that statistical spiritual life that is why bhagavan SI ramakrishna when Swami Vivekananda said I like to go in meditation and in samadhi forgetting everything of this world and only I will get up to eat something to keep up this body without the body where the mind will be and then again I will go into deep samadhi sidama Krishna said why on you that is ramakrishna the eunuch others say oh so good he is meditating so immigration said fire on you you are a hero other people should come to you and you should solve their problems you should see that how to develop this whole world the misery The Suffering The Tears that should go away how understanding the reality the real nature of the being that is heroic life in spirituality not taking the sword and cutting the heads that is not the hero different type of thing but the spiritual heroism is understanding the truth and then overcoming Conquering the ego and then you become friend of all the religious life is excellent is not just somehow hiding your head somewhere and not looking at the problems of the world and you are thinking oh a world is so peaceful no not like that not like the ostriches they put their head into the sand and they are thinking everything is okay not like that the sudama Krishna is now teaching us through keshav how to handle the terrible the force the power that has separated us from our real original identity that ego how to handle that then he is mentioning since the ego cannot be given up let it remain as a servant it must be humble you know in the bhakti tradition in the path of the devotion they always say there are five approaches five type of temperaments to get attached with the god somehow you have to go to God and what are the temperaments the five different type of approaches we can they have mentioned and the bhakti scripture this is Shanta Shanta means peaceful indifferent now after understanding the futility of this world first and realizing that everything goes according to the will of God then the rishis they became calm and peaceful not that just behaving peaceful acting peaceful no not that most of the time we see the people they are behaving half closed eyes and sitting they look so good or they are so peaceful but in fact no we can understand them when they are talking with people mixing with people facing the challenges can they truly have that quality then only otherwise immediately the ego a hissing up hey you should not talk to me like this you should not behave like this so that is the test the Shanta means they have already realized and after the realization of the truth and what is the truth everything is happening because of the will of God because this is the Divine Play and Sanskrit is called Leela the Divine plain God has become this world and God is giving somebody happiness somebody is suffering these this everything after the realization they will quietly seat and observe what is happening as we go and watch the movie and we know that whatever is happening is all everything all just in camera it's not real some of the things they try to depict from the reality but mostly at that moment in the movie we see that little boy all alone on the sea beach there is no one to feed him and we feel actually so many cameras and Crews and people all up there so they are taking the photo so when you understand that oh that's true that little boy on the sea beach is not alone there are so many people only movie is going on you become peaceful isn't it so similarly those who have already understood that everything that is going on nothing but the movie they become peaceful the Shanta in Sanskrit Shanta means peaceful or indifferent bhagavan SI ramakrishna said the Rishi is attitude there were realized Souls then come Dasia this is servant's attitude he's also a realist soul but at the same time he thinks as because the nature is provoking me to work act let me be humble and what is this nature God's power now the God is asking me to do these do do that let me do that and as the servants they do they detached to that work they have been asked to carry a load at the back full of gold a servant will carry and I keep people over there they will keep it over there now you go he will go away so he never develops the attachment to of this goal or so much of gold if I could get one then I could be rich he never thinks in that way you know that whatever the salary I am getting that sufficient it belongs to my owner my the master is okay so in this world I am getting the appreciation I am getting the power I am getting money I am getting physical Beauty I am getting everything but I behave as if the my master wanted to have all this is okay any day he can take it away from me that is also okay the servant is also a realized soul but his attitude in this way is attached to God and third is the sakhya I am the friend of God so they are not afraid of God they'll be talking with the god they'll be having fun with the God there's a beautiful attitude that the in in a classically with the example classical example is a Arjuna and Krishna Krishna was God himself the Lord Krishna but Arjuna used to behave as if his friend they will be talking they will be that as the friends they are very free to each other and then come basilda I considered the God as my baby and how a baby can survive without a mother without a father without the caretaker Bibi doesn't know anything I have to take care of God so every morning I come and then say God please get up and then I am changing the bed changing his dress then the feeding him bathing him and then decorating him the people will come to pay respect you should be in time I am taking care of my God says beautiful attitude and motherly attitude the mothers they feel you know that wonderful the prakriti the nature sometimes give it in the mind of some people very dear people a clear devotion and there is no nothing in return oh my uh what I'm expecting from a baby can't give anything but sometimes the baby will smile looking at me and that is sufficient for me my mind become full with the smile of that baby and that is called mother's attitude towards God not that they don't know that God is all-powerful God can do anything God doesn't need anyone's help but the Heritage you don't know God is my baby so this is the beauty of the Hinduism the all are welcome over here all type of attitude it's not the one quote and you must have to put it on and if you are not fitting in it we will cut you down to in size so that you fit into it no no no no that is the beauty of the Hinduism it is for all it's like the ocean different type of attitudes of the Mind the Shanta the Rishi quietly sitting but the motherly affection they cannot quietly see it they are always careful about the baby when the baby will feed when the baby will fall when the baby will leave so all the time thinking about the baby and that baby is no other than the god so if we are taking care of our own babies considering them the living gods that also purify the mind that is the the bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling and then the madhura and there are some people who like to love God and the feel that they are God is my beloved there is a great lady saint in the vaishnava tradition and her father when she was very young her father she was she saw a procession a person is going to married and in India they usually do the the gentleman will be sitting on the horse he is going like a hero to marry and his followers the all these friends and relatives they'll be singing dancing and there will be firecracker and all that this procession is going on we'll observed that and she was interested and she told where that man is going father told he's going to marry and she told I also like to marry I love to marry whom I will marry just as a play the father there they were the worshiper of Lord Krishna the beautiful image of Krishna was there in the shrine and he told oh that is your the husband go and take care of your husband and she took it so seriously right from there her old soul was to that Krishna he is my husband then she grew up she was married to a King but even then as a wife she was doing performing all the duties but her mind was with the Krishna then ultimately the whole family misunderstood her they asked her to go away and she became completely free from all the duties all responsibilities and she used to say again and again every moment there is no two in my life there is only one and that is my beloved Krishna beloved Krishna it is not that God sitting on the throne and I am taking the food but these is my beloved I love him so going and embracing and in deep meditation she could feel that the Lord is embracing him embracing heart and she is feeling the touch of the god and it was so unique so wonderful so this is the way that sometimes the prayer goes so this we are understand the madhura now bhagavan sirama Krishna he is adding one more attitude the system to reach to God the fast was the Shanta the indifferent then the Dasha the servant attitude the friendly attitude basalya the affection attitude madhura The Lover's attitude now see ramakrishna is adding one more child's attitude the child they the child is all the time depending on the mother of the father but the child is not little baby that the child can play child like to go for played like to go and play with the friends and when the child is going and joining his friend or her friends now and then he or she will turn and see that the mother is sitting on the bench and she is satisfied her mother is there that much said if you have faith in the existence of God you are achieved God see friends this is called the uniqueness of Hinduism you need not to do anything only that God is there and God is my father God is my mother when I am going to my office I know the God is with me when I am going to do this I am going to do that I am going to play I am going to do this every time you know someone that God is with me the mother's care is with that that Faith only and you will never do anything wrong never harming others creating problem for others or abusing others and that is the constant control over yourself because the prakriti is trying to pull us down and another nature is pulling us up and that is called meditation constantly the good ideas good thoughts good Association that creates pull us up and another pulling us down my selfishness my ego my anger my attachment all pulling me down it is me only and again when I go and listen to the panchama Veda I read the gospel of sirama Krishna all these ideas that the bhagavan has given to us that pulls me up so this is called The Meditation up and down up and down as if we are churning the mind and when you are churning the mind one after another things will come and ultimately Amrit there is the peace the happiness The Joy the Bliss will come and it is not depending on any object it is from inside that Joy comes the joy of spiritual life why this spiritual life the joy right this moment he is telling only one step what is that step servant the servant attitude not that he is denying the others he is just mentioning one so that will be sufficient because these people egoistic people they were all rich people educated people the naturally ego was there and now we have to overcome the ego the eye when we overcome that ego then what happens he is giving the example of the prahlada he's the hero in the in in dualistic the path in the bhakti Marga the word he said sometimes I feel I am he and sometimes I am a servant that unless and until I am feeling that I am that God I won't be able to be a good servant or a friend or a lover or a mother or a child so this bhagavan Cinema Krishna is teaching us see friends it is the ego which is nothing but the Maya an illusion which is not actually there but the whole life we are suffering because of the ego we cannot adjust with others because of the ego we are fighting with others because of the ego I am persisting on my own idea own decision because of the ego but when we try to analyze what is this ego it is not there whole world is burning so many times because of the ego classed one leader with another leader first name the world was second world war millions and millions of people they died because of these ego clashes the leaders are all right somewhere there some are thinking oh I am the hero I won and another is hiding or killing himself that is the another way but what happened to this why it happened if you analyze you will find it is nothing but the ego clashes and when you try to go deeper to analyze and understand what is his ego it is not there nothing is there it's just superimposition imagination it is not the body it is not the mind then what is it a conception an idea in Sanskrit they say prantha is a completely wrong dharana idea so this ego we have to work on but it is there that is very practically it is there and we have to overcome the ego how bhagavan sudama Krishna said to keshava keshav Chandra Shane that you must take the attitude of a servant whatever I am doing I am giving he was a very famous orator the thousands of people used to come to listen to him so natural ego was there and the Clapping people are clapping the ego is functioning but who are you what you are telling is it your own word you have read from the books and those words have come down from the realized Souls you just memorize those and putting it beautifully with the words and you are taking the credit and you are taking the collapse and you are think patting your own back thinking I am so and so and you are going away from God so this he taught and to Captain the captain was sitting over there he said when a man attained the knowledge of Brahman he shows certain characteristics now he is mentioning most of the time we are deluded deceived some people in acting as a Holy Soul we don't understand them or they are half-eyed not talking constantly looking at the sky or sometimes saying very softly something and we think all the Great Soul Great Soul so I'm not doubting there may be great soul but what are the significant characteristics of those great Souls is mentioning in the bhagavata the state of a child very simple no ego at all and most of the time these people they won't talk they won't mix they won't look at anyone and then naturally you know the human curiosity if you are easily available people won't come to you and if you are not easily available people will run after you there are the our the belur Mart the unique place in the most holy place then our the Raja Maharaja Swami brahmananda all all the all the Giants of spirituality they all lived over there and their memories are over there but we like to go to a very remote corner and we'll be walking for seven days then on the back of a mule we are going over there and after falling on the back then we have broken my leg and then there is no food and after coming back we are so happy we went to the remoteest part to have the spirituality what spirituality now I broke on my leg and then what is this I'm just joking but be blessed that is okay but how it is the spirituality has nothing to do with the body nothing to do with the food nothing to do with the dress nothing to do with the place spirituality is nothing but clear understanding and that you can do anywhere in any dress in any time so that spirituality is there in the pages in the teachings of bhagwan's ramakrishna friends don't think that as because I am a member of the ramakrishna mission and I am following the ideology of sudama Krishna he is my God I am again and again propagating not like that you just open your heart and read the book and you will find all different types of problems in there in the spiritual life everything has been explained by bhagavan sudama Krishna at this moment we are really handling the most difficult part of the spiritual life the ego if there is no ego there is no you there is no God it is one Krishna himself be another we have already read and you will be reading again he is repeating again and again so that it goes into our mind deep into our mind he said one day SRI ramachandra was walking and then lakshmana he was also following SRI Rama in between Rama and lakshmana there was Sita and lakshmana could not see the Rama he was just in front of him but in between Sita was there giving this example not that Sita was the Maya just as because Sita was there though he was not very far still lakshmana could not see Rama in another place when the the the the writer of this conversation Master Masha shrima mandanat Gupta when the he asked said can one see God the sirama Krishna immediately took a piece of cloth and hole between the two they were sitting face to face then you hold that piece of cloth and can you see me no how can I so why not because the piece of cloth and that is Maya that is ego the ego is a carton that takes us far away from the god whenever the success is coming oh I have done it I have done and when the failure is coming a God is actually not helping me then we always blame God when we have failure but do we say that it is God only the when I am successful and all these successful businessmen if you go and ask them sir whom you will give the credit for your success he is a multi-billionaire and just because he is telling oh you are fired thousands of people they lost the jobs yeah like that and he is doing on and go and ask him it is me it is me it is me and who are you so friends in the whole spiritual life this truth this secret when you understand we understand everything but should we have to give up everything and become a jellyfish existence just lying down somewhere no sirama Krishna is coming to that SRI ramakrishna began to speak about the renunciation of action renunciation of action but he also said that those who failed that they must do their duties should do them in a detached spirit the best is to be completely free from any action but is it possible Sometimes some people the retired people will be sitting by the side of the road on a nicely and the smoking a Seeker looking at the people they are running here and there and he knows that I am retired I don't have any work he's enjoying the smoke but do you think he's not working of course he is working in thought all his memories I mean sometimes the good memories happy memories and sometimes the painful memories all passing through his mind and when he is looking at the passes by the people he is also comparing with them look at that man how nice shoe he is wearing where time was there I used to use like that so all the work is going on apparently he is sitting quiet and sometimes people will go into the Solitude all alone leaving I always say why you are going to the Solitude have you ever tried that whether you can become calm and composed and happy among the people who are not agreeing with you if they are not agreeing with you immediately you like to go away from there in the beginning it is all right but when you develop the spirituality what is that that is clear understanding what is that understanding people are like this I should not be disturbed by that now go in the bhagavad-gita there is a word he is not disturbed by anything people are criticizing it is okay not listening to his word okay I will do it but whatever I we have to do I will do and if when I am successful I know the gods willing so I am not requesting I am not going to take the credit but I have done it I'm not leaving it sometimes I have seen the people they will be leaving with the animals but not with people why ego clashes even though on children they cannot live with their parents why ego clashes it is my life it is your life what is my life so this is the way we have to understand nothing wrong a society modern society because of the different type of economy so it's okay I'm not going against anything but only thing those who are sincerely trying to develop the spiritual life you have to utilize the great force of ego and then you should reach to your goal what is the goal happiness what is the goal Bliss Joy and how it is possible avoiding people avoiding work quietly sitting no you have to plunge into the action but at the same time you should not be disturbed by a different reactions that will come out of that action that is the heroic way of doing so I don't care with the people are remembering me appreciating me or their assessment is different I know for sure whatever was possible for me I have done and done for the betterment I never disturb anyone for the betterment of all I have done it in a detached way in a detached way that that is the sadhana of the ramakrishna mission monks the ramakrishna mission monks even the brahmacharians the novices of course that time is there for them to practice quiet Solitude meditation but the challenges that you should have to take that is this you have to understand the ego is the main problem and I am going to work in the work when I say we should go to right there will be people who always say no left always they will say and you have to adjust with them and then perform the work very nicely and that is called yoga Karma sukoshalam yoga the union with God how it is possible through Karma what is that karma when you are performing it in a very clever way Su kaushalam very clever what is that cleverness I know that this is the way I am going to be not only successful but it will be beneficial for the society before that you are meditating you are praying to God you are feelings God shall I do it you have given this opportunity does it mean that I am truly for these I am talking about the the monastic life of the ramakrishna mission monks and the sarada mission Nance we don't have anything in this world we don't want anything but the it that this moment the world needs this in the Europe and America they are rich people their Advanced people but mentally they are suffering that disassociating each one is closing their doors and windows and they like to just leave with the the movie in the in the TV is that the human life why don't you come out and mix why don't you talk why don't you mix with people there will be differences but at the same time try to understand them and be with them and keeping your calm all the time why don't you take up the challenge in the bhagavad-gita SRI Krishna is mentioning to Arjuna go on remembering me and then plunge into the action like the war it is not the ordinary thing you are going and facing your enemies what who are there blood thirsty they like to kill you even you are fighting with them you are protecting yourself but at the same time you know all this I am doing at the Beast of the God God asked me to do it I am praying this is the attitude of the military Clan the government has asked him to go and fight they are fighting I don't know that person I don't I am not having any personal issue with him but I have to kill him because he is coming from the enemy a country and this is my order I have to carry out I am not touched by anything so this is so difficult and when you are working in the household can't we apply that so this way bhagavan's ramakrishna is asking he is very very beloved disciple shami Vivekananda but you know unless you practice meditation unless you practice japa the reputation of the God's name unless you are constantly contemplating on the spiritual life you won't be able to do Karma Yoga it is not only the karma it is the yoga and bhagavan sudama Krishna is asking keshav Chandra Shane and threw him to all of us you have to perform this there was confusion the people used to think syrama Krishna never asked to do this he was all the time asking the people to meditate to give up everything and all that and when Swami Vivekananda introduced that you must go and serve the poor people take the education to those who are not having education take the health care to those who needs that Health Care and go and serve them the monks and the nons they were supposed to be lonely meditating quiet and no you have to go that is ramakrishna Mission then there was lot of oppositions even the the monks the tradition of the monks so the all the other asramas the hierarchies and the and the Traditions they are telling what we become this teaching why the monk should work under told if everything is God those poor people are they not God they are the living gods and goddesses so go and serve them and when you are serving an image in the temple even if you are giving the untested food the image will nothing he won't say anything and you are very happy so I am a great worshiper I have given all rotten fruits to God but God didn't say anything and then afterwards all the best fruits he will eat and the sweet you will eat in the name of offering to God but if you go to serve the living gods and goddesses sitting over there on the street they will throw it on your face they'll say no we are not going to take it and you have to be humble because you know this is spoiled food I cannot give it to the living gods and goddesses so I was actually deceiving myself when I was worshiping a doll in the image but when I am going to worship the Living God that is the challenge can you take up the challenge can you take the position of a giver what is that Giver a doctor who is pouring the life-giving medicine to into the mouth of a child who is kicking him the baby doesn't know he doesn't like to take the medicine but the doctor knows it is necessary for the baby the baby will be kicking the doctor but the doctor will affectionately put the drop that is called karma yoga people don't notice it people won't appreciate it but you are going on doing and constantly remembering God so this the teaching of bhagavansi Rama Krishna after attending knowledge one cannot do much work the work means when I am going to reach to the goal but when I have already reached to the goal I don't need that bhagwan's ramakrishna gives the example how long you need a map a road map the I have to go from here to there before this GPS system there was only the road maps the people used to use those road maps to reach from one place to another place after reaching to that place that map is not necessary you can fold it and keep it in your pocket maybe you can give it to some of the else so for his future the use but that is over similarly we have to go to God and how we will go we have to cross the boundary of the wall a fence terrible veins of ego now how to scale that fence the ego by taking an attitude towards God and best attitude is servant attitude I am humble whatever you say oh my Lord I will do that so by that way when I am doing I am completely at the feet of that God in Hindi they are singing the one lady she was singing the Swami Vivekananda refused to listen to her song because in those days it was not actually customary to for the holy people to listen to the singers of the lady singers like that but the lady was very devoted when she saw Swami Vivekananda she saw the Shiva and she wanted to sing a song for the Shiva but Swami Vivekananda looked at the lady and he got up and was going away and without a heart she poured out her devotion through a beautiful song oh my Lord don't look at my faults some other you are the one among you are having the equal eye you don't differentiate between these and that that is you parakara the if you think please help me to Cross this ocean of samsara the BB gun that turned back and came and sat and listened not only that he learned that song He referred and sang in many places it has become very famous it's the one of the very famous song in the ramakrishna traditional he's called sadhana every day we should sing to the god the god I am weak I don't know what should I what I am supposed to do I am constantly tainted by your things you have kept so many things in this world so naturally and you have given me the eye the tongue the ear the nose and the touch they're always going to enjoy that please please please help me and as because I am weak don't discourage me because you are God all loving so this is the attitude I am humble at your feet and if you please help me I am sure I can finish the journey the journey that has started from you then I forgot you came out of you and now I have understood through your grace that I should go back to the source so the round trip will be completed I started my journey from the god and I complete my journey into God merging into God so becoming God that is the ultimate goal and what is that God Ananda that is all blessedness it is all happiness no desire no ego no aversion no attraction but a peace and happiness constantly so this bhagavan SI ramakrishna is mentioning the after attaining knowledge one cannot do much work because he has already reached to that point the how what is the necessary the tree look why so sad and pavari Baba was a great Yogi and yet he reconciled people's calls even lawsuits is given an example of a pavari baba haripo means the the ear ahari means he's to eat the air used to survive only eating air as if not that this is the way the people they mention actually used to eat less maybe that's why they gave now how can a person survive only eating air no that is not but sometimes the you know the people's peculiarity they like to see some peculiarity in a holy person the only person is not wearing the shoe holy person is not using the clothes holy person is not the saving holy person is not eating then holy person do not sleep then all sorts of things they always imagine it has nothing to do with that at the time of controlling the emotions controlling the the you know that our the different type of ah or the attractions it's some physical these things people should do but that is not the goal there is only the means as a child is going to the school back full of books and then the water bottle and the is that and also the Tiffin box they will go to the school and when they go to the colleges they don't carry you those things it is not necessary because the knowledge has already come to them they carry a notebook only to note down something nowadays only the computer they will take the computer they will reach from there they will answer from there they will not down over there and only small computer the laptop it has changed no in the olden days we used to take the books with us and the notebook and the pain and you people nowadays are not taking you won't get the knowledge no not like that because it has changed system has changed but the knowledge is the same and more intricate knowledge more advanced type of knowledges that it goes on its changes but knowledge is there if a student is not acquiring knowledge then he is not in student and if a devotee or a spiritual Seeker is not developing spiritual life then he is not a devotee he is not a spiritual Seeker he is not an aspirant so this if we understand then many other things whether these are that it goes away if that person has realized Brahman then he is not having any desire and when there is no desire at all but only prayer for the development of others for the benefit of others he is a realized soul whether he is having beard or not whether he is wearing shoe or not whether he is eating these or not don't bother about all those these are all external thing main thing is that man completely satisfied is that person is completely satisfied is he he is our heart the the desire completely vanished no personal desire nothing but a law pouring out for each and everyone there is no border or these are my countrymen I should love these are my followers I should love and not others these are my linguistic people so I should love not others these are my religious group if it is there he has just taken one step Maybe but it is not complete Journey complete journey is equal why because God is all pervading God is everywhere God is everything is [Music] so why you are hankering for the things over here in this world what is there except God nothing and what is that God is unselfishness and love so this if we can understand then at least in the name of religion all these big arteries will go away all this narrowness will go away and it will be only the love and unselfishness ramakrishna he is mentioning this and when he said the trilakya he was also one of the teachers in the Brahma samaj and you will learn it people but not that with spiritually advance but good people of course this to come to bhagavan's ramakrishna is to learn from him discuss so whatever he knew he said as sudama Krishna said God is compassionate some Chic devotee came before that there is a master said when the trailer said why so sad was a great Yogi when yet he reconciled people's calls even lawsuits ramakrishna said that after the realization of God the the action the renunciation of action that he about that he was telling the he cannot do much work and the work is that selfish attitude that were he gave the example of pawari Baba sirama Krishna see how though he is going against ramakrishna's idea he was not angry he said yes yes that is true was a great drunkard he used to drink 24 hours a day but he was he was precise in his actions he did not make any mistake in treating his patients there is no harm in doing work after attainment of bhakti but it is very hard one needs intense tapusha you are giving the example of the pavari Baba that pahari Baba did intense the Pasha then only he was doing like that otherwise it is very impossible it is God who does everything we are his instruments this is the statement of fact we are he is instruments so we are only performing doing those things which he the god the Consciousness wants us to do we're thinking I am doing no the time and the situation and the place and it becomes so that I am bound to do and as if the somebody is just doing through me but I always think people always think that I am doing it so one should be always alert about it I am the servant of God I am the Son of God I am the child of God I am the friend of God and I am doing what God asked me to do and I'm always satisfied I'm always happy why I am doing God's job only so this attitude gives a great peace and humbleness we will conclude over here friends and let us conclude with this stotra with this pranam mantra [Music] Drita by foreign mama [Music] oh Shanti Shanti Shanti huri Krishna must do
