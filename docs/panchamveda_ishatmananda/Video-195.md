this further when to Nevada class with this month tahoe confirm written dr g venom to be rewritten column shop on seven among the three models Adam Doval green and de bourree dodging are in our previous classes on mind we have read and discussed God alone is real and all else's imagery next class on 16th of this month Salam Krishna see God is both inside and outside and today we are going to discuss in today's topic is go beyond both knowledge and ignorance so they're a very interesting way this discussions are doing and Master Marshall he is recording it he's recording the count of the Sunday September 14 1884 Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room with Narendra power not the Mukerji brothers and other devotees Rahel was stained with Balarama at Brindavan and was laid up with an attack of fever now in the worse preparing himself for his coming law examination this description is now connection with a battery with ceramic business advises but why he is given the description the colors we should be really with the situation we should understand the situation Rocka we know for a long time now about him the master mache is giving us the information the he is living in the Brindavan with another devotee the Balarama and he is not keeping well Narendra is preparing for his final examination and all this now hearing about eleven o'clock a on Babu arrived he was a government official and had received for university degrees to think of it in those days for university degrees this was truly a very learned person and Saddam additional the man who used to go again and again time and again into the Samadhi look at his behavior how normally is the person who was nothing but God the person he is the highest form of the avatar and who is to go again and again into the NIP pickle for Samadhi look they're so normal he's master at the site of the iana Babu well well this sudden awakening of knowledge into the Sanskrit word gana means knowledge so salam o krishna is making fun with the name of the gentleman and he well sir well because Guiana is coming Jana Babu the person whose name is Jana the moment is coming any state in that way Jana smiling you must admit sir that one sees the weakening of knowledge as a result of very good fortune so that was the relation between the cinema Krishna and his devotees master smiling you are Jana then why should you have of Jana ignorance oh I understand her head there is knowledge there is also ignorant so this is the beauty of the Saddam of Islam from very ordinary conversation sometimes the jokingly pulling and immediately taking the whole conversation to the highest spiritual level whistling your name is Jana but why there is a Jana the he himself is giving the answer oh I understand where there is knowledge that also is ignorance the sage Vashisht was endowed with great knowledge and still he waved at the depth of his sons but she's the Muny he is to give the he gave the wonderful that conversation between sri ramachandra hand of a sister you have a sister sorrow the highest book of the vedanta the supreme be daunted rita Vacanti where only the consciousness is remaining and nothing else knowing that knowledge he knew that knowledge but still he was crying for his son today why he should cry because the German this universe this world is no man how it is possible but ignorance remain along with the gun nancy ramakrishna stirring therefore I ask you to go beyond both knowledge and ignorance therefore I ask you go beyond both knowledge and ignorance this is a speciality of Saddam apish no you always talk about the knowledge that the honor the but Tiana means what the moment you have that Jana you have that ignorance also so good you are both what will happen you will march into that truth then they'll be known that knowledge our ignorance and suppose we are going to know about the King and when you go to know about the King we know so many good things about the King some bad things also about his property about his wealth about his might and others but if you become king then you will know everything and you will go beyond this you need not to go and inquire how much wealth is having and this and that because you will be the owner of everything that is the indications Ramakrishna cook giving therefore I ask him to go beyond both knowledge and ignorance may be is beautifully explaining the thorn of ignorance has pierced the soul of a man's foot rather than the village's something their hated authorities they are sticking the blade that they will take out and the thorn in a thorny bushes are there with the help of the another part they will take out the first turn the Piercy in his fate and then throw both say giving that example is telling the tone of ignorance as peers the soul of man's food he needs the dawn of knowledge to take it out afterwards he threw heavy both tones the Gani says this world is a framework of illusion but he who is beyond both knowledge and ignorance described it as a mansion of Mart modular ot in Bengali the same mansion of Marta the full of joy why should I be afraid of this in the beginning when you are thinking about this that as we were discussing in 1880 you have to give up you to give up then at the same time we are coming to that particular going beyond the boat when it becomes everything is mine did no feel at all so that exactly when his son is young under the earth he is the variance his father has a car the Sun will take the key of the car and you will drive and be as much afraid when the father will come back and if he comes to know that I was driving so all this fear is there he's driving the car using the car enjoying the car but at the same time Vienna steel why he's not the owner and when the father comes over this time I could not resist my desire to drive the car so I did it and all that between he himself becomes the owner of a car whenever he likes you can drive and he's not afraid so fear that is there about this world of losing so I have realized this but I do not know what is going to happen next time so I say no don't come to don't come to me so all fear why I have realized God but I know the illusion of God is there outside so I don't like to once again be bound by that so these things goes on when you go beyond this turn what happens what are the illusions it is your control nothing can do any harm to you the stuff Easton is arching us to go to that condition which he has termed as big churning Gianna and began the knowledge and beyond knowledge or beyond means knowledge and ignorance both have gone now the condition completely fulfilled I am that and that is the condition of ceramic ISNA but he who is beyond the both knowledge and ignorance described it as a rational Marty sees that it is God Himself who has become the universe all living beings and the twenty-four cosmic considers that is ceramic dish now and we new know it you only eight others to serving the humanity that's raised in AMA pitch now when we were discussing about by schnabel but religion the part that dear they say that three things are there one is that you must do daya you must show compassion - the fellow-beings in the base novel the moment is it compassion moving into Samadhi Ramakrishna went into Samadhi and after coming back from the Samadhi he says no no no how you can show compassion to the another person who are you to say that instead of daya compassion Seva service to others then mind becomes humble a person become humble I am showing compassion to that person is below me so I am giving him money clothes and these and that I am showing compassion so ego is working it main work so he changed that in a sea is not the compassionate must be service Sheba this is Narendra not Swami Vivekanand the young boy of 1819 he heard that and immediately is it oh what a wonderful idea as because he was having the background of the scripture he knew in every being that supreme self is there how can hide them say I I will show compassion to you is it possible so this is sin omniscient he said go beyond these then you will understand it is nothing but you it is nothing but the consciousness it is nothing but the God who has becoming everything the wing that is the air Who am I to show compassion what I can do I can serve and what will happen if I can do that little when even benefit to me my mind will be pure so he goes on like this and a man can live in the world of threatening God that he can live the life of detachment in the country I have seen the women then immediately he is giving the example and the unique example and those who have lived I don't know nowadays in the villages with a still they are having that not not previously husking machine and they used to push one side then it will go up then it will go down and then breaking the rises so by that way he's describing that is it in the country have seen the women of the carpenter families making flattened rice with a dusting machine with one hand on thing turns the paddy in the wall and in the other hand she holds a nursing child at the same time she talks with the buyer she says to him you are you owe me two honors the staying two so that the calculation is also going paid before you go but 75% of the woman's mind is on her hand list it should be grasped by the best of the husky machine that is coming back so one must be very careful when using the hand and changing in the the padding so that Saddam pitched a living example and said a man should do his worldly duties with only 25% of his mind and devoting the rest of God 25% of his mind should be into the world that's all and exhibition and rest of his mind go to God so that that is the reason one takes the holy name the diksha so that constantly going on repeating the name of God and remembering God having the company of God just by repeating the holy name of God cinema business telling here referring to the Punisher sure that the Masters say to the devotees I found him monotonous engaged in the dry discussion of philosophy so we we are finding a unique ceramic Krishna he knew the whole knowledge but at the same time is telling the constantly discussing hand of this body I am NOT this mind whoever is coming they are discussing that way and all around people are suffering no no that is all Maya this is the very dry type of philosophy what see ramakrishna didn't like so he wanted us to become completely different weekly join one of our very senior swami he told you should do more yourself according to the ceramic richness idolized it's a completely different we are the daunting we started with anthem we follow the Ganga Salaam this means the embodiment of that also as mother cinema Shamim Sarif are dominant they be saved but at the same time our parent is little different time so sometimes I'm sure I also give it all the previa and the speedometer this takes us in a different height where we see the same consciousness manifested in all beings and under standing on that pedestal Shama vivek on the declare my gods are those whom you call it Noren downtrodden poor illiterate so they are the cause and goddesses why they do not know maybe education economically culturally their back world but we do each and every one of them the manifestation of the supreme is there I know that so they are my guards and there may goddesses suffering to the living gods and goddesses is call is to serve the living gods and goddesses millions and millions of dollars we are spending for constructing the building for God but the living gods are dying all over around they are not getting the education not food not shelter the small small children they are suffering but see we don't feel but we say we are the lovers of God the Salam kitchen they were like that that is exactly the teaching he say he alone who after reaching the nicked a victim is that hilt can well in the dealer the relative and again climb from the leader to the leader has right knowledge and devotion right knowledge and devotion Nikita and leader Nick turnings the supreme knowledge and Lila means all the same thing having different forms and names so I can see the same thing here too now what happened is like those who are acting on the stage I know every one of them so when they're acting as a king or other things I can see who he's acting as a king and he's these he's there at the same time when that is over then I can mix with them as the old frames sobota and enjoying but those who doesn't know the players and the actors and actresses they come and see and they see only that much but that person is a king that person is a servant that person is these so his knowledge is that much he cannot go beyond that they are also having another name and they have the family they have other identity if you know both so so much joy so cinema business telling Lena and need them Lillian is all different type of things that is happening and Nick there only the knowledge God is everything and nothing else but at the same time saving God manifesting in different names and form and he said those sang those sages had prema for God prema is the rule by which one can reach succeed on under such cheat or under this is the terminology of the Brahma the term Brahman has such chief under such means the knowledge eternal chief is the knowledge and under the police existence knowledge please but how I am reaching through prema prema means one pointed love for God so whatever I do I do in that way the other day the gentleman will be giving you the talking with you about his travel all over the world he was mentioning about the popobawa bow Hari o means the ear so people to think that he is surviving on the ear because very little used to eat and used to live the underground one small room and one peep came one day and he stole something man it may be a blanket or so and then the the sage immediately got up and he posed afraid he started running and when he saw the man is picking up his blanket and running he took another utensil that he was having the only utensil and he's chased deep and please please wait wait you also take this one so he was sinking the knew who he is coming to catch me and then he punished me so he was trying to flee as fast as possible but this man was also chasing must be very good runner because used to eat little so he was chasing and then found him and gave him and with great honor said you are not a thief you are my god here come to me you have given me this blanket you have given me this utensil it is all you give to me now you like to take in the form of a table why should I say no please stick away as long as I am having these two palms I can go and be I can take little water from the river and can drink I don't want anything else please take whatever you think you know what happened to that table he became a more comfortable he took initiation from Parvati Baba he became a disciple of Parvati Baba and who told a story that same him who was practicing austerity in the Holi he made sure me be recommended and he told him no what happened in his life so this is the way the people turn I am thinking now in a different way so everything the moment I think in a different way I a message so this is what exactly happens and cinema business talking about that a goal belong fields then one person has come this is master Mercia mentioning him as a sadaqa sadaqa means the person who is practicing as charity the friends today I will speak for half an hour and then the one gentleman is suddenly he has come is a Globetrotter and he'll be showing us all the places that he has visited and he will introduce us with a different world his experience for another half an hour so I will finish it in 5 minutes here the sadaqa the person who was practicing austerity he came he sat in the room of one cinema business his room was always open for everyone known unknown no reservation so he came he said and he is asking sir what is the wing you know the asking about the path of God realization even if you go to the northern India they will be always speaking in that way so Swamiji marked but like mark means but that we so please sailors how to reach to God Swamiji Mark Butler so what is the way faith in the guru's words Sudama business ate one attains God by following the Guru's instruction step by step it is like reaching an object by following the trail of a trade sometimes some people will be writing what is the quality of it good so least at least five or six qualities the Guru should not do like this guru should not do like that but then I was such has it written anything about the quality of the shisha you know it is not there so this is the problem the no one likes to alert everyone wants to teach but without learning this man has come I just read the conversation and will continue these in our next class he says said what is the way faith in the Guru's words 118 God by following the Guru's instruction still pasting it is like reaching to an object by following the trail of a thread then the shark is asking is it possible to see God cinema business this particular portion we should be very careful listening he is unknowable by the mine engrossed in worldliness please note he can be known by another mind purified mind but the mind which is engrossed in worldliness that is impure and what is purity thoughts of God what is impurity thoughts of the world that's all we always think about the purity and impurity what is purity the thoughts of God what is impurity thought of the world selfishness thinking about this body and mind as the par vollen and then going on developing all this so he says he is unknowable by the mind in gross team worthiness one cannot attain God if one has even a trace of attachment to lust and go but he is knowable by the pure mind he is knowable by the pure mind and the Buehring tillage ins the mind and intelligence that have not the slightest stress of attachment what is purity pure mind pure with the intelligence slightest attachment with the worldly things pure mind pure intelligence pure Artman are one and the same thing this is versa Ramakrishna say then shall occur he was giving the argument but the scripture cease from healing words and minds returned baffled he is unable by mind and words the that he is coating from the opposition the from the the mind and the speeches are all coming back without going in sedimentation or stop one cannot understand the meaning of the scriptures without practicing spiritual discipline what are you gain by merely uttering the word city and there is water in the milk turn the making to card then he journeyed only thing he will give the barter you're doing on quoting from the scripture is of no use Shankar Acharya after describing the whole thing in a beautiful way and the people who wish to code from different scripture but he said bhava curry sham adultery shastovich calico solemn there are people who can explain the beautiful way the meaning of the spiritual but no they are our King dinner's it is nothing to do it the realization they're good entertainers they'll be speaking and there are many people at the very famous people now they are giving it the all the TV people and all that they'll be going and taking the are the interviews from them and all that polygamous people borrow the entertainers they do not understand truly what it is so Saddam augustness say no not like that what will one give by merely quoting or hearing the scripture one must assimilate them friends I will stop over here and next class I will continue and try to understand what's ramakrishna meant by this so let us once again offer our respect to Salama Tichenor then I will invite the soul soul men some and they've not right and so men did not the cyclist word cyclist he traveled all over the world he will speak about that more than 150 countries he has visited and he'll be showing the places and the people and of course the time is really short half an hour and that will be wonderful so let us chant this mantra together but a Misha medium damn Ramakrishna she does after his speech and is showing if you have any question you'd like to talk to him so I will invite you to have the dinner with us and he will also go there you didn't talk to him thank you very much the t30 that said see Thomas [Music]
