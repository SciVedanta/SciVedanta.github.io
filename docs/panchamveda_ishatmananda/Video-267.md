[268: Panchama Veda 268 : The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcc8FQ7Ax9Y)

evening in the gospel of krishna the page 69 so the conversation that suramar krishna was having with some of the very educated and the main was and very interesting funky was not a and he was not ready to accept what sirama krishna was telling like other devotees he was going on putting his argument and sudama krishna that's very interesting to see he was going on trying to convince him siram krishna was speaking from the viewpoint of pure spirituality no materialistic the views no materialistic attachment uh expression but the boom kim was completely different his point of view com almost opposite to bhagavan sir ramakrishna but the conversation was going on master mashay has recorded those and people were enjoying they were trying to understand and it's good that bankim was arguing in that manner we came to know from bhagavan si rama krishna what is pure spirituality and when one wants to realize god truly wants to love god wants to see god what one should do now let us continue when bhagavan suramar krishna we the last class in the last wednesday we discussed that sirama krishna naturally there is a hindus they believe the the different uh uh the birth reincarnation so he was mentioning about that the banking was not that way very interested so when sirama krishna said when a man dies after attaining knowledge he doesn't have to go to another plane of existence he isn't born again then he gave the example of a boiled seed of course everyone knows if you boil a seed then if you even sow that it it won't sprout but if you are not doing that it may sprout that means if you have realized the brahman the atma gyana if you realize the god then you need not to go to another birth but if you have the desire deserve the worldly enjoyment then only you will take birth so this is what is happening but the banking he said sir neither does a weed serve the purpose of victory now it was not related what ramakrishna was mentioning we can understand very clearly that when there is no karma the karma comes from desire some wishes and when that is not there and obviously when one has realized the truth this world that we see is nothing but like a mirage and we cannot do anything in this world it will continue like this that this is the spiritual way but the people who have not gone to that what till tuesday bankimees are going on behalf of that be those people and the the purpose of a tree and the purpose of a weed are totally different sidhama krishna immediately this all we read and discussed in the last class he said what is this analogy is one-sided when you are giving the example you should understand that you are going to support your statement then only you should the boiled seed which is not going to sprout as if a realized soul is not going to take birth again that is very clear the way what you are talking about or mentioning about the weed and the tree it has no connection over here sudama krishna gave the strong argument and his eye said the same thing to keshav then he is continuing said is there an afterlife he asked the keshav asked then the suramar krishna gave another example to make him understand very easily the what is that that if you the that our potters they're making the things of the clay and put it before the sun and sometimes they will burn it heartburn so that is also there soft also are there suppose it breaks maybe an animal will run on that and breaking this what the potter will do this is important those parts which are heartburn the potter will throw them away why he cannot recycle it he cannot reuse it but the other soft thing even if it is broken he will keep mixed with water again in the on the wheel the same way against ramakrishna coming to that point if you have already realized god or realized the atman it is like the heart burn parts after the death no question of returning back to the circle of birth and death so this is very clear so bank him is arguing now here sirama krishna after giving this god then sudama krishna again and always he completes the whole so he's telling see god keeps some gannies in the world of maya to be the teachers of mean now sometimes some people and he's giving the example that the shukadeva and shankaracharya the shukur devashankar the very famous the monks and nyacins renouncers so this shukhadeva and shankara they were traveling they were leaving they didn't give up their body salam krishna himself it is there caitanya mahaprabhu why these because srama krishna never mentioned caitanya he mentioned about the sukadeva and shankara why they are acharyas they are teachers they are not avataras in that sense so sirama krishna when he is mentioning the shukhadeva is a teacher he's going and teaching the truth here we find shankara also giving the all this how the people should understand so that is what shankara he gave the explanation etc so they are the teachers if they are teachers so but they are realized souls when their realized souls were still leaving why this is god's will he keeps them though they were fully begged though they were realized but still they have taken the birth they were leaving for the betterment of the people so sudama krishna completed that then he is asking that way to bank him smiling well what do you say about man's duties so today's our topic is what is man's duty i quote from here twice the ramakrishna asked it and once bankim is giving the answer and second time suramar krishna is giving the answer this is very interesting then bankim is giving the answer see from the point of view of the very very worldly people and he is telling if you ask me about them i should say they are eating sleeping and sex life slam krishnan never could expect this type of answer so he is telling sharply friends we should understand that society apparently suramar krishna was no one in that society he was not that to be educated he was not having any money he was just an ordinary priest but look at the courage of the holy people they don't bother they are always trying to tell the truth and truth on the face of even and the fear bonky was the deputy magistrate even then sudama krishna very straight he said ah you are very saucy what you do day and night comes out through your mouth a man belches what he eats if he eats radish he belches radishes if he eats green coconut he belches green coconut by constantly thinking of the worldly things a man becomes calculating and deceitful on the other hand he becomes guideless by thinking of god a man who has seen god will never say what you have just said what will a pundit scholarship profit him if he does not think of god and has no discrimination and renunciation of what use is irradiation if the mind dwells on lost and gold very clear viewpoint of a spiritual person completely bogged down in worldly things and thinking that this world and its power and physical comfort and appreciation from the so-called society and all these things are great things they will never understand they will never understand the spirituality god love they may go to temple but for their own benefit you know that they will go and pray to the god and offer the gold and costly things to god and in exchange they will try to get some benefit from the god oh god protect me give me success and all these things so their mentality are completely different and sadama krishna the god himself he is teaching the spirituality and he is completely 100 percent more than 100 percent he's sure like any rishis of the old that this world is purely temporary when we i give this example again and again to remind me and also to uh tell our devotees that when the children are playing with the dolls that is very real for them and for the grown-ups what is that just a children's the child's play nothing else nothing else if some doll is breaking and the child is crying he is dead is not eating not having these not having that we all laugh and oh the don't orient them until we all write like that you say why because we are convinced that that is not the real thing the same way those who have realized god are the ishar avataras they look at us when we think the worldly respect and these pleasures and the money and these and that so-called power all that is as we look at the child's game they look at us in the same manner so this is what exactly sadama krishna is telling and you are telling us because you are bogged down into this and you are constantly belching like that one should not say like that then sudama krishna when he was talking like this there was dead silence other people the devotees who were there they understood sram krishna very forcefully he said that sirama krishna continued but like the swan are those who think of god who pray day and night to get rid of their attachment to worldly things and their love for lost and gold who do not enjoy anything except the nectar of the lotus feet of the lord who do not enjoy anything except the nec and to whom worldly pleasures taste bitter so this is a pure truth from the spiritual point of view and he mentioned about the swan it is all the time floating on the water but the water cannot make it wet so that is the swan sirama krishna is praising why it is that paramahamsa that is the concept of our scripture the paramahamsa when the lord vishnu appeared before the sun brothers in the bhagavata it is there he appeared in the form of a swan so it is very other holy for the hindus that this swan he is telling so it is with the genuine devotees they go toward god alone they seek nothing else they enjoy nothing else he was telling it teaching it everybody was quiet silent then sudama krishna as if he came down and then like a loving father tenderly to bankim please don't take offense at my words bhagim said i haven't come here to hear sweet things he is dead he is continuing in his own way then again the surama krishna is telling to ban kim the last and gold alone is the world that alone is maya because of it you cannot see or think of god lust means desire and desire the strong desire to enjoy and to satisfy the desire we need gold means the wealth the money the cerama krishna again and again using using these two words and the last and gold the desire and to satisfy the desired money so to earn money you have to work you have to do business you have to do this so again the another type of desire will come again you have to earn money it goes on non-stop then after you complete that then you start thinking about your children oh what they will do so i have to keep lot of wealth so that they can enjoy that and again the children's children what they will do it goes on and on the desire never ends the spiritual people they understand it the sudama krishna mentioning that and sudama krishna is telling this is the word what is word nama and rupa name and form this nama and rupa the name and form means desire and to satisfy the desire gold or the wealth after the birth of one or two children husband and wife should leave as a brother and sister and talk only of god this is the teaching for the worldly people why the desire should be controlled by this way then both their minds will be drawn to god and the wife will be a help to the husband on the path of spirituality none can test divine place without giving up the animal feeling a devotee should pray to god to help him to get rid of this feeling it must be a sincere prayer that this is the very important uh word because sometimes so many desires crops up in our mind it is con though we are practicing meditation taking the holy name of god but still the moment you stop and immediately these type of thoughts are coming like the hair scenes and if you remove the hair since from the top of the water is a very clean neat water but leave it again it come and cover the water so our desires are all around like the like a like a pond the mind is covered with desire if you remove the desire with the help of the god's name comes so wherefrom the desire is coming from the maya who is the master of the maya god so that's why we have to go to god and request him pray to him please remove your maya so that i can see you so the tranquil mind the mind free from all desires and there the reflection of god is very clear and we can see god even we can talk to god we can be in the company of god and that is so joyful the life is full with that and that is the reason all the religions and the scriptures that talking about this otherwise the world is there it gives us joy some little pleasure but then so much of misery if not the famous people maybe the actor actresses who had the idol for so many young hearts what happened to them that they com commit suicide why they were successful physically beautiful and they were having lot of money they were enjoying everything then what happens to them if we go to this question we'll find that this world can never give us the permanent joy and happiness and satisfaction so that bhagavan sirama krishna who the god who has taken the human form to established dharma the religion and what is that religion reminding us again and again about the truth and the truth is god alone is there and the world is nothing but illusory so he is praying and we should pray to god his teaching because the desires are there and because of the desire a mind is turmoil go to god pray to god and with the blessings of god desires will go away god is our inner controller he will certainly listen to our prayer if it is sincere the god is our inner controller govinda so he is there inside and if we pray to god he will surely listen and who is telling this that cannot be have any doubt the sincere prayer whatever the problem it may be if we sincerely pray to god and surely it will be solved and gold sitting on the bank of the ganges below the panchavati i used to say that sinama krishna now is giving his experience rupee is clay and the clay is rupee this is the mataka marti mati taka he said in bengali and threw both into the ganges sirama krishna did that why they are equal this the world that we see is nothing but the like the the art this is the we can throw it no one is carrying a lump of earth inside the pocket and exchanging it somewhere is the gold only so what is this gold just like this for a spiritual person now the listen to the banking and the banking is thinking from a different perspective from different point of view what he is thinking indeed money is clay sir if you have a few pennies you can help the poor if money is clay then a man cannot give in charity or do good to others we can understand the viewpoint of the bankim chandra he was not an ordinary person he was educated person well-established person a deputy magistrate but even then he could not understand the subtlety of the spirituality that viewpoint that sudama krishna was expressing that this is the problem that sometimes people the thing that we are educated we are having so many certificates and whatever we say that is true we can analyze but the spirituality is completely different thing the conception of the spirituality the god and the divine life is completely different thing than the world as long as the world is very important in your mind you can never understand it the banking when sudama krishna told a great word that is the inspiration for the spiritual seekers and for the people like the bankim he said ah indeed money is clay then sirama krishna to bankim charity doing good how dare you say you can do good to others now we can understand two of them sitting face to face one is speaking from the point of view of the spirituality pure spirituality where this world has no importance another he is speaking from the pure materialistic point of view and where spirituality has no value value is the of the world so bankim's viewpoint is from this side from the materialistic point sirama krishna from the spiritual point and sadama krishna is telling charity doing good can do good to others man man starts above so much but if one pours foul water into the mouth when he is asleep he doesn't even know it his mouth overflow with it and the proud man when he's sleeping with the foul water pools then that that's ramakrishna is telling where are he is boasting his vanity his pride so we are we don't know we talk about so much about our ego and i am so and so and suppose you you are sleeping or you become unconscious then what will happen to you anything where will be the that ego so sudama krishna pointed to that a sannyasi must give up last and gold he cannot accept it anymore one must not swallow one's own speech when a sannyasi give something to another he knows that it is not himself who gives kindness belongs to god alone how can a man lay claim to it charity depends on the will of rama a true sannyasi renounces gold and lost and gold both mentally and outwardly he who eats no molasses must not even keep molasses about if it does and yet tells others not to a householder of course need money for he has a wife and children he should save up to feed them they say that the bird and the sannyasi should not provide for the for the future but the mother bird bring food in her mouth for her cheeks so she too provides a householder needs money he has to support his family if a householder is a genuine devotee he performs his duty without attachment he surrenders the fruit of his work to god he gain or he's gained or loss his pleasure or pain the day and the night he pray for devotion and for nothing else this is called motive-less work the performance of the duty without he too must do all his work in the spirit of detachment but he has no worldly duties to attain to like a householder friends when he is talking with the bankeem chandra and he is whatever the banking is thinking that is okay but for us those who like to develop our spiritual life sannyasi or householder to what suramar krishna is teaching detachment the householder should be alert about his duty what is his duty to look after his family and to look after his family he needs money so he should earn money he should save money and he by that way he should perform his own duty and for a sannyasi he doesn't need those things but he needs detachment suramar krishna bringing the detachment for the householders also he is telling when you are performing that along with that if you have the detachment then both of you will get the liberation sannyasi performing his duties without any detachment not saving for himself because he don't have the responsibility of a family so whatever he is doing he is doing with a detached mind then and the householder is also doing the same thing but at the same time he should keep something as a reserve to support his family but the work and everything should be dedicated to god and should be performed in a detached mind it has to be now sirama krishna is teaching if a householder gives in charity in a spirit of detachment he is really doing good to himself this again as swami vivekananda said by donating or helping others we are not helping others we are helping ourselves but this is really very important how it is because when we are giving and giving with a mind of detachment or thinking that i am going to serve my living gods and goddesses my spiritual life is becoming strong and that is helping me ultimately the sudama krishna is also saying the same thing if a householder gives in charity in a spirit of detachment he is really doing good to himself and not to others it is god alone that he serves god who dwells in all beings and when he serves god he is really doing good to himself and not to others suramar question is repeating again and again the moment we think that we are serving others helping others ego will come as the bankim the he said if you have money if you have gold then you can help others in connection with that suramar krishna is telling helping others is good but it should be done with a detached way who am i to help others it is god only has given me the money and also the desire to help others i am doing that but when i am giving or trying to so-called the helping others i am i should say i am serving the living gods and goddesses that is pure karma yoga if a man that serves god through all being not through man alone but through animals and other living beings as well if he does doesn't seek name and fame or heaven after death if he doesn't seek any return from those he serves if he can carry on his work of service in this spirit then he performs truly selfless work work without attachment through such selfless work he does is called karma yoga this too is a way to realize god but it is very difficult why when we are doing anything immediately the ego comes but we don't understand that whatever little that we do if we can do with a completely the free from ego oh i am so blessed that i can do it so i am getting this opportunity to do that gives the satisfaction in the mind and that satisfaction always makes the mind so happy you don't bother about praising or appreciation or any other comfort i knew in brahmacari we were also the novices he was of almost of the same age and the same group but for some reason he was not accepted by the order because you know he was having some physical problem and the ramakrishna mission in the beginning when you are joining they will check up and say if you have any ailments any physical problem it because we come to serve so obviously the health should be all right the healthy body they accept that boy was not but he was staying in the asthma i saw him how wonderful he was must be in his previous birth he did a lot of tapasya so when he was not accepted in the organization he was not unhappy at all rather he was telling look at me the asamah authority didn't ask me to leave they have given me the permission to stay it was given to him as because he was not a monastic so he was doing as a volunteer he was staying over there putting on the the dress like a brahmacari and helping little this thing and that thing and i've seen when the he will be some senior will ask him go and prepare few cups of tea and bring and serve over here he will go to the keychain he will boil the water and while doing all this he'll be sitting and doing the jabba maybe for two three minutes maybe five minutes the water is boiling so he will sit over there on a stool and then taking the name of god when it is done again he'll prepare the tea with a smiling face he will serve and it was really something to learn from him so calm so composed so quiet while we were getting all the benefits of a brahmacari because we were accepted as a brahmacari he was not though he joined together with us we all together but he was so happy then ultimately the our authority they were happy with him accepted him uh and illegally they told whatever he is a very good soul so he was accepted league the in the the ramakrishna order as a brahmacari and so far i can remember that the year he got the sannyasa before that suddenly he passed away but all through the life he was so satisfied he was like a pure karma yogi he was to do do all those things at the same time completely detached i have seen another brahmacari who was junior than us and he was doing everything he was a very uh ardent devotee of lord siva and he was posted in kashi and he was so happy and at the 2 o'clock at 2 30 early morning he will get up go and bathe and bring water and bait the shiva and come back singing the name of god and doing all other then he developed something though i think cancer and he was supposed to die i went to see him but he was so happy there's no fear at all then and i told that the doctors have already said that you are going to die within this many months are you not afraid the swamiji the day i was born it was fixed that i am going to die maybe little early but why should i be afraid the only thing that i could not finish the my tapasha in this life again i have to come and take birth and finish my tapasha so that is i'm praying to lord siva and praying to sheba that i should be with him all the time so that is my prayer and nothing else so this is called courage understanding the religious the truth the tremendous courage not at all afraid of death as rabindranath tegan many of you must be knowing when he said he wrote the modern you are just like my god shama means the krishna you are like the my beloved krishna i am not afraid of you brother i love you because you are breaking this body and mind i am going to mix with my god that is the unique conception of the spirituality and sunama krishna here he mentioned the true devotion and this little para that we have just read karma yoga you mentioned through the karma yoga that too is a way to realize god the karma yoga is very difficult because the ego may come but if one can remove that ego and whatever little work they are doing if they are dedicating it to god and very happy all the time meditating and thinking that god is looking at us when we are working that will be sufficient for the spiritual practice now krishna i am continuing reading from here therefore i say he who works in such a detailed spirit who is kind and charitable benefits only himself helping others doing good to others this is the work of god alone who for maine has created at the sun and the moon father and mother fruits flowers and the corn the love that you see in the parents is god's love he has given it to them to preserve his creation the compassion that you see in the kind-hearted is god's compassion he has given it to them to protect the helpless whether you are charitable or not he will have his work done somehow or other nothing can stop his work this is the truth we think that we are helping the world we think that we are helping doing this and that nothing that's why when the arjuna he was telling to sri krishna no i won't fight because this is not good why should i kill my kit and keen the lord said to convince him that this it has already been done now i have given you an opportunity to do it as a shatria hero you should do it that's all and if you don't do it somebody else will do swami vivekananda also mentioned and we should remember again and again those who are following the the ideology of krishna vivekananda whatever opportunity that we get to do something god has given us and we should accept in that way oh so much of what the god has given why should i do or this type of humble work that he has given whatever it has come i should perform and with great devotion and with best attention and perform with perfection and then we'll say god thank you that you gave me the opportunity to serve you and that is the way slowly slowly god will take all your work and one day as because for everything every moment we are thinking of god only while working why am so blessed god has chosen me to do this work anyone he could choose but i have been chosen swami vivekananda was one day he made ma sardamani devi and naturally people they were talking very highly about him he was so successful in america but he was a very very humble person he went to maha sharadamani devi and said mother like me you will get millions of sons sh vivekande is telling like me like swami vivekananda oh mother you will have millions of sons but one thing i know it very sure i will never get a mother like you you are peerless so this is humbleness without ego all that we do all the success that comes is nothing but the god's grace one should be very humble and here as the surama krishna is giving the whole page we will read he is talking about the karma yoga to make the our bankim chandra understand that with the money we can help that the conception that is not true even the rich people they will never do anything so if you look at the all around you the millions and billions of the people that they're having so much of money but the poor people the workers they are worth going on food because they don't have anything to stay no food no job not even money to spain for a trade trained ticket but the rich people they will look at it and they will think if we spend ten thousand dollar then it will be reduced from our budget and these and so much of calculation they will do but if there is an an opportunity for a throwing of the party the fifty thousand dollar and the one hundred thousand dollars without not thinking anything that they will spain and what actually they will do wasting and nothing else they think oh the friends will remember them and they have fade nicely and they will be nothing and nothing and nothing we don't understand these and one thing more god is also very choosy if a man is very egoistic and he doesn't like to spain for the benefit of others god doesn't like to accept his money too that is also true so the humble person only can donate when some people they donate donate for the true cause it is only because the god wants to take their money otherwise they won't be able to do that what then is man's duty the second again krishna is repeating the same question he asked the question to the banking and when the banking give the answer he became very angry then afterwards again after telling all this thing what then is man's duty now this time he's not waiting for the answer he's giving the answer the bhagavan is telling what else can it be it is just to take refuge in god and to pray to him with a yearning heard for his vision what is the duty of a person a man's duty means the duty of a person it is only to pray to god to take refuge in him having faith in that shambhu said to me shambhu babu was a very rich man a landlord it is my desire to build a large number of hospitals and dispensaries does i can do much good to the poor this is the point the desire to do good to others is okay i like to build hospitals and dispensaries up to this it was good but the second line when he's telling does i can do much good to the poor srama krishna immediately rectifying him he is telling i said to him yes that is not bad if you can do it in a detached spirit i am going to help know in a detailed speed it is but to be detached is very difficult unless you sincerely love god and further if you entangle yourself in many activities you will be attached to them in a way unknown to yourself you may think you have no motive behind your work but perhaps there has been grown a desire for fame and the adversing of your advertising of your name then again if you are entangled in too many activities the pressure of them will make you forget god i also said to him shambhu let me ask you one thing if god appears before you will you want him or a number of will you want him or a number of hospitals and dispensaries if one realizes god one doesn't enjoy anything else has tasted seed up of sugar candy cannot enjoy any cannot enjoy to a drink made from common tarsals molasses as you can see so this is what about the karma yoga swami vivekananda has a complete book about the karma yoga shanghu the first line was very appreciating that i liked to build because he was having the money he could spend in that way i will be able to help that is rama krishna he said one should not think in that way friends those who are in calcutta are associated with the ramakrishna mission you must have heard the name of swami dayanandaji he was the disciple of maha sharadamani devi he came to america to spread vedanta but then seeing the wonderful very good services in the hospitals so he went back to india again to start a maternity hospital his sister passed away perhaps the super i know i may be wrong and at the time of giving the child birth so that he was suffering why then so many young mothers in in those days the no good hospitals were there in india so even before the independence so the swami went back so when he came to america india was a really really a very poor country so now leaving america the life of comfort and so to say he went back to india with a desire to start a maternity hospital so that the mothers can be saved he learned a lot about it then he approached the headquarters of our belured mart the belurmat was wondering what is it if you start the hospital then how the work will continue who are going over there because as a monk you have to be all the time with the ladies and that is not possible so there was a lot of argument then finally the beluremot authority said and very interestingly they were two brothers and one was the general secretary that mr debate and the young brother dhyananda ji he was requesting the his brother who was the general secretary to give him the permission ultimately the permission was given by the trustees to start in hospital but with a condition that you should be there all through after few days when the start work will start and you will say oh no i am not liking it you cannot leave it could not go away you have to give this war that you will continue he gave that and slowly those who are near in calcutta and is a one of the very famous hospital the huge hospital and very good system over there for the maternity section the nurses training and so so many now it is a huge and he started with some tin shade one or two rooms so that humble beginning i have seen that swami he was then retired offer was given to him i heard we were all young at that time i heard that offer was given that you should become the general secretary of the ramakrishna order he refused to know i have given the word that i will continue till my death over here so i won't leave so this is called karma yogi when he retired the young swamis came they took the church and they were maintaining naturally you will feel they are not working in my way but he won't say anything he was there present over there but at the same time completely detached the old the doctors and the nurses sometimes used to come to him to complain against the new administration but he would say no it is not that you should not come to me about this i have resigned so it is not me to give any decision he was there but at the same time he will never ever get entangled to any daily activities this is called karma yogis there are many like this so they have worked not that we should not work we should do but with the attitude that we are serving god with an attitude that we are humble we got the opportunity to serve god so that is what bhagavan suramar krishna is telling so the same question that he asked bankeem chandra chattipad got the answer the worldly things that the banking gender was in that they said like that but sirama krishna is giving us the teaching that we should should not say that i am going to help the people that is the way of egoistic way of detailing brother we should say i am humble that i got the opportunity to serve the people those who build hospitals and dispensaries and get pleasure from that are no doubt good people but they are of a different type he who is a real devotee of god seeks nothing but god if he finds himself entangled in too much work he earnestly prays lord be gracious and reduce my work my mind which should think of thee day and night has been wasting its power it thinks of worldly things alone pure soul devotees are in a class by themselves you cannot have real love of god unless you know that god alone is real and all else illusory you cannot have real love of god unless you know that the world is impermanent only of two days existence while its creator alone is real and eternal this is the ultimate teaching of our scripture and nothing else the brahman alone exists the god alone exists and this world that we see at so temporary and why we are wasting our time thinking that we should do this and we should do that if we are rectifying ourselves there may be doubts then shall we not do good to the world can we really do good to other world we may for some time reduce some problems but again it will come up again that will be like that if one part of the world is becoming good another part will be suffering another part will be so this is constantly like the rheumatism sometimes it is in the shoulder sometimes it is in the west sometime it is in the knee but in the body constantly changing and giving us the pain so what we should do we should try our best to do good to others with an attitude that i am serving the living god not that i am doing good to him rather i am blessed that i got the opportunity to serve the god friends you will study again we will continue the conversation between this suramar krishna and our bankim chandra the very interesting way they are talking and we will continue and again after so much we will hear how bonking is reacting so that is very interesting so sirama krishna is not leaving his own point and bonkin is also not leaving but in between we should take which is the best thing that suramar krishna is teaching to us so now if there are any question so there is one one question us is from maya surrounds us from every corner can we get rid of maya by praying of course the as dushmanta babu as i told you that maya is the power of god and now it binds us and if we go to god and say oh lord please help me from your maya god can help us it is like a fearful dog barking at me and i can request the owner of the dog so can you please tame this dog because i am new the dog is barking i am afraid then the owner will
