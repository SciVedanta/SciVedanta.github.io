tabooo khatam written dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma shop ahom Savannah mangalam srimad artem booby Goonan te borre dodgin aha in our last class we were reading in the Gotham Rita and Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna he was explaining the vastness of Brahman the word the Brahman are the Othman the permit man that we say but we don't have any conception we do not have any idea we only utter the world the moment a person can even intellectually able to understand the vastness of it what will happen to him that he says he'll be totally quiet he won't be able to speak won't be able to express because of his direct perception direct knowledge that is so vast so magnitude but can he anyone understand the totality of it no no one see Ramakrishna is telling and his serama kristin is telling that the shuka diva the greatest sage even he stood on the shore of the ocean of brahman if we can imagine that the brahman is a sea ocean then sugar only stood by the shore of that see and then saw touched that's all so a portion of it you can imagine the one cannot see the whole thing whole ocean impossible so vast so deep and in different places different type of things at theater obviously what he meant it is only he saw and touched the water even then the sugar became so great so now you have to imagine we have to imagine how vast how big is this when some people in the name of religion they'll be saying that God is this that see Ramakrishna said for you it is okay but don't say he is only up to that he is only that much don't say in his own word ma to our booty motto amines the small mind and he thinks it that is the same thing Swami be bacon understanding over here in this August huge Assembly of the parliament of religions he said the story a frog in the well because of that each and every one those who were reading the paper the spiritual people and all of them they were demanding ours is the best then indirectly be wakin on the seed the frog in the well pairs it is also water but don't compare with the ocean the well water is also water but it has a limit don't compare it it as a frog came from the ocean and he fell in that well then they were conversing the frog in the well who was born and grew up over there and has seen nothing then he was telling went from you are from the ocean is it then he gave a lip and said is it so big your ocean when this fellow said come with me no I won't go I don't believe you there cannot be anything bigger than my well and that is called mo to our booty your thought is only up to that so thin we quoted from the Mohan near van Tantra is not only ceramic ISNA the Mahoney ruben tantra year to be shumsa mood bootham from where the whole universe has been created think of it the thing which can create the whole universe not the world universe can you imagine it in a rotten dirty study after that after the creation is staying over there leaving on it old universe is living on that such a big big yes means our valiente in that all Marge's gium that brahman luck shin-ae that is brahman is they are not telling like that it is an election that maybe that Brahman so this is the vastness of as you call Brahman even the Shiva shamita it also said but chido yet oh nasty it has no cover it is no break Perry chido yet oh nasty deja collar suruba thom hartmann sir batatis man atma bernina babbitt kila and that is why markali is not having any coverage no nothing is there how can she because she is the creator mahakali that image that we see is the image of Brahman just to give an idea some time to teach the children we will be giving a shape so that they can at least understand this so that way when you say this is a river the small River will be there then the boats are flying fishes that their child can understand oh this is the river but is this the river the similar way mahakali she is also like that nothing can cover us these robust so big bigger than hard is nothing that is the reason that without any clothes macaulay black because you do not understand salam o Krishna is explaining we cannot fathom we cannot understand we cannot gaze we do not know clearly that is why she is black black is the symbol of ignorance and constantly she is leaving heart mana because she's standing on Shiva Shiva is the symbol of Chaitanya consciousness constantly unconsciousness and she is creating so it is rained that we see the color of red is the color of creation so that we and then in the ciggy again we find in the cat who Venetian it's his neighbor barcha Hannah Manasa prop to shopko nach akshara barcha the words it cannot express the Manassa even the mind cannot think of it grasp of it and I cannot see it Asti teeb rubato only it is the air we can feel that that much you can feel that it is there that much so in every scripture we find the same thing is going on telling about that in reply to one devotees question suppose a man obtained the knowledge of Brahman in Samadhi dazhe speak anymore someone who has realized the Brahman have they said anything about it the devotee wanted to know and ceramic ishness reply one after another he is coating Shankar Acharya is a person who realized the brahmana retained his ego of knowledge ego of knowledge means wanted to tell people I have to tell people that way Shankar Acharya was thinking so he was leaving why he was leaving just because of that I have to tell people about God so that they can also become good when we go to some place where you find the people can develop agriculture horticulture they can help themselves in so many different ways what do you think many many many of the people they go out to help people why because they feel for them when you see that the children they are simply playing and wasting time we feel like going to demand till now go or study don't waste your time if you don't study you won't be able to happy you won't get the respect in the society you have to study you have to become somebody in the society why because we feel for them Shankar Acharya ramanuja madhwa sri ramakrishna chaitanya scribes all they came out and traveled and went to the people what for they felt for them otherwise why they never wanted anything back from them nothing that is the reason this is a wonderful love a compassion what we feel for this type of people some people they get joy giving me torturing people seeing their plight to get choice so so many stories will be there in the newspaper as some people will be there constantly helping they'll be going out helping them it's not necessary but still they will go so this is duck temperament the mentality those who are helping we always considered them good people in our society and those who love love those whom they don't know they are chords godly people so that's why see ramakrishna is telling Shankar Acharya retained the ego yes I had to do I must go I must help I must tell there's a ego of knowledge that's why he was surviving otherwise you'd have passed away long man the moment did they get the knowledge realized that Brahman understand that he is nothing but this Brahmin a passes away then he is giving the example the big bosses as long as it is not sitting on a flower when the people they try to get the knowledge realize they go on seeking knowledge as a bee is going on hovering on the flowers and trying to get then afterwards when he's sitting on a flower sucking the honey it is quite but afterwards sometimes it will be creating some knowledge just out of his joy empty Peecher mix gurgling sound when it is dipped in water when it is Phillip it become silent the similarly it is people like that the moment they realize God they become silent they cannot express and they don't like to break the joy but he comes to the practical level and says bought in the Kali Yuga man being totally dependent on food for life cannot all together shake off the idea that he is the body the whole purpose of religion is to forget the body consciousness I am a body I am these and that that consciousness of to forget that's only when you meditate what we do try to forget the body consciousness those of you who have taken the initiation from our gurus you must have been instructed that you have to see your Easter try to visualize your Easter within your heart first second how the history is sitting facing that side in the direction you are facing how does it mean but the Easter sitting inside me is inside my heart and facing to that side where I am facing then how I will see if the issue is just opposite to meet it so easy for me to see when he is sitting within me then I have to come out of my body and then can see that the Easter is sitting within my heart and that is called meditation what is meditation you have to imagine that you are nothing but the god yourself when the seat for puja what do they do you try to imagine every part of his body is transforming becoming holy then only they can do the puja otherwise not raghavan see Ramakrishna only by doing puja you are showing it he was Bhagavan from his birth before birth and after all sir but you are showing the true puja one can realize God and how he was feeling that whole body is transforming so that is the way now as because we are so much connected with the body weak body consciousness as so much we cannot forget it all around us the people are also trying as best as they can to make us always feel that we are nothing but body those who are producing any anything immediately they will give the advertisement body body body you like to do these electro duties you let you do this the body Gong in previously it was not so much in college oh that is so much then what will happen those who go for vacation here there where do they go what do they do if you simply think you funny only they will go to some place what they will do they will go and sit and they will eat and they will go and sleep and then after the vacation you go we had enjoyed our vacation what you have done same thing that they were doing in the houses so what so this is the thing we cannot go out of our body wherever you go we only do like this in the Kali Yuga man being totally dependent on food for life cannot altogether shake of the idea that he is the body in this state of mind it is not proper for him to say I am he one should not say the guiana yoga means what gianni means knowledge what is that knowledge I am nothing but God but who can say that who has forgotten who has transcended his body consciousness then only he can say that otherwise not Jesus in one place he is telling come and give all your body to me and you enjoy who is this Jesus how come that he says that come and give your burden because that very moment when Jesus is telling he is not the person that we see he is the God Himself then only he can say otherwise not when the Sri Krishna is telling sarahbeth Herman bharatiya mommy come share an umbrella you need not to do anything only remember me that will do one person came to see am Krishna and he was telling sir what will happen to me I am an ordinary person with so many members are there in my family to look after I have no time to sit for meditation to do japa to go to Temple and a puja because I am working so hard to Ernst little money so that I can feed so many people day in ceramic ashna said yes but suppose early morning you get up and do little chopper early morning what do you say the moment i get up i ran for wading birthing and then I go out I have no time ok suppose before going to be it I am so tired I cannot think of the moment I return I feel like going to bed and I just sleep like a log I cannot do you take the name of God at that moment the enzian squizzy yes but suppose you are working moving at that time can you remember me for years I can remember you because I have seen you I know you I am having the conversation with you I can always remember you there is no problem then remember me and you will be saved who can say like that of course many people may simply say but they know he is not going to be said and I am NOT also going to be so that is not the way but originally the people were really spiritual ceramic is nice telling can you remember me then you are saved that means he is God the moment you remember him all other things why they are all the time insisting that you have to remember God because there are two things one which is consciousness another unconscious or inert if you think about those things inert to naturally you will be like that but if you think about the consciousness you will be consciousness that is why what is mantra what is diksha what is the initiation what do they say they give only a name of God what is that God consciousness is not the ordinary name is not an ordinary sound consciousness the moment with failed you are thinking that name is completely changing me you are changed and if you are not it is not so this is the way I ramakrishna is telling so we have to realize God in this modern age through what he is telling a man cannot leave on the roof a long time and the roof of a house he cannot seat over there for a long time yes to come down you have to go to different rooms maybe have to go to the key chain of the bedroom like that living room so that we had to come down then he is telling when you are singing you cannot be on the top the tune constantly sorry gamma pada knee knee is the highest he cannot be there for all the time you have to come down similarly for the knowledge the path of knowledge leads to truth just great that way the knowledge what is that knowledge I am NOT the body I don't want all these things Nadine 18 not this not this is the path of knowledge I know whatever i see is nothing but changing and what a ver is changing is going to be destroyed someday so I don't want all this habibi bahaha beneath Tahiti with the small young boy he went to the Yama and he wanted to know about the Hartman Brahman the eight years old boy you must say why do you think about that Brahman even the gods cannot understand that is very difficult rather i will give you so many things you see all these they'll be dancing they'll be singing for you enjoy the world what the boy said Toby bah bahah taba litigated all those things of enjoyment let it be yours I don't want that why some day or other is going to be destroyed I want the permanent knowledge the knowledge of art Minh so here see ramakrishna is telling that knowledge of Earthmen you can reach but the ordinary people cannot do like that then what they will do again is coming the next step the way our path of knowledge leads to truth as the path that combines knowledge and love there is another path is also their way is also there through which you can reach God not only knowledge is a combined love and knowledge why love because it is present within us in each and every small little bird is flying here and there whole day collecting like little food and bringing it back to the children the small little the birds are there then they will be feeding where from all these things have come because it is natural that love is so natural in every being loved is present if we utilize that love knowledge is very difficult we have to practice accurate but the love is already present why not combine this two then he is telling the knowledge and love the part of lab to TW the path of love to leads to this goal where knowledge is reading the law will also take this is the beauty of the Sanatana Dharma they always considered the condition of the people if you go and give a lecture in the the kiddies school what will happen you wouldn't understand anything but if you do something which they will understand and that way slowly take them up that is the best teaching in the Sanatana Dharma we also find like this the yogi the Gianni the Ghani and the laptop the meditation path of meditation the path of knowledge path of devotion and part of karma unselfish work though you cannot think of it the some ladies they are coming and helping me to transfer transfer my office over here how hard they're working without expecting anything rather they're bringing so many other gifts and they are coming cleaning though also many books varieties of books all day long when their mother sage they are working i am digging rest myself where I felt that at least 45 one however I should sleep but they are working working working the next mod afternoon when I came back there as energetic as before so that way they are going on serving how why because of love love forward love for God how they're reaching God not by meditation not by prayer but through work so many people are working everybody is working but working with an interest the I will get the money I will get the salary I will get there also many things are there when you are working for love the same work become a part to God realization yes see Ramakrishna stealing knowledge and love love also leads to that then he is telling the big Johnny the new word is adding with the spiritual conversation religious conversation v gianni the scientist that what is usually used in the mundane knowledge but he is using it here the beginning the scientist of the spiritual world sees that what is Brahman is the Bhagavad what is Brahman we were just discussing what is Brahman so vast all-pervading that comes and becomes Raghavan this is a wonderful word that has been gone and given to the ordinary people like ours we go with so many things gift to God and then sit at the feet of the God and we pray to God and we feel soulless we get back our energy God please give me this please do this please do not do this we are talking with the god conversing with the God seeing God praying to God crying to God and then we'll be all early morning they will get up bed with the fresh clothings they'll be cooking for God and then making so many things for God and what is that God they don't know but they have a faith there is something which will surely accept my food so this is the beauty sometimes some people they'll be giving something to God and then we will keep knowledge I have been keeping the track where that is going wrong oh I give that where is gone it has not come over here i have not got the Prashad who got it like this if they go on that is not the puja the moment you offer to God it is over I am given to God God has accepted that's all so that is the way if we do then see Rama Krishna is telling he who is beyond the three gunas is the Bhagavad how can understand Raghavan who is a gabon beyond three gunas sattva Raja and tama never bound by all this thing sattva Raja and tama there is no hit rate in the mind because he is beyond that all guna the moment you start discriminating then we are not beyond that so that is the reason sattva means good qualities Roger active qualities thamma is not bad qualities but they are beyond these three gunas they are not bound by that the Bhagavad means he who is beyond the three gunas with his six supernatural power 6 supernatural power now the god he has created everyone is telling all religion this belief God has created this universe God has created the human God has created these God has created that in the name of God I promise if God wheels then it will be done one lady rang me and she was telling I like to come and meet you at locate now I will try to come inshallah she is a Muslim insallah if God wills I also some time writes in the later insallah to the beautiful world if God wills then only we can do it that that way we have a total faith in God and Eve God wheels then only it can be done otherwise not and very small small thing whatever happens if you are having the faith belief is no anxiety in our mind I will try my best but after that suppose it is not done it is the will of God God never wanted it so I could not do it God wanted it I could do it there is no problem for me so that way one can be free from all anxiety look at the whole world people are so anxious under the anxiety why because they don't believe in the supernatural power but if you go and believe in the god one person was there he was very very God loving person doctor and he was a king and one day morning is the right time he was sitting over there and worshipping and the half way certainly some people came and reported king and the enemy they have understood they have also keeping an eye and keeping track what you are doing they know now not that you will be worshiping and you won't get up so now they have invaded our country with the huge force they are coming plundering destroying what he will do he told him go away I don't know then he looked at the God and said what do you want to mean to do now shall I get up and go for white or shall I complete my puja then he failed it in his mind complete your puja okay what will happen they will come they will take me to at some other place or making in a keep me in the prison or kill me something will happen like that whatever let it be but i am not going to stop my puja he SAT over there and started doing his puja when he completed all his people were shouting jaya jaya kar what happened they're all glory to our King lorida working loading working but I was sitting over here I didn't go anywhere now who said you came down you laid us our army you fought so fear of ferociously and we have driven them out you did it o king you have forgotten it then King started crying he came back to God and he said for actually for me he have done so much so that is if we have the total faith on god it happens half of you don't do i am doing worship at the same time we are also what will happen what will happen that undue totals are in there is very difficult again very difficult now here's ramakrishna stealing the god is having six supernatural powers then he is telling living beings the universe the mind the intelligence love renunciation knowledge all these are the manifestations of his power we must understand it some people they are so proud of their knowledge so proud that they are intelligent so proud that they have make so much of money wealth but if they forget only because of the god last birth they did good things and they prayed for that they wanted dead so they have got this that's all so if we don't remember this what happened again we have to go down the like that fairy will it goes up we are so happy we are on the top of everyone now after some time again we are the bottom of everyone at the end of it it goes on like this the life is like that so here he is telling and look at it he didn't say everything God has done everything orders them but particularly here in this line Serrano Krishna is mentioning living beings living beings means the prana the soul it has been created by God and then this universe everything that you see the universe mind the so intelligent mind conceives everything then the intelligence then the love then renunciation and knowledge we are sannyasin we have renounced can you renounce is it so easy no one can announce oh we are in bondage are you really know so this way everything depends on God and when the Rockefeller came to swami vivekanand of the first time vivek on the side you have made lot of money wealth why don't you distribute some of your wealth among those who are suffering why should I you are good I have used my intellect my power my energy and I have got this money why should I go and give it to them let them out I don't know it is not written but perhaps rami be back on the forwarded this argument suppose tomorrow morning you get up and find that you had a stroke and you cannot do anything you can't talk you can't think then as a jellyfish existence in your life what will happen you are now boasting that you were intelligent you were so capable any moment anything can happen next day he came back next day means after some time and he showed the huge amount he has donated that you can thank me he said to Sharma ji Shami she said quietly you should thank me i have saved you from the hell so that way if we see whatever quality that we are having it is be cause of him so he must be humble constantly and constantly pray to God whatever I am having is just because of you oh god please keep my mind at your holy feet so that I can have the faith in you hear the six qualities of bhagavan the sri ramakrishna is telling and see see the very wonderfully they have explained kapila muni the many of the people some of our devotees they will be going over there after some time that is in the almost at the end of the Bengal there there's a the money that had a temple is that it's still there this kapila this kapila muni he was telling to his mother he was a young boy his mother died bothy she came and she told son everybody is telling that you are you have realized God and they are receiving advices from you can you please tell me something about God then kapila told there's a wonderful conversation and when one place he is telling none nah yuge amanha bapta bhagavati a lot money sadri shows toshiba ponte yoga nam Brahma CTE in a Bhagavad it is mentioned to realize the all-pervading brahmana to realize the all-pervading brahman the most effective and the best path is bhakti kapil is a man of knowledge is a path followed by not only knowledge and yoga and all that but when he's talking to his mother he knew the mother won't be able to understand this so he said see the most effective when the best path is the Mukti here the God has created everything see Ramakrishna just he said and we find in the ghana mark how they do like this they say everything that has been created by God the route is on the top or the mullah other Chaka very peculiar tree the route is on the top and from there only everything has come what we see the stool of the gross word everything we can see we can dodge we can smell we can understand this is all gross but at the back of it there's a shook shma the subtle thing is there this is a subtle tea we can understand but we cannot see we cannot perceive and beyond that is it cause we are burning the coal and we're from the coal was created we're from the coal came majority of the people who are utilizing using the coal they don't know but the scientists they know they'll be telling long long back maybe millions of years ago here was a huge forest and then it went down and then it was covered by art and for so many thousands of years now it has become the coal like these of these these the everything has been changed according to that now we do not know so Karen is there the calls is there because of the cause then comes the subtle effect and because the subtle effect the clothes effect it comes but beyond that there's a Maha karna Maha Karan Karan sukshma Tula the four steps why suddenly there was an earthquake only accident of all the places in the world why this place should have an earthquake why this whole vast land forest land will go under the art why then it will become a coal why these days soma ha karna is there we do not know that is called God's will ordinary people they'll be telling it's God's will why this I do not know swim to that way we save ourselves the gods will muhaha Karan something is there why i was born in india why you were born in there there there why mahalo is there we do not know we do not understand then there were koruna my karmic Allah then there is a sukshma subtle thing because of my past life I did something so I came in contact with the ideology of ceramic schnaa Vivekananda I felt good I understood it I liked it then afterwards I never knew how to become a monk then suddenly one person I met he said yes you can become wrong but these are the thing then so if you go through these there's a Maha karana God then the coroner the effect because something happened in my past lives then the Sh'ma karna my desire then this to LA coruna I am standing here so that we see only the two la corona but beyond that see Ramakrishna in his very simple way he he said one person all some people they were sitting in one place and they were drinking there is a bar then one percent the neighbor he came he tore can you please give me the one sip did okay he just took one shot as they call it and immediately became so much intoxicated fell down on the floor then all people are wondering what is it with only one shot but he's a known drunkard is not that is the first time he is doing drinking how come just one shot he too can fell down then other story you don't know yesterday whole night he was drinking this is the last one whole night he has drunk to that means only we see the effect and we judge on that no beyond there are so many other things at the earth the so many stories bhagavan sri ramakrishna is telling the maha karana that is brahman karna the cause the Sheik shmeh the subtle then the stool of the gross similarly in the vedantic terminology Toria is a super consciousness then Schoop t the dreamless sleep there was no dream and nothing no awakening are you sleeping but I can feel that I was sleeping sound sleep without disturbance even by the dream who is that who was remembering it consciousness that is called shoo-shoo t su shakti and that is a consciousness dreamless sleep and the condition of the mind is prob gia the knower only knowing then comes three jersey chaser means dream in that condition we are dreaming and in the dream we do everything as we do in the physical body that way we are feelin good you are feeling bad sometimes we are is agitated sometimes we are afraid so many things happen gets called to a gesture but consciousness is there then we show the universe the gross look at it how they have explained and then look at the individual person the body an individual soul fast is on nemiah this body but beyond this body there is a subtle mind mahamaya more subtle prana maya vital force without the prana we cannot survive then knowledge Big John Amaya we cannot understand that much about that and then finally on under Maya the free feeling of joy we feel joy so how subtle we go and that is we have to understand the more subtle we can become we can understand all this all the gross body all that we see is nothing you have to go further further far beyond and far beyond so that way only we can then afterwards the next day we will discuss about first is Brahman then comes bogof on then comes Avatara the Brahmin who becomes vagabond so that we can understand him then again the vagabond all so far away so we want someone is so close to us let's call Avatara the one American boy he has written to me I leave in such an such place I am now reading Vedanta I want to go to a person for discussion so there is no Center over here nearby see if there was one it could be very good so sometimes some people they want some personal guidance Avatara as a positive personal guidance they come the ball the lead the grow and all together just just like us and then suddenly we find my God he's so big so are so knowledgeable and so kind so powerful we look him just an ordinary person but now he's not so about that Avatara we will discuss in the next in a Bengal is Ramakrishna stealing avatar na holy provision mate not unless there is a vitara we don't get a satisfaction so that is the reason and the six quality supernatural qualities which will explain afterwards of the God that must be there if we have to tell him as a bond gianna isharya shakti bala veria teja these are the six supernatural qualities he must have we will discuss this is the next but only one sloka kuvira is a wonderful floka he said booty purple jaguar pundit bionic away the high akshar pre-emmy car / a soup onda guey so this is a wonderful way of expression the Kavir dodge was a very ordinary person he was a weaver he was a Muslim and low caste people never touched in those days the people never touched him and he wanted a guru and the Guru said I cannot give you initiation then the Muslim will be angry on me and there will be all those things they will come and blame me why you were converting Muslim into Hindu I cannot give you initiation here he was going on pursuing then one day he heard then that guru is explaining what is mantra if you get the name of God and then you concentrate your whole mind on that particular word of god or the name that is mantra and by that you can raise yourself the kuvira then he researched on the Guru ho early morning he goes to Ganga and most of the time it is Dirk you cannot see properly so he went and he lied down on one of the stare of the Ganga and then a kashi there are big staircases he was lying and the Guru wind inadvertently not knowing that person is seen lying over there he kept his leg on him touched him and the moment it touched immediately say dramarama covi got Evan said said I have got your blessings your touch and also from your mouth the name of God please bless me I like to do the Pasha he was so happy seeing the eagerness sincerity that kuvira became a great Saint in the medieval India he became a great Saint he is telling people are reading books books and books in the library now I am sitting and I seeing what all this book so if I could read so many different type of but you open you see the same thing and people are writing from here there and then putting a bus
