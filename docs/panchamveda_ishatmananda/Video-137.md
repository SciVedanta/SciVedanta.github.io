[138. Panchama Veda 138- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkOiLhqGETI)

you have heard by this time job you know that our most revered visiting Swamiji has passed away and lost 18 so may I request you to stand up and in one silence one minute silence we practice and brief to God please take your seat we believe that the president of the order representing Sri Ramakrishna that particular chair is the power of ceramic is not manifest to him we could read today what see Ramakrishna is telling and if you listen to a interview that was taken by a Bengali TV code and it is there in the Bengali TV a BP under budget Africa and I was wondering again and again when they are asking for different philosophical question he is in one point God can be seen in his living beings and when we go to Temple and worship the God over there in the images or in the picture can't we do the same thing in the living mean so so many times he repeated the same answer whatever the question is it dis and when they were he was asking the interviewer he said yes it is so difficult to do the relief work even there are chances that you die but what is there people will die today or tomorrow that's for sure even if you die when you are helping someone there's a great so that was his idea very bold idea he was a very courageous person I had long the memories of him exper very loving but some other time we will discuss about that but I am thinking that this on the 30th day 30th of this June there's a Friday I don't know how many of you will be able to come I don't know how many disciples of the Xiaomi is here at most one on the G so if anyone is there if you know and you can come over here we will have a special puja a little puja on 30th June and that is the 13th day that is usual system and as because he's a sannyasi there is no structure or anything just offering a special puja to tackle and if you want you can come and attain that puja and offer the flower to tackle on that particular tea maybe a little bit of Prashad in the fruit pressure and sweets so let us begin this Punjabi de the gospel of ceramic dish na pavakah Hamra tum top the G vanam go vvv rhythm Calma sharp aha Savannah Mangalam three medalta Tom Kubik grinning de bourree dodging ah this is a wonderful way of expression that whoever is reading these words are hearing discussing all in the West last we were just talking about in our last class did about the Maya Raghavan C Ramakrishna he was talking about the Maya and then we coated the ramanujacharya Shankar Acharya how we have explained it and the Ramanuja for Ramanuja it is unreal this is real Ramanuja said Maya is eternal unconscious primal matter which is in Brahman and which is really transformed into the world so this is the point where Ramanuja and Shankar Acharya differ Advaita Vedanta and be she stood with evident and Shankar Acharya says no to the completely completely different and Shankracharya putting forward the be Berta bada and parinamavada ramanuja is supporting parinamavada complete transformation like the milk is transformed into yogurt and there is no chance for the other to become milk again because there from the milk it has come to us true but completely different shape it has take different form it has taken different qualities but for the Shankar Acharya he says no it cannot be because we can become gram money again we can go back to them and again we can go back to the source again then what is this so he says be berthed about the appearance is not the real transformation it is appearance how it is appearing so that classical example of the rope and the snake so it goes as reads the snake but it is not snake then what it is rope Brahman but we are thinking this is the world and when someone comes the guru comes the removes our ignorance darkness then we see that is the same room man as in the case of the rope and the snake someone is coming with the light the guru is coming with the light and then the person who was afraid you are seeing something else he sees the original thing but for the Sri Ramakrishna this is very interesting cinema Krishna says Maya is nothing but lost and gold desire so he is giving in a different way otherwise Sri Ramakrishna is very practical and he is actually teaching the very very ordinary people like Earth we understand that the worth of other foreign Amma vada is difficult this is all philosophical but any our day-to-day life what is our problem desire if there is no desire there is no problem most of the people nowadays they are talking about depression the young people going into depression why depression on finished or unsatisfied desire something was there I want to be like these I want to be like that people should behave like these people should like they're all desires are there it is not satisfied and I am not disclosing it to someone because of the ego and then ultimately what happens I win myself I go into depression there is a peculiar temper then I go and then they'll be therapy and all these things only because of that Saddam Oh Krishna is very practical instilling because of this last and gold and that is called the Maya Maya is nothing but the last end goal a man attains yoga when he has freed his mind from this - tomorrow is the international yoga day the 21st June and there naturally the it was under the leadership of the India this all the United Nations they took the decision all over the world people are following it but that Yoga is an utter yoga this is good good for the health and when the body is good and at the same time they are also teaching in that a little bit of meditation concentration concentrating your mind on these but majority of the mind goes on the body that is one part second part India developed along with the body mind and most praise has been given on mind because if the mind is not calm and composed your body may be it is very strong but it's going to stop this is all depends on the mind the stress has been given on the mind ceramic is new we have already read that utter yoga it takes our mind on the body so he is constantly stressing our mind that it should go up beyond this how he is telling because you have to make yourself free from all these desires lust and gold the Kama issue grows each in the bhagavata as sickish dimension and that is Maya Shankar Acharya says you cannot explain Maya it is such it is asserted is this it is that is so difficult sin a notational desire where from the desire came in the mind why because of these things too many varieties of things are there and I am desiring for that and after getting that suppose I get that I was I wanted to purchase a beautiful car very good car and after purchasing that what happened again another desire again and the d'azyr there is no limit of it so that is the reason they say desire is there and to satisfy the desire you want the wealth the goal that is the reason and when you have that again dissatisfaction so the root is desire give it up and that is Maya unnecessarily the desires are coming when I was a small young boy my desires were different and when is a grownup grownup young man desires a different and the middle age it desires are different old age desires are different old age or is the D the desires doctors could dr. Sudhir hereby so I will be there and when you are a young man and you are going to Marion to settle for da the house and all then in America the desire for a good school because I have to admit the children into the school so they go to that part of the area where there is good school and purchase that but somewhere house and so that live so all the desires are changing isn't it every day we are experiencing and that which is changing is a temporary so obviously that is Maya unnecessarily we are thinking in that way but we come to the point where see Ramakrishna will be explaining it more clearly and he is telling because of this desire one cannot see God only because of this why just like it clay he is giving that example as the clay is covering the needle the needle is supposed to be it is getting the pool of the magnet but cannot go to magnet cannot fill the pool God is giving the call come come come come but I am NOT hearing that call not feeling that call why because my mind is covered with the mud dust dirt what are those things desire the ceramic isne is giving the example it can draw the middle only when the clay is removed the plea of lust and gold must be removed now this is the dictum of ceramic which must be removed and slowly slowly slowly slowly when you we are proceeding towards the garden is so peaceful so joyful so happy people are suffering just because of loneliness people are suffering because I am not having anything to do who said there's so many things to do if you make a routine from the morning to the night you will find there is no time at all so many things to do you read the book you listen to the song and do the meditation who do the puja go out and help other people and you have so many things but we are not happy wife we want recognition we want the company of the other friends and relatives and all that but if you go on repeating the name of God and thinking that you are in that company so wonderful when you're walking thinking that you're walking with the mother much of the money Devi and mother is talking with you and you are going on giving of course not we come inside you're going on talking with the mother otaku are giving the the description of all those things mother Masaru demanded Amy after the passing away of Saddam Krishna wherever she used to visit used to carry the picture of Taku and from there secretly she used to take it out from the back and still show the Taku that photo see you have not visited this area I have come it's a beautiful area look as if she is doing first time the tacker is there taquerias present of this very much watching the feint tackle is there other people may say oh she or he has lost the balance mental balance look we are thinking in different way we are having the different talk he or she is thinking in a different way no you are the most sane person and ultimately you will enjoy not the others so that is what the Ramakrishna said in the mr. Mukherjee we every maybe he is asking how can one remove it as the question I always referred to some people say this is the book one should read when matured in spiritual life I did a beginner at this why because of the question answer all the questions are so practical just as if when I hear that because of the dirt because of the clay the middle is not getting the pull of the magnet natural question will be how to remove Saddam Oh Krishna is giving the answer and he is telling now he is talking about the yoga and meditation and see the varieties he says we forgot with a longing heart tear shade for him will wash away the play so easy close your right nostril and they take the breathe from the left nostril and then count and old and then so many things are there I will not like that anyone coming to us Sammy ji can you please teach meditation or the yoga and if we say just try for God they will leave not even paying a dollar as a donation he doesn't know you'll have to say sit in this position and then these and then that what is the purpose this is the christian purpose is to get the peace happiness if that is so the ceramic isne is giving the different type of meditation he said we forgot all don't be alone you are here looking at tackle and praying to tackle why these things are happening to be my friend is suffering mine there's a relative they are also crying and there so why can't you do something you are just praying to talk to so wonderful and do that and feel the lightness after the prayer when you get up all those tensions have already gone only one thing you need read that means listen to the world of cinema Krishna believe it and practice it all problems will be solved and he says that when you have dust freed yourself from the impurity you will be attracted by the magnet only then will you attain Yoga Yoga means union union with God your mind is going and you're not getting United and impurities what is the impurity desires that's why show me be vacant to say as a definition of God unselfishness is God God is nothing but the purity and purity is nothing but unselfishness I have nothing to say as I mine is all God so he is telling in this way McCarthy's killing priceless words he's appreciating it i enjoying under striding to understand it then if a man is able to weep for God he will see him this is called rishi ba ba kia up to vaakya after he had he himself as practiced that realized God those who have gone through the biography of the Rama Krishna the students of the life of Rama Krishna we all know how used to cry as to pray whenever give the evening approaching the Sun is setting he will be rubbing his face and then crying to mother mother today again one day is - from my life the Sun is setting means - from my life where Sun is rising means one more day going away from the total span of my life every day every moment whether we like it or not is going on taking us and that when we are praying - Taku cryptic mom that we are crying if a man is able to weep for God he will see him he will go into Samadhi look at it we talked about Samadhi the highest position of the yoga and to reach to Deir Ezzor all astanga-yoga we know the great Patanjali and Saddam addiction is so simple Samadhi means you are completely marked into that consciousness of and you forget your body forget your all surrounding and that is called Samadhi and a man achieves kumbhaka without any yoga exercise if he but weeps for God the next stage is the money - can you imagine how we have to cry with so much of sincerity when we are crying to God it's so much of sincerity the God you are there only hiding you have revealed yourself to so many why not to me they could hear they could talk to you why not me in Hindi they say hemay how come PA sometimes everything what is listenmi I am also your son I'm also your daughter we are also your children and naturally when I am crying how come being a father you are not coming to me so that is where see Ramakrishna stilling there is another myth or disease first devotion and in the devotion you never say that these are the mantras you have to Artur and then this is the Kriya first you take the water and then take three times o wish no ambition ambition then duty you don't do that then in the beginning is okay at the primary level but devotion means two things hundred person faith that God is there I don't know after scene I have not heard but as Salam o Krishna has said Jesus has saved but of course we didn't talk about God but that realisation of the knowledge the consciousness must be there is there God is there and in which form I don't know easy as a goddess Kali in the mother form or as a Sheba or just consciousness I don't know I don't bother to know only the faith is God is there and I believe in the words of Sri Ramakrishna and I cry cry sincerely opening my heart I cry for so many things and I must cry for God reveal reveal reveal reveal sometimes even if you try to cry you won't be able to cry and if somebody says and this is the problem that you are going to face then the tears will roll down but for God try to cry no it's very very difficult to cry for God why there are so many other desires are there and on the top of it there is no failed a little bit of faith is there a let me try if it is there so that doubts will be there but complete hundred-percent faith God is the error I am crying so this is the yoga there is another method meditation in the sastra the scripture shiva manifest himself isn't under the same the aspiring should meditate on him the body is like a tree now he is giving an example and the Sheba is giving that Tantra and he stirring the aspirin should meditate on the theme I went to Toronto and there was a retreat and the retreat one and one took combination and in the month of kupuna she's very smallest Upanishads only at 12 local and dear they say this is Brahman and the Brahman is becoming everything how through by Shannara and you should meditate how on Brahmin he is having is aid on the sky and the Sun is his eye and these and these and these you are transforming yourself into that huge God in the pollution shifter the Rigveda it says that this is the God if you are meditating on that slowly you are breaking the small limit of the body and I consciousness I and me it is breaking you're reaching to that and the puja is before starting any Hindu they'll be telling ohm Vishnu Vishnu on vishna and then slowly thinking that I am becoming purified why how we are becoming purified let's drop of water maybe Ganges water a pure water that you are sleeping and becoming purified I am becoming ditional that's why I am purified how I am becoming vishnu be sorry vishna they say beasts are everywhere and I am everywhere I am become the Vishnu and if you cannot think yourself as that you are everywhere at least we can imagine Shankar chapter kadar Padma dari are the beautiful which Vishnu is standing over there he is the creator he is the sustainer and everything goes back to him I am that that means you are going beyond that small limitation of re and which is connected with this body so obviously there is no desire for anything when you don't have that high consciousness you are pure that very moment and after because becoming pure you're worshiping the purity that is God so this is the way here in the yoga and you are thinking body is like a tree is giving the example and the mind and body are like water son of satchitananda 30 on under which is the closest way of expressing about Brahman the moment we say Brahman is satchitananda it is limited again it cannot be government is not searched on under we are trying to go near to the Brahman by telling it is like this if you say what is milk somebody asked he has not seen milk never tasted if it is white it's like liquid like the water but white and very tasty very healthy he will get a conception about it but he will may well know what is milk and unless and until he is drinking it himself so similarly here it says succeed on under such cheap on under this is the existence knowledge and bliss eternal so that way we can develop a conception about it it never changes it is the knowledge so that way we are thinking it is reflected on the water where it will be on the mind so meditating on the reflected Sun one sees the real song through the grace of God and here also we are imagining that I am becoming the Vishnu those who are meditating on bhagavata-dharma krishna after doing the Jabba the career then slowly meditating the last part of it I am transformed into that God and they're born wonderful transformation I am transform a sphere Amma dish now when I try to see God outside where is God it is here we didn't mean and when I look at me oh no it is me only that is God so that is called from the devotion I give go to knowledge and here again see Ramakrishna said stealing but the worldly man must constantly leave in the company of all email he mentioned but the worldly man must constantly leave in the company of holy main the next line he is mentioning it is necessary for all even for the son Yaffe the ones I have got to give you a cloth and I am now jagadguru to one of us Swamiji he was very fond of giving some advices to others but but secretly used to give what is it quickly go and give the advice before everyone because you are Jerrod guru but when you are giving that rice is only coat from Sri Lanka so that's all don't give your own views that would be difficult there never hide you have every right to give God you have to coat and when you are quoting when you are reading each and every sannyasi in our order the great Swami's every day they read the gospel particularly our devotees long-standing devotees each and every one before going to bed they will be reading the gospel at least one or two pages that is called holy company and that way each and every one not only the mastic that those who have left the heart and home also those who are living in the houses the householders they should also get this company why what is the holy company inspiration constantly having is not that you have to go to someone and sit with him all the time no it's not necessary when I joined this order as a I went as a young man to that chair upon G and the Swami in charge he was trying to hide I don't come out one Xiaomi is coming from builder mode don't come out before him at all context see him not from distance they don't come out and he never allowed me to cut the hay yes also so that when he was shaving the hair and all naturally you can recognize did it be afterwards afterwards afterwards I understood what he said that he wanted to hide me from him and the Swami who came at McDonald and used to after force us to call him as the tiger show me and he came before reaching he got all the information a one new boy has come over here where is he no no no no never he is deciding he is not yet decided that decision he will take when in better what I'm going to take him and naturally the Swami told no no they really need so hands and when you're working you need the hands that good today he liked me I also wanted to be there but the Xiaomi brought me over here in the middle mark I was in bed with mark and other xiaomi is also over there so in the bezel mode that atmosphere early morning you have to get up and go to the temple everyone is meditating you will never be able to see the faces because so much of mosquitoes all are covering their aids and the Mongol are tea and then everywhere the Brahma cherries and the monks are sitting and meditating that inspires you you cannot fit anywhere I mean sleep anywhere oh I'll go and lie down normally you get the inspiration sadhu sanga then all that talk about this so many times we are to read different type of books sometimes in groups sometimes the senior Swami's constantly then now I understood that it is so beneficial to be the Builder mod in the small asteroid chair upon G the Swami who has come he was in charge over there I only joined and that to fall may be hardly one year I goes there and just the knowledge so that Muslim Andrea understood he should not be here that was a great poem for me another Swami was there afterwards he became the president Xiaomi gone and Ambaji he saw me I will tell you some funny story about Joey about the game how I made that I never saw the Ramakrishnan Xiaomi I never knew how they are so when I joined in the chair upon G the crummy goblin and the day I knew him only so he is the only show me I saw and Shanta Lupin and the G II was our second show me I miss to show me they do bought so many Swami's I never knew then I had one I was doing some work I was to make a gate before the Ramakrishna celebration the ocular on the T the insurers asked me to do that the people who were helping me as because the evening was approaching they have already played without completing and I saw it must have to complete otherwise next day morning they'll be precession and what to do ultimately I climbed on that no one was helping I went over there I kept some nails over in the pocket and I was taking out the hammer and nailing the clothes and of that way it was painting all and naturally I got exhausted suddenly one car came and stopped and the window screen went down and one gentleman and he was asking hey what you are doing over here you know that just joined fresh from the college so I could not restrain my death exhaustion which turned into it anger I don't know I am marketing over here so can't you see that I am working and mailing I am marketing at all and then I was going on thinking of what type of person is not helping he could get down and help me at least now he is asking her next in the evening after the prayer I saw Gokul on GT something gianna dr. Graeme Jenkins were there they're all busy and what happened to one senior Schwalm even below mode has come I was curious to see a senior swami little after the night food and everytime the moment I was in when I will see him when I will see him after the night food when he when he was sitting at his death man but oh my god he's here so naturally I was trying to hide myself but he called me a why you have joined the ramakrishna mission I told meditation of course I am NOT very much serious I saw the one premature is the first he asked what why you have come to Ramakrishna mission he said for jhana yoga I went to practice gana next to eat old poppy then I told bhakti gana is overbooked is over what left so I told the meditation jhana yoga asana yoga very good but true Karma he mentioned at every moment I was telling that now he will be telling about that incidentally and the game joschwa me will scold me he never mentioned and in my foolishness I thought yes forgotten could be recognized the next early morning he was living for Shillong that the capital city so we all were standing over there as is the other system and they were giving the joy I took God and all that I was in the front so I was doing like this when it was over just the car is started moving he again he looked at me and said could you complete that I understood he was remembering he recognized me but he never mentioned it before others to embarrass me so that impressed I met him individual mud he told gone analogy rain ever embezzlement don't waste time the more you become senior the more the responsibility will come and you will never get the opportunity to meditate because a lot of what you have do so now every moment meditate sadhu sanga so that inspiration that give me the three months of four months I was there that is so wonderful utmost analogy after the ninth food in the nine o'clock who is to take the food and come 9:30 to 10:00 half an hour used to call spiritual order that the means Association so spiritual and used to ask them any blue maggiore to seeing and the discussion a little reading and the leg pulling also a little bit of these and that and I was very strong and another grow mature us lean and team at McDonald's instituted a you lift him up and shake and then he will become like you each and every Brahma change should be strong powerful courageous why are you sitting like this that is not religious way she was always like that I remember him every time when I was seeing this it was remembering him so this that we we have learned sadhu sanga solution gisado Sangha it's not a person's company but the company of God here he is mentioning even the nation suit also then he says give God the power of attorney let him do whatever he wants can you imagine how much courage is made and it means I am giving everything at your hand I am not bothering for anything whatever happens is okay the power of attorney I believe that this person is going to do perfectly for me and I give all my responsible to him and I am free he is taking decisions on my behalf so here I am giving the responsibility to God so the third state self surrendered and we find in the hurry bhakti bilasa it says like this uh Nicole gesture sankalpa I am going to be with you Oh God uh Nicole India I am going to get the grace of you the grace of yours and I am going to be with you particularly bieber jonah anything against that I am going to give up Raksha sir et puis shoe also he will protect me I am completely like Xiaomi be beggin the same don't worry about me the power that is protecting me is much higher power than anything above and below son I could not quote the exact words but that we the complete shake when the other young Swami's Brahma Colleen's there in Bell is not the formation time so many different type of thought currents and the pull of the family members they were all young confused what to do and what not to do this young man of twenty two twenty three not in the north Ramakrishnan is to call him as the hero bill teeth of ev'ry and he said what do you think we have seen God we have served God everything is going to be alright have faith faith and faith and he's a rock Shashi eating vishwas oh and in one of the slokas asked is located Ramakrishna dasa I am me we are the servants of ceramic ish now we can even if necessary we can eat the star choose the star what do you think tremendous power manifesting because we belong to see the location what is problem so DC is the tremendous feed Russia ET wish wasa the one boy sometimes the ring me and is asking for help a little bit of problems I always say no one can help you except God have faith and go and demand that from God you must protect me you have created me you are my father I have 100% belief and you must protect me Raksha CEP wish you also and go go Tito barnum data and with a positive ID lay up to wait otherwise doctrine 12 means waiting patience I call God I pray four times then nothing has happened is not like that you have to wait wait and wait and see then only slowly slowly when the transformation will come you don't know when the transformation is coming someone acts Marcia Rosa Munni Devi ma we are going on calling on God meditating taking the name of God nothing is happening mother to who say when you are sleeping suppose and some people come and lift you and carry you somewhere else and leave you over there you will lift it unconsciously and when you get up or I was in my room who brought me over here like that when we are taking the name of God slowly the transformation is taking shape all these things are happening but we are not very much aware so that is the idea so here he says there in the reducti balagia shall bid our Shore in order to eat then again and again we have to remember the Serrano Krishna is mentioning mr. Mukherjee and his friend left the room in thought Ami's the master measure the recorder according to the bed anta all this is dream vedanta means Advaita Vedanta the Vedanta has three stages Vita vicious Teresa and advaita master mache just he is mentioning the the Advaita Vedanta is nothing but dream all of these the ego the universe and the living being unreal then the nature it is so difficult to realize that this is unreal when I am pinching and feeling pain how can I say that I am NOT here I am unreal it's so difficult there is one way of practical experience so para martica satya babu hurry Cosette here there are two different things one is param articles appear a little boy playing with all others but the senior people are paying respect to the little boy not disturbing him playing with other children and he is behaving just like the other children the naughty boy he is taking these he is breaking these and all this they are also you know why they are doing it caring for him guiding him he is the future king is the son of king they know it because of but the boy is not aware he is hiding behind the throne of the King just playing like that and then one day he himself becomes the king like that one young Brahma Jerry was sitting somewhere and the elderly lady in the mother's place she was going not very much careful and the young brahmana is sitting so she was going are part of the cloth touch the body of the Brahma Jerry mother never liked it and she said do you see that the small boy but he's also Cobra because Cobra means is not the venom but he is going to be a sannyasi you do not know when this utmost Ananda G he told on bad he used to throw stone to the Shan mommy's fun these days to play in the Swami's are passing and a little bit of disturbances because they are playing on the street you know in our country and the Xiaomi is going with many others so he used to throw the stones in a playful way but then afterwards he himself became a Swami and if you hear that conversation it is so wonderful the one famous Swami was there when he is a very brilliant student is to study in the Presidency College and all they inspired him to complete his master's he was he joined the University Calcutta University but this Xiaomi told no there is not much time for you you must join don't bother about that but certificate from the University don't need that and when it is going on like that first year second year third year then that Xiaomi lost the patience and one day he baked him nicely that young boy has to go and you say if you are not listening my words I will kill you over here he physically rate him he was mentioning Daini decided layer ladies okay since they Xiaomi is living like this and he was a-doing Xiaomi so and so he went and took the bath in the Ganga decided joined now he became the president of ramakrishna mission so this way the shadow shunga and Mukherjee and other friends they are leaving him is thinking in this afterwards we find that see Ramakrishna he's talking him has raised some of the philosophies mentioning over here a man had studied the Vedanta and also read the German philosophers such as Kant and Hegel so then cinema Krishna did not arrived at his conclusions by reasoning as do scholars it was the divine mother of the universe who revealed the truth to him these were the thoughts that passed the mind of aim the great devotee so he was not thinking the negative way he was thinking see he is not giving any reason one young boy came he is a very nice story and he is now completing his the research worth his market-day degree and he came all these pedantic conclusions that you say these are faith right there is no reason behind it and no reason behind or say so I gave the reason why we say we are consciousness then I was explaining him the waking stage dream stage and then beyond the dream stage something is there because when our mind goes into that where my body is not present mind is not present because it is not dreaming but I come back and say oh I sleep so nicely who was present who came back and reported consciousness if this is not risen then what is the reasoning so this way Sadam Krishna is not going for the reasoning explaining and all that he is giving the dictum one Rishi he declared ishavasya me some sarvam he didn't give any reason why I am Telling You shava saddam's Arum afterwards the philosopher scheme and then the gives the reason because he was perhaps he was thinking in this way so these and these and these and these but the Rishi's that's why the beta the all Hindus they believed the beta has not been written by any human being it was revealed of pollution the Vedas are known as a pollution why the off pollution pollution is not the male or female the human being no human being created it how it was revealed in the mind of those holy people holy mind what is the mind again there is no desire and when there is no desire what happens to that mind calm and composed show me the vehicle is giving that example is like the pond the water water is tranquil very clear you can see the bottom of the pond even but the moment there is a some air passing yell started blowing then there will be ripple the strong wind then there will be the waves that that here that the wing our desires if the no desire what happened to that mind it is there tranquil and then we can see the bottom of it and then we reveal oh my god what I am searching outside it is here there's a beautiful story someone forward it you know the nowadays some people they likely something and they'll be forwarding and if you are liking the story send it to eleven people why I don't know but anyway I like that why because someone he lost his wristwatch and is not getting and he searched his then the haze where there is was a bomb so he was thinking how to find him there some young people were playing over the Aryan boys it array anyone of you find it and I will give you this this thing and then all they went and they were shouting and they searching no one could do it all came out and said sorry we can find it then one young boy he is then said we do give me another chance to go and search it why not go the boys went alone and after some time he took it out I found it but how come I'm happy that you got it but how it was possible I was searching they were searching one could do name the boy said it was all quiet inside the barn and I sat over there concentrated my mind of the tittle science sound of the watch and I found that sound is coming from this way I went and found it so the conclusion is if your mind is calm and composed you do much of work and become successful in many things then in how we are going to do these and that no so that is the idea be the evolution so I am the gosh in the AMA Krishna's heart it was revealed a little lattice the ramakrishnan team were conversing on the porch of ways of the Masters room no one else were there it was late winter afternoon and the Sun had not yet gone below the horizon the wonderful description into three lines as if you close your eyes and you can transport yourself over there and can see the whole thing which is happening in is the world unreal master Mercia just like us naturally confused what is unreal how it is possible we are doing everything at the same time we are telling I myself is not convinced in how I can accept it something else offers are giving this example these are there that may be but whatever then the answer of our master the great master as they say Sudama Krishna what is that why should it be unreal look at it what you are asking is a matter for philosophical discussion we conclude over here we will go to that maybe a little bit of philosophical discussion and the conclusion of ceramic this is the stationary sometimes people they compare with the RAM RAM see Ramakrishna with many other people know the in the interview that our the Xiaomi ji at Moscone on the Jews today he is about all over Easter you are sitting like a king you are sitting like a king and then giving the answer they sell what is European he is over thought over Easter and he says this the world whatever you see is nothing but the manifestation of the same God then why go again and again to the temple go out and help the people you will get the same blessings of God what you are expecting to gain by worship and the bold words what Swamiji say thank you friends that the next day again we will discuss about it and I am NOT introducing right now officially of course with the schwa mishima notion and the G because he will be going on Friday to give that retreat over there on the yoga's of Shama Vivekananda and if I introduce him over here you won't go off so I am expecting you all of you to go and then listen to him talk to him had a lot of experience and this is a very very simple swami so not like me so even really like see ya no problem she never wanted to change his religion he wanted to taste the path that the Muslims they are following the Serrano Krishna after realizing God from all the different paths of the Hindus including 64 different ways of the Tundra's then he was interested and when even the upgrade then they went to the divine mother and said ma I want to know how the others are calling on you praying to you realizing you then the mala became and he received that mantra and then he really practiced in the way of the Muslim he was wearing the dress just like him scream you an investment he was praying that the one tree is still there under it he prayed but he never said that I want to convert myself in twists but he said that was his mind what ever used to do under Putin so if I had to realize the Allah or to understand their path whatever you do I will do so that is the main thing oh no he was very much he was not asking he's then why he practiced all those even the Hindu in the way why he worshiped the Kali he was God himself the God came in the form of a human being why the God then suffered in cancer why the God is to go to house to house to inspire being to realize God
