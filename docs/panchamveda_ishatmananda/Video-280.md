[281. Panchama Veda 281 : God's Birthday Celebration Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2Ov_IEx900)

namaskar this wednesday evening we'll be studying the gospel of sri ramakrishna panchama veda let us begin with we were reading that particular chapter the master's birthday the 696 page of the gospel of sirama krishna that master is singing this very world is a mation of marth here i can eat here drink and make mary before that say when the master was the other other people narendra was singing let us read from there the master himself will also sing but the now narendra is singing master used to love bhagavan's ramakrishna to love to listen to narendra and narendra is singing in danes darkness oh mother thy formless beauty sparkles in bengal it is as narendra sang the line who are thou mother seated alone in the shrine of samadhi shi and immediately the sudama krishna went into deep samadhi and lost all outer consciousness after a long time when he was regaining partial consciousness the devotee seated him on the carpet and placed a plate of food before him now how graphically master masha has recorded now they are celebrating the birthday of sirama krishna how they are celebrating the celebration is only about the spiritual life spirituality god religion see that is unique they hear the moment he sang master went into deep samadhi what is this merging into that particular idea which was expressed through that song sang by the narendra not afterwards and he was in such a deep mood the people cooked food for him because they wanted to celebrate his birthday in the birthday food eating is the main but sudama krishna his level of mind went so high he forgot his body consciousness the little when he came down immediately they spreaded the carpet and requested him to see it and gave the plate of food still overcome with divine emotion he began to eat the rice with both hands see when a person for forgetting that he is a body what he will do so going to that samadhi that means forgetting the existence of this body that is the uniqueness so when we are meditating what we really try we try to forget our this body and mind they slowly slowly we go to that fourth stage which is consciousness in a vedanta they always try to explain that consciousness and how we will understand the consciousness then they say that you are awake your mind and body is working you are sleeping and dreaming your body is inactive mind is working and in the deep sleep your body and mind both are absent what remains there each and every one is experiences this con this particular condition dreamless sleep the jagrat and if we go beyond that in susuti we go with the ignorance mind is there but ignorant when we come back again we get up we say oh i had a wonderful sleep but that is a different when we take our mind slowly slowly up from the body or from the mind then we go to a place called consciousness and that the vedantic say chaturtham so that is chaturtham the fourth stage that is called turya now we find that so easy for from bhagavan si ramakrishna he's simply going to that condition the moment narendra nade sang that song oh mother who are you sitting in that in that you were alone in the samadhi mandira in that temple of meditation immediately the mind goes over there and he has come down externally but his mind and body is not yet tuned so when they offer food he started eating with both the hands because that body consciousness was not there still overcome with divine emotion he began to eat the rice with both hands he said to babanat feed me babu not a devotee because of his ecstatic mood he could not use his own right hand bhavanath began to feed him sirama krishna could eat very little ram said to him nitygopal will eat from your plate now the whole arrangement was for bhagavatam krishna and that it is his birthday and all that now he could not eat but this shows is constantly in that supreme mood but sometimes he used to come down but afterwards we will find how this person who forgot that it is his birthday the people are celebrating all the food that was arranged it is for him a very peculiar way in both the hands it took a little food because that practice was there we have to eat so which hand should be used he couldn't understand so with both the hands he was eating then ultimately someone helped him to eat but that also could not much then he said the nittogopal will eat from your plate why from my plate because he was wondering is my plate who is going to eat from my plate like that but the ram could not understand perhaps why not he said it's not that sirama krishna is telling the why that person should eat from my plate he was not recognizing so we can understand those who practice meditation sometimes someday when the mind becomes truly very calm and composed when it goes to that the consciousness when you come back slowly maybe for a minute or two so not like bhagavan sirama krishna but even then when you come back from the meditation we can understand we are not many people they don't like to talk when they're walking maybe not properly stepping so that is the time when ordinary people like us can experience that think about bhagavan sirama krishna nityagupal was also in an ecstatic mood master put a morsel or two in his mouth with his own hand the sudama krishna could recognize who is in a high spiritual mood this is ramakrishna himself in his own hand he is feeding the nit nitto gopal think of the blessedness of that person but the god he is there in the human form of krishna people are gathered were there to celebrate his birthday and god is blessing them by this way some devotee from konnagar arrived by boat they entered sirama krishna's room singing kirtan afterwards they went out to take some refreshment narutom was in the room the master said to him and the other devotees the music of the konnagar devotee was dull music should be so lively as to make everyone dance one should sing a song like this the srama krishna he was in a static mood but the other people who they came from another place called kunagar so when they were singing master didn't like that song because he didn't feel that spiritual upsurge so that's why he was mentioning like this the the music of the konnagor devotee was dull music should be so lively as to make everyone dance then he was singing see how all nadia is shaking under the waves of guranga's love there's a beautiful song not the tallow talo curry hillary as he had a very fair complex so this to call gore so goranga anger the body goura means fear complex the goranga so he has come then another song he is mentioning here behold the two brothers have come who weep while chanting hari's name the brothers who in return for etc that song and one of our swamiji he sings this song very well it must be in the youtube sometimes you can listen to it that wonderful song is a beautiful rhythm and it gives the meaning also the wonderfully what the two brothers do do means two bhai means brothers who are they they're actually brothers mentioned spiritually spiritual brothers but that is goranga and nityananda these are the two so nityananda and guranga they they consider as if the two brothers they were so close the nithyananda he was he was a householder he lived in a householder's life and he used to teach this the spirituality religion living in the householder's life because caitanya mahaprabhu asked him to leave in the there otherwise the householders will start thinking that everyone should become a monk because caitanya mahaprabhu said no it is not for everyone because it is up to some people may become monkey they are having that aptitude the strong desire to be free that is okay but not for all but all people should practice religion so these two one was representing the sannyasi another the householder but they were too very close the gauranga and nithyananda so they have come and that song if you can listen is really really very good jade the prasad it was a sumptuous feast sri ramakrishna said to him haven't you invited the mukherjees ask surendra to feed the musicians suryandra he was a rich man so he perhaps arranged this feast and some other people also the donation was collected from the householder devotees and they arranged the food also so people were eating master was now inquiring about and he was telling about the mukherjees and he was asking surendra to feed the musicians some of the bowels they came so they should then the beeping shark arrived the devotees introduced him to the master suramar krishna sat up and said to the devotees give him a seat and some better leave he should after the food they they were eating some better leave so that was the custom that he told give him a seat so he can see it and we can talk and he said to bp in harmley i am sorry not to be able to talk to you there is a great crowd today look at it as a bhagavan sirama krishna but so kathy are so gentle and he was telling i am sorry not to be able to talk to you there is a great crowd today pointing to girindra srama krishna said to baburam friends this is very simple description but we can understand sirama krishna who goes into that samadhi that person is so very concerned for all the people who have gathered over there these are the signs of spirituality that they are very concerned for the people who are gathering who are coming talking to them attending them at least some attention given to them so this is because in the mahabharata it says the greatest religion is that to practice with the others those things which you expect from others so when you go to somebody's house in some place we want some attention like that so obviously if anybody is visiting our place we should also give them attention talk to them and to give whatever they need we should try to serve them so feeling for them that is the religion we are learning it from bhagavan si rama krishna pointing to girindra sirama krishna said to baburam giving me a carpet nityogupal was sitting on the floor the master asked a devotee to give him a carpet too why the master uh master mahasha the recorder why he is mentioning all this in details first thing to give a complete picture what is happening what sadama krishna is doing whatever the small little thing that he's saying and we can feel oh this is not a religious book that is like a diary he is mentioning all these things whereas spirituality see these are the spirituality because a concern for others again srama krishna who goes into samadhi he forgets his own body consciousness when he comes down to the this normal plane immediately he feels for others he knows what to do and what not to do these are the teachings to learn very simple but we forget to do that we think spirituality means i should not talk to others and i need not to take care of others whether they are eating food or not not like that one should be very very careful so these are the signs of growth of spirituality so i am just there i take my food and then i don't care whether the others are eaten or not i am a holy person krishna is not like that that's why i'm mentioning and reading this and mentioning this physician mahendra obsidi arrived the master smiling asked rakal by a sign to have the position examine his pulse the rakhal means our afterwards swami brahmanandaji he was there maybe he was not feeling well salaam krishna knew it the moment the physician has come the salama krishna and he was indicating by a sign why don't you go and talk to him the physician he will feel your pulse and can give you some medicine turning to ramallah the master said be friendly with giddish then you will get a free ticket to the theater so practical when a doctor has come he was asking a devotee rakhal maharaj to take that help of that physician and girish chandra ghosh obviously if you are not known to him how he will invite you to for the show and ramallah he was a nephew of srirama krishna he used to look after ramakrishna the salama krishna asking that girish knows me he will invite me i will go what what about you you have to go and talk to girish chandra gosh by this way he was making the introducing his own people narendra had been talking a long time with hajra on the porch since his father's death narendra had been having financial worries he entered the room and took a seat salam krishna noticed it the master to narendra vary with hajra both of you are in the same boat you know the saying about the two friends you are away from your country and he is away from his beloved the hajdra too needs fifteen hundred rupees because hazrat the hajdra mahashaya he is to sit just in front of krishna zoom there's an open big barranda so hazra is to sit over there and whoever is to come with all the great people the rich people this to come to bhagavan's ramakrishna is to take that opportunity to collect some donation for his own uh the loan that he took so that he can pay it back but directly people won't give to him so he used to talk to them like that now narendra as because he was also having some trouble after his father's death those who have read the biography of swami vivekandi you know that that was a very challenging time for the narendra the sirama krishna is not liking that narendra should behave like hajjra so jokingly he is cautioning him hazrat says narendra has acquired 100 percent shatwa though still there is in him a pink glow of rajas but i have 125 percent pure sattva so hazra is to announce like that so you can understand those who say like that there's a just hollow there's nothing much to uh to accept that everyone is laughing i say to hajra you indulge in reasoning only that is why you are so dry the dry because you know those who are following the path of reason path of knowledge and they apparently they are dry of course when we read about him the comments of bhagavan sirama krishna and also observed hazra's behavior we can understand the bookish knowledge he only used to read the books that he used to archer like the parrots not truly practicing pure advaitha that is a completely different thing suramar krishna understood that so he is just also telling the hajjra then hazra retorts no i am dry because i drink the nectar of the sun sun means the knowledge so i nectar of the knowledge so i am dry surama krishna mentioning that too because could not become humble before sudama krishna he used to live with god leaving god even then sometimes he used to oh you must be god i wonder who are you sometimes used to say azra but majority of the time because of his ego i know i read all the scriptures ramakrishna can't read he has not read the scripture so he is not any match with me he used to think like that see sometimes we think that had we been in the company of bhagavatam krishna but if you have the ego then even the company of sudama krishna can't help you the duryodhana was also having the company of bhagavan sri krishna the lord krishna the god himself arjuna and pandavas they were blessed they understood him but the other brothers the durjudana and his brothers they couldn't understand that so this that means even the god if the god is also living with us we won't be able to understand that or take the benefit of his company or the company of a holy man if we if we have the ego so obviously these are the teachings that we are learning from this ramakrishna speaking of pure bhakti i say to hajjra a real devotee does not pray to god for money or reaches hajjar replies the hazrat won't leave so why he's replying that's not mentioning to the devotees that these this way the hajja is looking at him he is not understanding bhagavan si rama krishna hasra said a real devotee at the azad to hajj he said hazrat replied when the flood of divine grace descends the rivers overflow and further the pools and the canals are filled by the grace of god one gets not only pure devotion but also the six supernatural powers and money too so hazra was thinking in that way how one will understand that he has progressed in the spiritual life he will have the supernatural power and he will have the money he will have the name fame appreciation from the people then only you can understand but it is really not like that so that is hazra living with suramar krishna reading the scripture but idea was not clear that is surama krishna is mentioning so that we can understand comparing with this even living with the holy person if you don't have the clear idea you are reaching nowhere and you won't have the clear idea unless you remove your ego the surama krishna is mentioning like this then the narendra and many other devotees were seated on the floor girish entered the room and joined them mastered to girish i look on narendra as atman i obey him so he was that talking to narendra that you go to hajdra you are like this narendra used to jokingly say is my friend though ferendo friend with ferendo there's a jokingly now suramar krishna he is telling to our girish chandra ghosh see he is narendra i look up on narendra as atman i obey him the girish jokingly is telling is there anyone you don't obey this shows the humbleness of bhagavan si ramakrishna the girish is telling is there anyone that you are not obeying master smiling he is a noble soul and belong to the realm of the indivisible brahman he means the narendra see how the rama krishna could recognize even a young man like narendra he could understand he is no other than the brahman himself girish went out to have a smoke narendra to the master i had to talk with girish gosh he is indeed a great man we talked about you master what did you say about me narendra that you are illiterate and we are scholars is jokingly is telling oh we talked in that vein and in laughter so narendra just in a different way he is mentioning that you're illiterate you have not read books you never attended school so and we are all scholars and then they had nice laugh money monthly to the master you have become a pandit without reading a book see the master is god himself but so simple so humble the ordinary people also could say all these things to him so that is just like a child they love him so much respect him so much but at the same time they were not afraid to talk to him sometimes of course he had a great personality but at the same time he was so simple as if just like a child sometimes we'll be having some fun with the children telling them different things not that we don't love them we love them but that is the fun with srama krishna also as narendra is telling then mani malik also the master to narendra and others let me tell you these really and truly i don't feel sorry in the list that i haven't read the vedanta or the other scriptures now he is telling this that they are just joking but they should not take it very seriously because vedanta is nothing but the knowledge and that knowledge comes directly from the self the atman the brahman so that is the knowledge of the self sirama krishna now indicating that he is none other than that atman who has taken a human form through the power of his own power that is maya maya shakti he is mentioning i am not this really and truly i don't feel sorry in the list that i haven't read the vedanta or the other scriptures i know that the essence of the vedanta is that brahman alone is real and the world illusory the people are going on reading books talking about this vedanta sudama krishna took the gist of it and then he lived the life so that is very very important human life is short so if we go on reading books scriptures no end to it even the shankaracharya he also said shabda jalam maharanam it's like a great forest a huge forest shalom of the words forest awards so many different ways the people will be talking weaver has read few books having little control over the language immediately will write a book and then he will paste it and another people person will read it like that constantly so many people but what is there in the vedanta sirama krishna very categorically very simple way he is mentioning that brahma jagat mitta that is exactly what the shankaracharya says sankaracharya also the great pandit he wrote so many commentaries and so many other scriptures also but still he said i can tell you in a halfway slope not even a complete slog what has been declared in the thousands of scriptures that they discussed about that in a happiest look i can tell that what is that brahma that truth the eternal is only brahman and this universe that you see are very temporary so it is mithya jiva brahmana opera and the jiba this individual self is nothing but that brahman so this is the way he mentioned and what is the essence of the gita it is gita teaches us to give up dyagi which refers to renunciation people should hear the essence of the scripture from the guru then he should practice austerity and devotions so this is exactly what ramakrishna wants to learn so we should learn these time is short we do not know when we are going to die and if we go on reading books and comparing books and this religion this that religion this philosophy that philosophy and go on comparing so when we will realize it that is why he is mentioning in this way that we should listen the gist from the guru about the sastras and then we should plunge into practice what is that practice what is mithya temporary now i am so attached to this body and the body means ego and then comes me and mine and this world and oh this from this society i am so and so i am this and that so by that way slowly slowly we get attached to so many things but we forget suddenly if i die what is going to happen to those things i keep the bank account and secretly i don't disclose it to anyone the huge money is there god weed suppose something happened to you suppose some you die in accident what will happen to that money it will go to those people whom you never knew that is the reason one should understand so i do not know when i'm going to die whatever is necessary for me okay now i am 50 years old i consider the another 50 years i will survive how much money even i need and by that way i can save that much of money and then it is okay for me so many buildings costly buildings in different places and what is going to happen to that i'm not going to leave in all those buildings maybe every three months if i go and stay for 15 days or one month then go to another how that way i can enjoy it is not possible i really need a little thing very small that humble way i can survive but i can help people that is exactly cerama krishna has come to that and he is teaching us that he's telling the girish again entered into the room master to girish hello what are you saying about me i eat drink and make merry at the narendra referred that we were talking the girish and me narendra and girish and girish is a great soul why because he was supporting sirama krishna this is two the devotees that from the beginning when the sudama krishna was alive that two of them they were going on telling to the world the surama krishna is leaving god the girish also so suramar krishna asked him here this girish is telling what should we have been saying about you are you a holy man he is just joking are you a holy man that we should talk about you you are god the goodies didn't say but he mentioned like this are you a holy man then master no nothing of the sort truly i don't feel i am a holy man girish i am not your equal even in joking the girish was joking are you a holy man that i will be talking we will be talking about you who are you sudama krishna immediately said i am not a holy man i don't think like that girish is mentioning that i am not equal even in joking that means sudama krishnameni mentioned i am not a holy man the kirish took it as a joke in reality he was god himself friends we can understand how the god when he is mixing with the devotees talking with the devotees how simple how humble he is and then master is telling i once went to joy gopal saints garden house wearing a red border cloth kesha was there looking at the red borders keshav said what's this such a flash of color today such a display of red borders i said i have to cast a spell on kesha hence this display that means sirama krishna keshav and was joking so he was so simple the people could have this type of the jokes also with him god but he is so simple why because there is no ego so this is the way suramar krishna is to behave narendra was going to sing again krishna asked aim to take down the tanpura as a type of the musical instrument from the wall narendra was a long time tuning it the master and the devotees became impatient binod said he will tune it today and sing another day all they were laughing there's a nice party was going on and sudama krishna said saddam krishna laughed and then he said i feel like breaking the tanpura to pieces what is this only tong tong then he will practice then he will sing so the ramakrishna is saying like this then the bravonath everybody feels annoyed like this before a musical performance begins musical performance means is a classical music there are the two different parts in the beginning that's called alap in the alab those who understand the grammar of that music they know how the singer is going to place that song and what are the the particular tune he is going to touch so same word same line you'll be singing in two three four different way that is the the specialty but those who don't understand for them it is really a torture because they don't understand what they say when there is a as a rhythm they understand they read them so that's why suramar krishna was telling and bhavanar said narendra still tuning he never cared what they are discussing he was going on tuning and he said if you don't understand it sirama krishna there he explains away our complaints narendra began to sing krishna was seated on the small couch nityagupal and other devotees were on the floor narendra sang see when we are reading we are almost transported to that particular time and place the sudama krishna enjoying the company of the devotees and devotees are enjoying the company of a holy person he is just like a child is so simple though he is god himself so they were celebrating god's birthday and that not that only the dry discussion but at the same time jokes and the a lot of laughter now narendra is singing and when he's singing he said oh mother thou my inner guide ever awake within my heart he was going on singing the different songs and in the ecstatic mood see rama krishna came down and sat by narendra's side and began to talk still in ecstasy just now the person he was joking oh now today he is going to tune and then maybe tomorrow he will sing like that things were going on but now i find the moment the narendra is singing he's singing not to please the listeners he was singing as a prayer each and every word of the song was pouring out going out as if to that the the heaven with the music the wonderful tune sirama krishna because the every song that is indicating the god the mother means the divine aspect of the god sudama krishna is that himself so obviously when a devotee the narendra not the pure-hearted pure soul person is singing and singing with all devotion and that song became the prayer what will happen to the god god comes down so he comes down and he's sitting by his side and talking with him friends i feel that is the way we should sing when you are singing before the god that is the way we should pray so the god should come down from his heavenly seat and he will be with me he'll be sitting by my side so this is the wonderful description what happens when we truly pray it's not the song it's the prayer and when you truly pray what happened god comes comes to us and he sees and he listens we should think like that the master shall i sing fight tunity gopal what do you say one should listen to singing to awaken the inner spirit nothing matters afterwards he has kindled the fire that is nice now all is silence that is nice too i'm silent you'll be silent too the things is to be driven into the elixir of please it is not the ordinary song it is the prayer and when we sing that's why i always try to attain the evening prayer that swami vivekananda composed for bhagavan si ramakrishna khan dhana bhabha bandhana bandana each and every word is so beautiful meaning and the very fast line very fast word oh lord please break all these bondages so that i can get the liberation every evening if we can listen to this song and can take our mind with the meaning of each and every word of the song then obviously god will come down and he will see it as he was sitting by the side of narendra so this is the way we should sing and sudama krishna said what happens after this prayer we become silent silent means there is no craving there is no desire and we become completely still the mind is not having any other thought but the god and that is the time when one get the all bleach as in the vedanta they say jagrat sapna susupti and turiya abbastha what is that is that silent there is no prayer there is no song there is no movement there is no desire everything is silent and that is the most blissful time blissful that is where we should go that is our goal thank you friends thank you today i think that we could not make is a live stream today but it will be in the youtube because of some difficulty so we could not organize it we couldn't do it this is the first time i think please bear with us we are trying to but you know the machines are always like that it is not all the time under our control the me bhagavan sirama krishna bless you all and bless us all also let me conclude with this pranam mantra niranjanam nityam anantharupam bhakta [Music] [Music] namaste
