[188: Panchama Veda 188: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna: How to Attain Blissful State Of Mind?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjFGqCoqXQ)

[Music] even Kobe very little calm shavon shavon among the lung Sri Madhavi Tata we'll be naughty bulid our general this is the last class of this year 2018 and here we will listen how saddam krishna is mixing up the path of devotion the part that knowledge the path of Keanu all paths are coming together he's just mentioning about it no we were the advice to the party Shoshana but it means the Sanskrit scholar so they a master in that our structure the Veda to talk to them is not there so easy and that to talking about the spirituality because they have started so much they know so many things and who is talking with this Sri Lanka who never attended any school and sadhana Schnur is giving him the answer it rests in the last day I mean in the previous class what kind of tea the one realized God through one what kind of tea that was the christian devotion what kind of devotion that one can realize God today he is asking what kind of yearning is necessary to realize the blizzard Brahma he was asking about the God realization now asking about the realization of the brahman after is a different but good one is called as a brahmana named darkness Brahman another as God we have heard what's around us to say about the God and about the Brahmans this Brahman when he is asking this question this is purely a pedantic end credits so obviously is not asking about the God not asking about the heaven but asking about the police are Brahman there they are asking this what kind of yearning gives one his this blissful State of Mind blissful state of mind that means that completely masked in the jar the blissfulness which is Brahman now this is a purely by radical provigil environment particularly the monastic Vedanta it means the threefold criterion of truth the truth is there and to reach to the truth there are only three steps in bonanza for the first would you have to explain you have to understand you have to get completely free in your mind in your thoughts that what you are going to do what you are going to achieve what you are going to realize so the three stages first sees authority Authority is Rudy Suzy is the read about you and this beta the Shruti the authority what is this Authority why should we accept it as Authority because they have after Barker's what a part of Archaea the statements of the realized people so that is very very important it's not intellectually but after the realization that they have recorded they told it to their disciples disciples to their disciples he has the Hindu tradition they say it comes down from that game and then afterwards they recorded why in the beginning sometimes some people particularly the Western scholars they thought that they were not able to write there was no stem split that is completely wrong script was there very much but didn't allow the disciples to write it down why they should memorize remember it and to memorize to remember you need the complete attention when we give the mantra diksha traditionally the Buddhist will say do not write it down anywhere why the name of God they can write it into the problem now then it will become sad anyone can read anyone can just go to that no it is mine God's name I should remember and very alert even the million people the comments a genre gene give me the deeksha but I am so sorry a little bit confusion am I really depleting the right way that you say sometimes but they're highly diverted people they remember so many things why not this particular name because the attention is this sir the sleuthy the teacher used to teach those things to the disciples and celebrity disciples you should not forget it the complete attention completely memorization because the moment I do not understand don't memorize when teacher may not repeat it that's called routine after hearing and remembering not that there is no street there is a wrong conception very much it was there afterwards the more and more that was reading out among the other people didn't society all are not eligible to remember that so for them slowly they started writing down and work it was done by a bit of Geass beta Plaza she sent out his disciples to all places all over the India and he told collect all this informations the knowledge is whatever the Guru's has said to the disciples go and become their disciples learn and then note it down and bring it that was a great work that he did so we got the wielder and then he segregated the beta in four different way reexamine a Targa that the name and each vida is having four different chapters like this like this so readers why it is so important after marker after means realized so after the realization when they say if you go in turn listen to the reader or the doctor almost so many millions of people the professors at the air even the person who has come to meet Saddam Tichenor he was a great parenting and now Saran Krishna he is asking question to Salaam Krishna or other people over there they are asking the question to Saddam Tichenor that man is also there and he is also listening how to realize God through the path of diversion now he's asking what type of yearnings are necessary if our son necessary to get that Lisa Brahman the rich over there the realtor says you have to have the three things authority Authority means routine you have to depend on that believe on that sit in calm logic the suti then look t30 means listening have all the veda and duty duty means logic this reason bechara otherwise how you reach over there the monastic this man the monastic Vedanta there is no devotion this is a God there is no other way like we are practicing over here the ritual the emotion and early morning lead guitar and then bathe daily prepare food for God nothing is there only one thing is left for the practice to understand which are which Rajai atop each other particular they say now you have to go on reasoning what is the reason what is true then what is untreated what is permanent but what are the things are impermanent so that we constantly you have to go on that's only be so be Chara is the second but bechara cannot take you to the ultimate you go on arguing if you find that if you read the brahma sutra the so many varieties of schools schools means the ideas they are coming and then putting forward know what you are telling like this but it cannot be like this how it is we are going to conclude this way that we all can spend thousands of years the scholars they were debating so which are and where you will reach them so final step is realization self realization Atma an abuti Atma anubhooti unless and until realized the truth you will never be able to understand truly what is God or what is Brahman you're just being on a doing somebody was telling the goddess is just like white like the snow he's the Shiva someone to know he's black it's dark you because we do not understand God so it must be done and someone do looking with it in between so all the imagining so Hindu gods and goddesses having so many varieties of color while imagination but if you go to that particular devotee and say why this God is having this type of color hey don't talk like this why you are talking like this this God is like these only but who first saw that God is in that color so there is no bechara but these people the ganimard is they only listen to that okay god may be having that color god will be having this many hands but what is that to me what I want is these the happiness can God give me that that is the main thing so they are not going to get the heaven no heaven even means a good life conception of it means good life but it is the joy eternal joy and free from the birth and death saga so these are the two things so how three steps at the first authority that is duty duty uh no booty in sanskrit su t UD underwood nothing else so they are asking this question to saddam Tichenor and the the suti duty and mana booty this three houses on pitch now we'll apply the authority of the beta is equated with self-realization now how I don't know that there is a map and in this map if you follow he will reach over there to someone into the map so he went all that way and then he done that that word and that has been printed it has come down to us nowadays it is so easy to satellite it is coming straight to me and then we are just following that great faith company faith we are going over there why that man who has drawn this man we didn't believe you because he must have traveled to that path so he has given the chart that is so odd a realized person so we take the map for granted and we still start going after reaching what the available green we are taking a yes in the map they say you are crossing this road then this field will come then a railway crossing will come then the market will content is that as we are moving we are all thinking ah yes now it is coming now it is this now it is there and nowadays a pop will come a flag let me see where we have reached to your mobile and they go on telling the right hand your destination in the right order station up there sometimes they say say it some wrong thing also but you have to be careful but activity we reach over there with the help of the map beta is that man beta gives us this and if you follow this way this way this way you will reach over there but we must reach there otherwise what is the use of this and the in other country when you were very young the system was you have to study all the countries in the whole world so many countries so many we did so many different type of land maps and also the history Waimea rate that we never visited those places but somehow they wanted to give us I do not know it is a good or bad they wanted to give us some general knowledge now the weather of the Africa I never visited Africa I don't think but still I am reading what is the necessary they may ask so same way I have to understand I am going to realize God trusting so this will come true the first thing I'll see see that you are going to go over there then you study this if not well necessary you're spending your time I want to go to God because I have something to say fulfill so in order to study the scripture you need not to study all these things and arguments be Chara nothing just lit evaded you go and pray you can apathy Papa I heard that you give me all this so we were comes and prayed please this is my prayer then that much your majority of the people of the religion they do that they go with some desire they go and give it to the God please give us the success some most of the time they gave it and sometimes you don't get it looking but here it is not like that I am sincere that I like to reach the prominent what is that Brahma blissfulness I know that that means I have studied the Vader and come to know from the Builder that it is blissful and that please that joy that happiness is not coming from anything outside it is not depending on anything outside so then they go which are how to reach over the guidelines are there and finally nobody I realized that and then I said yes these are not true this correct that's why show me be vacant the same religion is realization unless and until you realize even know where and again it says what are the practices in the Vedanta sweet you have to have the straw vana monana admitted the archer you see three Savannah was hearing hearing from your guru monana wandering over there going on discriminating those words guru say this is it true can I reach over there stubborn ah modern middle dashing of meditating of that what is the meditation the ABC understood that and you're marching into that truth the Savannah banana the did the arsenal tsu'tey UT a new booty so this is the regatta ultimate chorus goes and Serrano Krishna soup T that the logic the reasoning cannot decay anywhere you'll be confused and he is giving a beautiful story and and in the Gospel of Saddam occasion three teams were there dacoits they got hold of one person and they drop them off then 1/4 that divided toward C it is rated to kill this man otherwise he may go and complain against us killing second man turn right to kill unnecessarily bind it over here is a jungle so that animals of the earth they will come and they will kill him so let us be free from that C so binding and the hard one he secretly came and opened him from that and they do come I will show you your village from distance you were showing see those lives that is your village go think this man told he was so climb so good you are helping me so much why don't you come along with me see I have also declined I cannot go over there so naturally the police will arrest me I can show you up to that what is that sergeant dama dama wanted to kill Raja - okay just find him and leave him over here and then Sutter cane released him and showed up to that and City that much but finally you have to reach to the goal no one can help you so that is it's called the realization the final step is the realization and to reach the goal the blissful names how to strive that is the question and Cyril focus now will read from the gospel page 497 history one feel feels Restless for God when one soul longed for his vision the Restless that is the world he never wants anything else and nothing can satisfy him death restlessness the people who say to the disciple come with me I shall show you what kind of longing will enable you to see God saying this he took the disciple to a bond and blessed his aid under the water after a few movement she released the disciple enough how do you feel the disciple answer ho I felt as if I had time that is that is the understanding so as if I am trying without God so what type of yearning is necessary if what is necessary as if I am dying without that - that is the answer then the Saddam of this new study to love God is the essence of the whole thing he asked about Brahman we asked about blissfulness and cinema mister using the word God to love God is the essence of the whole thing when you go to the temple the priest you know is asked us to hold the thing in this way then bow now in this way in all religion so if you go to the churches they have the system go to the mosque and they have the system in the Hindu temples they also are having the different type of systems you must do this way and this way in this way if you go to the Mojave G they will say apply million great Ganesha rate then Durga different color Kali different color shiver different color so you have to follow those things here some some business setting is all external but essential thing for our thing is the love it is really the hub so he is stealing the love to love God is the essence of the whole thing bhakti alone is the essence he wasn't talking about the because there is a pernil and he was interested to know about the knowledge but Saddam officially is introducing the devotion bhakti the devotion alone is the essence not other safe to Rama me I always have to love for your lotus feet and we may not be deluded by your world is reaching Maya Rama Sita really asked for something more other than no set another I don't want anything else may I have love for died lotus feet this is my only prayer that this is the repulsion away my love should be attention should be attachment should be to you and nothing else bundles of sugar was ready to leave sadhana starts the devotee to bring a courage for the petit chèvre don't trouble yourself passion walk master smiling Oh how can they be shattered there is no particular need of my green just now the only thing is that I shall have to perform my sundown so these people are very very particular about their spiritual practices when even there will be the Sun Jia means two times in the morning and the evening so that time these people they will go and see it and meditate and take the name of God and do whatever the practices they are very very sincere now the next line what's our distance today mr. say the Divine Mother has taken away my Santa and other devotions the divine I'll model look at it no ever notice this world has taken away my son Terra and other devotions the barber's of the Sangha hidden amidst the spiritual practices on a particular time the particles of the Sandia is to purify body and mind I am no longer in that state she's riveting I am no longer in the state but I don't know whether the Shahada the birth date could understand that point now another time one devotee came to see Lama Krishna the moment it became the evening immediately closed his eyes and started repeating the name of God sample whose Christians say the sitting before me why this is necessary because all these practices is to relish God only and since you I have reached the guard why that is not necessary why you are doing there after reaching the destination it is not necessary to keep the engine on of your car or driving around together there couldn't even be still what then after the destination your friends and their relatives are there you go easy to talk to then you become very joyful happy - that is the main thing after the realization of God after the practices you should feel joyful otherwise what is the purpose we go on practicing just like a machine all to our life but we reach no heaven - these are the points this is the power when the Pancham evader this is the gospel of cinema busines pointing so clearly they have used somewhere your longing is of course necessary but don't means the target so their target is pointing then he started singing a song that was the speciality of sadhana business moment he wanted to express to give the idea used to sing a song when will you learn to lie you mine in the abode of blessedness so that with the mind you should reach over there and be very happy the shadow that at the pan deed the he is leaving now then he is sitting that I am going I've visited Schaffer yesterday you asked me to along history Rama is another disciple of Salaam o Krishna distances indeed I don't remember but it is nice that you wind why this the wrong one he was a doctor and he had that notion that he is intelligent and he can go and argue with people he can convince people he can convert them in the eye to dodging serum additional that versus cinema Christian that's why I immediately say oh you visited that she said I visited this particular person there sugar because you told me Salaam is to say did I I don't remember then he says was confusion otherwise competition the evil could got anything otherwise he would have asked what will happened over there after the visit what was the conversation so this time he never has drama but Rama thought that we should go and talk to him and convince him so this is the one type of devotee so we find the picture one his highest scholar but deed but at the same time the less in him is the arts for understanding the ultimate the heart diamond is the blessedness all the other practices that we do reading the scripture are following the rituals for what for the happiness so that is the ultimate second group of disciples this interpreting another group of devotees the team that they have understood and they want to go and convey that with others the master is not happy at all you have not got that authority to do so Saddam vishna all true we have found he was not at all happy but he liked Rama but this type of behavior in heaven light but he is a asking master knowledge I see mom go and tell this they talk to him and not only that he's praying to the divine mother mother give him some spiritual power divine power so that he can convince people convincing people is not hot metal thing you have to have the truth then only you can share that with others so this is what he is telling the Rama is excited he understand what he said so you did I I don't remember but it is night that you win the Rama stood the editor of a newspaper Indian empire there was a newspaper is no more was abusing you the master didn't pay any attention to death too sometimes some people that will come and tell this way a religious person should abide those this is the training wiki so when you are reading the convert our gospel of Salama busines the different lines are there and we read that sometimes it is interesting sometimes we just ignore because these are all normal behavior that has been recorded over here but this is to notice their sin additional heart that someone criticizing him see now Krishna was highly respected at that time the great people is to visit him so naturally he could ask what do you was telling about we never paid that suppose he was what does it matter he said just to say no on the face of the devotee we was excited the he was excited but the drama again he said please listen the no you have to listen to me what happened there then I began to talk to the editor about you he went to hear move and wouldn't let me go that in his I convinced him converted him and he was criticizing you but I actually transformed his thoughts completely differently so what we get from these lines the how they should behave not that we should not go and tell about the feet or the belief of the bad Daniel following we can't obviously but we should not have that ego that I am actually communicating the truth to him he is in ignorance so I am going to convert it no not that way but deviating is very very essential that's where sama question is asking the Narendra not the young boy to deviate with others and sometime asking the master version to talk to the other people debating why because our thoughts will get clear about I think in this way and I think that is the perfect that is wrong so this is exchange of views is necessary and intervener we find some places the devotees will be discussing about me and they get joy in there that is also necessary solution here a particularly not incorrectly norm because we feel that he was having a shut up ego the priest listen he strictly Ramakrishna please listen what happened afterwards I talked to him and then he started accepting you accepting that God is accepted because I told that think of it so this is the problem it was done sadhana is to be gay the names of the Divine Mother Krishna Rama and Marie so this is someone Maya we never find these in any other lives of the great teachers if they are following the one particular deity like Rama or Krishna or the Dali or others the only chanting name of that and nothing else yes now Costanza taking the name of the mother miss Galli then the Krishna then the Rama Ann Marie Curie means the Vishnu the devotee sat in silence the master chanting the names is a sweet tongue that the hearts of the devotees were deeply touched that day bala roms house was like novelty that in Bertram's heart was just like Naga tape double team is the place where chaitanya mahaprabhu the founder of the bengal vaishnavism he was born so novel dimensional India chaitanya mahaprabhu mostly lived in the holy Shah and his fertile assistant about the binbin God so he's doing as it gentleman who was there and all people was so happy second line he is writing Balarama that we know it was a very rich man and he used to have when the outside in those days the most of the people rich people instead of hitting people is to have two parts of the same residence the building the front portion the outsiders will become the main part lyrica they will talk they will see and inside the other lady is another so naturally this was the outside still now is their same thing they are given that particular building to the ramakrishna mission now it is Balarama Mandi the name of that particular building Balarama deal and there see Ramakrishna were sitting on the veranda Behav externally it is like never TV and in the parlor when Peter II it was like that in Darwin in Bengali original Bengal it is written by Healey prettily the outwardly and inwardly while translating the Shawnee changed into the on the veranda the outside that is like neva T and in the parlor that was inside the room that is like Brindavan I imagine like this translation in different way to make the people who have not visited that to external and internal both places are full of joy the still words how to reach to that the silliness now ultimately the master moisture coming he sternly it was the practices it was the discussion it was the discipline the guru and that is the all the devotees so that is BA healing that is externally on the verandah it is all joy because it just before he has written one line it is just like Brindavan when Jatin new mantra was there the full of joy and internally again it is Brindavan where the Krishna the God is society that is the main source of the joy so concluding in this way the same night scientist was to go to the vision Asia please just living the description Ballard I'm looking into the inner apartments and served him with the refreshments the outer apartment the inner apartment mostly the rich people is to have the stable building the ladies of the family saluted the master you know in our in those days in our society the ladies they are not allowed to come out and the people who made them to see them so they were inside and they still like to go to visit this particular house in fine there are some windows the ladies used to see it inside and from the news to see what's ramakrishna is singing dancing talking they couldn't see but the other people they took notice that ladies are there so this way the ladies the wait inside until the meal and while he was taking the refreshment this devotees were singing written in the drawing-room awaiting the master to come back presently Saddam Mishnah came and join the seniors the digital blamed on behold my Korra is dancing guru mr. Chetan Amara so that is the scenery that we gave and finally is a festival at Adams house the another the description is going there is beginning we'll start that and then we will conclude it was Sunday I was third 1884 Saddam official was sitting in his room in the temple garden adoption initial hidden he has even that others are but beginning with the - nation - sometimes some people they get confused why the title is this and the description actually master Bashar beginning from surroundings place what he was doing and then he is coming to this others house other words a deputy magistrate he was also very respected person in the society Saddam pistol used to visit that God is to visit this type of families houses why because they had the capacity to invite others this rich people so they had the capacity big house big burner they could invite people they could feed them so strong business to go over there - sometimes some people when they invite me I always say indict some other persons also the neighbor your friends the main people they don't have the time to come to listen or they are not interested but being a mall this is our duty to go and tell this so that at least one person the mind they will understand why the mission leaves as from innovation the very clear dimension to make people aware about their divine nature and to help them to manifest eight what is the divine nature love and unselfishness each and every soul each and every being the human being they're having that love and unselfishness suppose we were talking about the gospel of Saddam additional or other scripture certainly some personal heart hear it and then they feel yes this is good that much that is our service so Saddam officially introduced these services to a mission the ministry of service sometimes the people they say administer services little different they have other things also but the monks they don't do other things except taking the light of knowledge so cinnamony Schnur he is sitting there many devotees are coming the master began the conversation they had dressing the bomb musicians are cheap food a group of people the singers the bowel singers have come in the bowel this is a different type of spiritual practices so many varieties bowel bowel and so many so many so this small are very famous also because they will be praying to God through songs and they will compose immediately and they will sing of the dancers and nowadays is a folk song the same these vowels are actually not singles there are spiritual people practicing spirituality and their main thing is this this body is a temple and we don't need any temple any other temple this body is the temple inside the body the soul is the God now we need both the temple and the God without the God temple has no value and we go to a temple where he will search God so this body and the soul this is the temple and the god that is the constitution of the bowel and they will go on talking in that way but you must have to go inside and then there will be seven doors you have to open every gate and go ultimately where your God is sitting don't know have a open door after door that is the bowel they were singing in that way and now ceramic is not coming to the yoga what is the step in door slam krishna mentioning it over here Yoga is not possible if the mind is dwelling on last and so this is very very clear all the scriptures is telling that Jomon rom on income Jenna calm down any wrong again and again they say whether it is God that is not desired and where this desire there is no God so this cinema business mentioning in this way last ten boards the mind of the worldly man generally moves among the three lower centers those are the level and sexual organ and the organ of evacuation this is the name of that Malaga sedition money born in this tree this labor after greedy for the spiritual practice the Kundalini is awakened according to the Yogi's there are three nerves in the spinal IRRI pingala and sushumna allow the sushumna are six lotuses or centers the lowest being known as mooladhara then come successively swadishtana money food anata we should occur these are the six centers in the yoga they is mentioned the bowels they sing in this way only perhaps the master master has not noted that particular song but they may be that they were singing about this slowly you have to nowadays almost all over the all educated people who has any relation with the yoga particularly didn't know the mooladhara and all the six centers and then finally showers Radha then final stage in the meditation they are practicing ceramic is nur is singing in this way this seven stages if you go to Kashmir and that exceed a banach temple which was seven story building Sheila beautiful now when you go there's only wealth is there deep wealth but it was seven story temple why 7-story this seven now in Malacca to shallow sorrow so that people is to go fast the mulatto they will to go second third fold up to the seventh storey they should go and that is the symbol of the yoga in the Guiana mark is also the god seven yarn of boobies the naginata me this day say first is surah Baqarah na dhanam Inasa such TT asana Shakti padartha Bhavana and to Riyadh ah this seven we will discuss it maybe in the next time again the auspicious resolve that is cultivated chart now here in the Gyana yoga and Tantra these are all having different type of conception tundra is also accepting this certain stages yoga of course into using the seven stages and the animal is also having their own certain stages that begins with your desire to resolve first and foremost I am going to realize the government that is a fast schooi teacher sugar eat each other he will notice lord buddha in his teaching the Ashtanga martyr he mentioned eight months this is the we he was Hindu he naturally he was born in a Hindu family he was taught by the Hindu the mom he practices the Hindu way so obviously whole thing was in that line so when in his teaching he is mentioning about a stronger the different way is mentioning but mainly it is the seven what is that first history teacher Buddha is a follower of the knowledge so his teaching also comes to almost without doing the baton acknowledges first you have to resolve today wrong today I am going to realize the Brahman the practice will begin this you take care auspicious day one moment you resolve and start so su Eicher you cannot depend on your guru you cannot depend on your Guardians appearance you cannot depend on a mother but your own mind I am resolving that I am going to have this signal when we were young people this to say on the 1st January there's a new year that you are going to start what you are resolving in this year I'm going to achieve this smell you men many of you so naturally you have done the venoms is to say now today you write in your diary the 1st January so and so here I am resolving that I will stand first in my class like that they stay have that the first is spiritual and second is which are enough reflection the Schrager then the reflection Taliban Sabha the mind become Dean why team because there are so many thoughts are there in the mind and slowly we are we joined want our realization of the go so my opinion very theme which was fact has so many ideas were there now we are giving every oldest thing and only one the knowledge so it become very team then subtle but the subtlety means realization of the truth and the realities a subjective desirelessness after the realization of the truth what you deserve nothing and finally it comes the sixth product of Havana of gelatinous nests but the art of Havana padartha means the object I don't want anything I don't have any desire and next again imposing the same idea I don't want anything then transcendence to Ryoga to yoga transcend means this world that we see this world full of taste smell sight touch and all that I could beyond that that is the Dianna and Tantra and yoga they see mooladhara distant Manipur another vicious dog attack red and sahasrara saddam o krishna is mentioning about it and he is telling the pc is - you have to give up this world the desire for this world and this world means combination of the file you have to give up that and you have to put your mind completely on God or the Brahman which is the divisiveness how sativa the last tango there is again and again that was a slogan given the last tenth gold all the desires gold means you want the wealth fulfill your desire and when there is not that so no desire so that Lee is plucked up the two words lust and gold is a kingdom of the moment you give it up where the mangoes it becomes lead and team because no other desire Petaluma Nassau only one desire to see God to see God see God so there is the real we should understand that I have to realize God sometimes some people some devotees very young when they bring me and say there over the telephone I don't want anything I don't want to marry eight one days and there I want only to see the God I have any wonder at the very young age twenty seven twenty eight thirty years the desire is so strong and so many things were they there they wouldn't get the job but they could get the father was stealing and purchasing card counting is refusing that this is the way if the mind is one-pointed how it is possible begin to think what the blessings of God and your own desire otherwise it is impossible my own desire cannot take me to ultimate along with that the blessings of God is also necessary but my desire can draw the blessings of God how the last words of the bhagavad-gita the he is telling that when there is a Arjuna who has taken up the bow and arrow determined to fight determined to reach to his goal then the racing's of God also big sweet and you initial Krishna he had a part an altar here yogi shellfish not only ordinary Krishna yogi Shri
