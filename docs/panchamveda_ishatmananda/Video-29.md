[30. Panchama Veda 30: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5CPYwNgnDA)

let us begin foreign in our last discourse on japan the gospel of siram krishna on the 19th last we were listening to sirama krishna apparently a dualist a worshiper of mahakali in image and at the same time a man who never read scripture and he was explaining nature of brahman to a person who got the title bidda sagar ocean of learning and very interestingly we noticed that sirama krishna was using the anecdotes the stories and the examples to explain the brahman why in his own words only one thing has not been defiled no one has ever been able to say see what brahman is no one has ever been able to say what brahman is and to discuss that to explain that the last time we discussed about the three puti veda a wonderful thing that is it's called the object the which we are going to know then the gyaata the noah and the knowledge the gyana knowledge then the knower and the object to be known these three things become one three poti three level three stages when it becomes one what is our object to know brahman and who am i brahman what is the knowledge knowledge of brahman so i become brahmana myself so this is the very special stage of mind and that is why no one can explain it it only can feel it anubhava but cannot be explained sirama krishna tells about the two brothers who after graduation came back from the guru gria from the house of the guru and then the father was inquiry asking them what you have learned about brahman and the one brother was explaining and quoting from different verses different scriptures he was explaining what is brahman and the another brother he remained silent because it is impossible to explain the father was happy with this brother he understood that this has understood something it is beyond explanation one cannot explain it so that is the reason brahman cannot be all other objects cannot can be we can explain many other things but not the brahman because it is we subject object and the knowledge all become the same to make his point more clear siram krsna says man often says men often think they have understood brahman fully once an ant went to a hill of sugar he is giving another anecdote we have to understand how vast the knowledge is because we understand many things at the same time we do not know the vastness and the depth of knowledge there we are nowhere we cannot understand anything that's why he is explaining men often think they have understood brahman once an ant went to be healed of sugar one grain filled its mouth taking another grain in its mouth it started homeward on its way it thought next time i shall carry home the whole hill look at it one grain is sufficient for it another grain only heat it can carry but thinking i will take the whole hill next time so that is exactly what we think that i will understand god i have understood god is just like an ant he is giving the example that is the way our shallow minds think they don't know what brahman is beyond one words and thought however great man may be how much can he know of brahman sukadeva and the sages like him may have been big ants but even they could carry at at most eight or ten grains of sugar he is giving the example the sukadeva is a wonderful sage even then he is just like this comparing with the knowledge of brahman so why he is telling this because the moment they say god is like this is a blasphemy they don't understand god means only these god means only this is the path they are against god anti-god for you up to that for the ant one little piece there is sufficient one grain is sufficient i am satisfied with this if you like you go in your own way so that is exactly salaam krsnastick the moment you say this much and no further blasphemy against god as for what has been said in the vedas and puranas then in the veda and purana they are going on giving the description of the brahman what about that do you know what it is like sirama krishna is telling about the veda and the puranas all our scriptures suppose a man has seen the ocean and somebody asked him well what is the ocean like look how he is explaining so simple but one can understand it so clearly the vedas volumes after volumes are there if you go to our library go to our bookstore so all vedas are there we look at it at all my god so much of veda and this veda means what the same knowledge how then surama krishna is explaining if a person is asking someone what is the ocean how it ocean like then the person will open his mouth as wide as he can because the ocean then he is still oh what is sight what tremendous waves and sounds as vast as possible the way it is possible you will try to tell it but the description of brahman in the secret book is like that it is said in the vedas and brahman that brahman is the nature of bliss it is satcheed ananda sarupa that's all when i traveled from calcutta to andaman i travelled by the boat the ship big ship and the moment we enter from the river the moment we entered into the that big ocean i could understand what thakur meant you cannot explain anywhere you look except the sky everywhere water the below all around everywhere water how can you explain and and the wind came and they were telling it is nothing not to be afraid of and each and every one they were trembling no one could take food all were vomiting i was having two of my monastic brothers they were sitting before the gate of the toilet because one is coming out another is going and vomiting and he is coming out sorry so this way it is going on so excuse me sorry so the shape usually it goes like this it's called this way it will be doing and then this way again so you cannot digest anything everything will come out is so difficult but somehow i had a peculiar nature i did not feel anything brother i enjoyed and then i went to the dining hall at the time 6 30 or 7 was the time i went to dining hall dining all people were thinking that nobody will come and they cleaned everything they were going to retire then when i they saw me well how come you're coming for food and what is there you have to serve me food so that is the nature this way we feel but we cannot explain when the waves were coming so big coming and breaking on the ship and sometimes just crossing over the ship unthinkable and that was nothing the captain and other people the sailors they were telling it is nothing how to explain when i was talking this to our devotees to our friends impossible previously i was in chirapunji those are you know hill bound people they have not seen ocean neither a big river even so when we were talking about the ocean they couldn't understand in the books ships and all these things are there they couldn't understand then one day there is a film cinema we were showing them when they saw the ship and the ocean they shouted it is not it is not it did not means beautiful in their language it is not so that is the way sirama krishna is trying to tell us that it is impossible even the veda even the upanishads even the puranas they are telling sachi dhananda that is also nothing somehow they are trying to tell shukha and the other sages stood on the sword of the ocean of brahman and saw and touched the water according to one school of thought they never blanched into it in shamadi one attains knowledge of brahman one realizes brahman in that state reasoning stops all together and man becomes mute he has no power to describe the nature of brahman even you know intellectually also we cannot conceive this idea is so vast so big and that is why they have brought down we will discuss that afterwards the brahman it is impossible for the ordinary man to conceive that idea the god is everywhere all pervading how people can ordinarily people can think of it all pervading god impossible and the next comes the that's why it's called the ishwara the hindus that idea they have formed because ishwara the person who is creating then sustaining and also ruling or maintaining then comes bhagavan then comes avatara then mahapurusha so step by step it goes in the primary level the teachers are there and then university level also there are professors they are also there and they are giving knowledge step by step each is important that is also important otherwise you cannot move suddenly if you call a person and ask him to be admitted in a university level how it will be so when you are asking a person to understand the formless god the god all pervading what he will think so that is the reason ideal is very high but the method to reach that idea we have to think about it is it correct so long long years thousands of years after the researchers so many things they have developed only to take the mind to that height so this is why what why cerama krishna is telling like this he is explaining again through a story once a salt doll went to measure the depth of ocean it wanted to tell others how deep the water was look at it it's not an ordinary dog salt dog the salt comes out of ocean and that doll is going to measure the ocean again and that's why triputi veda the knowledge the knower and the object of knowledge now the knower the doll is made of salt and that salt came out of the ocean and that noah is going to measure the depth of the ocean the object what happened it wanted to tell others how deep the water was but this it could never do for no sooner did it get into the water then it melted now who was there to report the ocean's depth the people who are traveling towards god realizing god they're transforming into god themselves and after transforming they see nothing but god everywhere how they can explain it once our first president brahmanandaji maharaj to him another swami came and told swamiji you have to guide this young people they are coming to become the monastics but they are not behaving properly in that way we have to properly train them if necessary you have to scold them and maharaja he said who are those people why this brahmacharyans the novices he said but i see no novices i see only siram krishna everywhere look at it you are asking me to scold them how can i the same god one thief came and stole i think a blanket or something from a monk and the monk chased the thief to tell i have so many other things why you are only taking this and go at it going away i have many other things also you can take it the thief was not understanding what is it but the monk saw no it is not the thief the god himself came oh god please be there the stories of the shadows are there so this way when we can see only god in everything how can i discriminate that this is good this is bad this i like this i do not like that is the state of the brahmana the moment we realize that state one ordinary person not ordinary because this sadaka after so many years of their life after life going on sadhana it's not in one life we come and go get it no it's not so easy it takes long long time and then afterwards when he realizes he becomes totally dispassionate all around oh let it go it is all the play and even forget his body and that's why after 21 days it dies who will look after the body he is not at all careful about the body that condition came to see ramakrishna then one another swami came because god wanted to protect him so he came and started almost beating sirama krishna person and forcefully is to force the food now you have to eat you have to drink you have to sleep you have to survive so that way sirama krishna so here we are reading from his words and he is not simply explaining his experience suppose a man has obtained the knowledge of brahman in the samadhi does he speak any more when devotee asking after the samadhi will you speak the master siram krishna immediately answering shankaracharya retained the ego of knowledge shankaracharya is a very highest philosopher is considered in the our our india philosophical uh schools they say the shankaracharya is the highest and he propounded this advaita vedanta not dwita no two it is only one but this one is not the one that the semitic religion is propounding this one is inclusive everything there is no minus everything plus everything all bad or good or indifferent all are within that so this shankaracharya retained the ego of knowledge if i am not having the ego i cannot survive and that is the reason shankaracharya in order to teach others because the compassion oh if i don't go to them if i don't tell them how they will know and if they are not knowing it they will the moment i think let them suffer that means i am not compassionate i am not thinking thinking them as my own the mother cannot sit quiet when she sees that her children are going to history it cannot she will go try as best as possible so that is the reason shankaracharya after the vision of brahman a man becomes silent he reasons about it as long as he has not realized it what is brahman how this can be realized that is not the good part this is the real path all these things goes to whom who has not already realized a doctor or an engineer after passing all the exams when it comes to a good position then he looks to the students they are all discussing among themselves what type of competitive exam we should get ready and what are the benefits we are going to get after the result then all these discussions reading consulting only for them who have not achieved those who are achieved they don't talk because they have already achieved so this is the way the bee buzzes as long as it is not sitting on a flower it becomes silent when it begins to sip the honey but sometimes intoxicated with the honey it buzzes again look at the weights ramakrishna is explaining sometimes some people they'll be talking about religion but they are full even then why just for the fun of it but the joy of it so that's why he is telling and then again he is telling an empty picture makes a gurgling sound when it is dipped in water when it fills up it become silent so the way he is giving the example people can understand and mostly our young we were also like that the youngsters they will be all coming and telling why we had a meeting the monastics the pro the prospects and problems of vedanta movement outside india so that was the topic we were discussing and they were excited and they were suggesting we should do this we should do that different way they were suggesting and the general secretary of swamiji he was simply sitting and oh you see that's a good idea oh you can try that's a good idea because we have already crossed all those things we know that nothing is going to happen by that it's not just a simple thing that you will plant and it will grow or we will construct is a human being you are handling a human being it is so easy to worship god in the images whatever food you offer oh god please take he is never coming and telling you why you have not put the salt in the food and you are offering why this is sour i cannot take it too much of oil but if you go to a living being every day he will say and naturally it is so difficult so the human being we are transforming is it possible for any other human being to transform a human being no impossible just you are standing like this and telling sisters and brothers people will clap no so i i told you perhaps the one gentleman in calcutta he came and in a big you know almost 14 000 people huge gathering and he got excited seeing that huge people all people and he stood like this like swami vivekananda and he said sisters and brothers of calcutta nobody clapped why should we because we all know that we are okay the second sentence third sentence is going on raising his voice and uttering the same thing then the president of the meeting the swami location of the ji he came and whispered it is ok now you continue simply altering honduran because with that you should have the feeling the one gentleman here he drunk a lot and then at night i think two o'clock he knocked the door in the astra and told i am the girish of america then the swamiji he said i am not the siram krishna of america you go like he was expecting that the moment i will say girish they will open the door and siram krishna did it but the kirish had that faith and you are imitating only you don't do so that is the way sirama krishna is telling when the empty people they'll be talking they'll be talking so many things but it's of no use those who are full they they have a different way they can teach people and only god can transform human being cannot it's impossible we may be just suggesting that's all but all the time we pray to god if you think that this is good for him or her please help her help him that's why so this is what rama krishna is telling and then is telling the rishis of the old attained knowledge of brahman one cannot have this so long as there is a slighted stress of worldliness the knowledge of brahman that all pervading god is so difficult to attain very very difficult to attain but in the kali yuga man being totally dependent on food for life cannot all together shake off the idea that he is the body so this is practical that swamiji the i think sunday in his discourse he was telling be practical see how practical siram krishna is he's telling the in the kali yuga we cannot forget our body so obviously in this state of mind it is not proper for him to say i am he aham brahmas me the moment you are telling that i am brahman only you are telling but are you really feeling the as long as you are not feeling so behave as it is now i am trying to reach up to that then this is the thing only you can then some people they have the they think that if you are helping the swamis you get the merit and all those then i was supposed to go from howard to delhi i only purchased the ticket and there was no reservation in the train it was crowded one devotee came to help me and he went to the conductor and he said please take the swamiji arrange a seat for him and and swamiji's blessings will be on you then that gentleman looked at me and said because i was very young that time i just got sannyasa he said what swamiji if i give you a seat over here and take you to delhi will i get your blessings i don't know i don't know whether you will get the blessings or not but i will get the chance to go to delhi this is necessary and he was very happy so you need not to hide anything that is what's ramakrishna from your own position you try i am this much from here i will try i will try i will try and then slowly will reach the same goal that is the practical way of reaching seeing god everywhere is it possible i am not telling the name that one gentleman in andaman we had a discussions about different religious people one gentleman came from delhi and he was telling i cannot understand why the hindus should worship in the images and all this god is all pervading how can be tad then i told friend tell me truly when you close your eyes and pray what do you see what comes before your mind's eye what do you imagine truly not to me only to yourself you need not to disclose it to anyone go stand before a mirror tell it and tell to yourself are you really true whatever you are telling really you realizing it if not what is wrong in accepting what is the problem i don't know how to drive a car but if i try to drive the car what will happen i will kill many people or injure many people i'll hurt myself also isn't it tell that i don't i can drive the car somebody will pick you up and take you that's all try to learn it slowly slowly what is the harm next day morning early morning he came and he told you are true you're correct i cannot see anything when i close my eyes and try to imagine my god so many pictures come in before my mind and particularly my grandchildren they will be line up i love them so much that's good what's wrong you're a householder and you love your grandchildren and you are looking at them and then not as a human being you see them as god so this way if you are going it is not my teaching is a teaching of krishna so it is going in this way in kali yuga we cannot follow that path the gyani gives us his identification with worldly things discriminating not these not these but those who are following the path of knowledge they will say not these not these not these the grandfather of swami vivekananda he became a monk and he left the home but suddenly he was in kashi benares and suddenly he came to a place where his wife and others they were there the moment he saw that guru maya maya he was running and then he ran away so that was the way and then he wanted to test his mind so after 12 years he came to calcutta he was staying in a friend's house so that i am living near to my relatives near and dear ones but i am not attracted to them is it possible he came to test like that so sometimes in the previously people they used to do like that but present day ramakrishna mission only bachelors can join previously because the marriage age was very 18 16. so that was the way the society was so many of our swamis they were married brahmanandaji shivanandaji like that swami vivekananda and one very rich person he wanted vivekananda as his son-in-law and he told if he marries my daughter i will send him to london to study suramar krishna heard it he ran to kali temple and prayed to mother kali oh mother please don't bind him he has lot of work to do so marriage is a different way but some people they should not go to that because they should be free from the bondages and free from the bondages means for what just enjoying here and there no they should be dedicated to god and their life can be given for the service of the meaning when i was asked to go to arunachal pradesh a place where no one will like to go if you ask other people to go and be there we will go even the government officers they will always after two days two months or three months if they are posted over there immediately they will start writing for the transfer they don't like to stay with the who will but we enjoy staying there we know what to do we have to serve god we have to take the name of god and we have to serve the living goddess something will go on in calcutta the same thing in chicago the same thing they were telling oh you are going to america and you what i am not going to the sewage i am going to america but i will be in a room i will be only taking the name of god that's all the same life so it is not the place but the people with whom we live why because we don't have bondages we don't have any attachment but those who are already there they should not behave like that they have to continue as long as god keeping them there and going on praying praying praying praying and time will come when the god will say okay you are free so that is the reason a man cannot live on the roof a long time the brahman means is telling padhani in the surah saari gama padha ni the seventh those who learn the eastern music the first thing they will be going on playing and the base is saha and the highest is knee one cannot continue on knee for a long time siram krishna giving an example the one cannot live just with brahman not these not this he is living with the society so why not think about the society the universe and its living beings big ani gyani then big gyani ghani means the path of knowledge the person following the path of knowledge and beginning means above that is a special knowledge what is that that reality which is niruguna without attribute is also saguna the same thing it has happened god which is not having any form the formless guna means satya rajatama the three qualities but it is also having those things all that we see is nothing but the manifestation of god so this is the beauty suramar krishna he was rebuking narendra nade narendra because once you practice meditation you feel like practicing meditation all the time so that is the reason sometimes if some monastics they are in discipline sometimes from the headquarters they'll be asking them to go for some tapasya they say for austerity and then at the top beginning they will be feeling oh so much of difficulty no food no the proper shelter nothing is there too naturally but when they start doing that it is so intoxicating the meditation all alone all through the day no one around you are only singing you are only reading you are meditating you are just alone and that is so fascinating they don't like to come back that's why when they sent for punishment yesterday for three months not more than that within three months you have to come back otherwise all will go for that who will come to work in the society whenever society is so many difficult things are going on so that's why suramar krishna when he was teaching narendranath the young the swami vivekananda and he was meditating he got the joy of meditation sirama krishna asked him what do you like to do oh i like to meditate all through sometimes only i will get up from meditation take some food so that my body remains and again i will go down to meditation those who have practiced meditation a little they can understand that when the mind will become one pointed concentrated a tremendous joy comes from within and you are oblivion about the whole external world never care about the world whether it is snowing or sunny never cares so that's why vivekananda then suramar krishna reviewed him why i thought you'll be like a great banyan tree so many people will come and get rest under you and you are thinking about your own joy in meditation no i will teach you more higher than these people are teaching about meditation those who are teaching they don't understand mostly like me you don't understand what is meditation and then those who are learning they also don't only external but then when the real meditation it comes is excellent now cerama krishna is telling that is also nothing i will take you to a higher stage what is that what is meditation we try to see god within our heart and there we merge with god and god is nothing but joy so we feel joy now suppose you open your eyes and see all people all around nothing but the manifestation of god it's not the same joy that's why siram krishna said you can see god by closing your eyes can't you see god by opening your eyes the ramakrishna mission is a paramahamsa sannyasi we the sannyasins are supposed to be in isolated places but here they ask us to go and serve the people how you are serving them only trying to give them this knowledge that you are divine in whatever position you are whatever work you are doing you are divine what is the symbol of divinity love you have love within you that love only limited when it will be all covering love all embracing love when you are feeling for others then you are spiritual and that is called big gyani a man cannot leave on the roof a long time so he has to come down then surama krishna is telling the path of knowledge leads to truth satya truth what is the truth i am god myself that is the truth i am telling it but not feeling it the moment we think about god what we think of all-powerful omnipotent omnipresent omniscient all-powerful god am i like that no i don't know what to do what not to do so many things but the path of knowledge leads to that as does the path that combines knowledge and love another thing he is telling the path of knowledge as shankaracharya he was following now another path is there the path of knowledge and love the knowledge and love means gyana and bhakti and when i see bhakti means the god in different forms i was so much feeling for the poor people that are detroit i heard the other people who are telling no they have the resources but they are like that when i find someone singing at the airport i felt so much to give him some money he's thinking good if i could meet him earlier i would have invited him for our program it's nicely he is singing but the poor people some people they are telling no don't give because they're depending on that arms they'll be beggars they don't work but there's singing giving us the joy of music so in exchange we can give some money but then they again they are telling no they are all intoxicated people they will go and drug and all these things are there so don't help them government is give so whatever may be the moment we see somebody suffering so much pain it comes in the mind why because the feeling it is not the ordinary person is the god himself standing over there the god the suffering in detroit the people when i saw it was so wonderful the city and now nothing is there the people who were in business the owners they are not suffering they are somewhere else they are doing some other business they have the capacity they have the capital what the ordinary people will do someone was the only ordinary job they used to do now they have lost it depending on somebody else and whole day what they will do so i was feeling if we could purchase that church where swami vivekananda delivered lecture for four times then we could start one service oriented astra at detroit no meditation no bhajan no puja only one thing try to help people in different way materialistically and encouraging them to join in some other job so that they can learn they can do so many other things and ritam atma param brahma satyam buddha in a yoga bashishta he says that sirama krishna was explaining he has not read any scripture but he was telling the truth he was explaining all these things and the same thing we hear from yoga bashishta the guru of sri rama chandra he is telling ritam atma param brahma satyam all these names definitions were given by buddhi the intelligent people they gave these names to one which is no form and he is all pervading why it is easy to understand so that we can easy to understand and can explain kalpita mahatma the mahatma the great people they gave these definition of this as ritam written means straight then atma the soul param brahma the highest brahman satyam the truth srama krishna was telling that it is truth the knowledge leading to the truth it's leading to the atman so these are only words the names one person wrote to me he came here to meet me but anyway i couldn't talk to him he wrote to me in the hindu scripture the same thing in different names i am confused what to do someone is telling that if you follow this path you will reach god another is telling no you should follow this path the gyana and bhakti the karma and yoga what to follow then he said i love so many gods then where on which god i should concentrate i love buddha i love kali i love krishna i love ramakrishna and also i love jesus christ then whom should i worship now this is the problem and that is why one should take mantra diksha why mantra diksha because in the beginning it is all like this in the our students days when you're in the school level used to go to school by walking now it is here everybody goes in the bus they are not allowed to walk i is hard but in our place we used to walk and all friends used to go and sit and there were so many small small shrines where their temples are there all both sides of the road and used to go and take like like this like this used to go ordinary days but before examination all the examination days is to go and offer pranam very nicely so that we get the blessings of god etc now so many gods then he asked one why so many gods if there is one god it is so easy for me to pray whom to pray then someone told me that some senior they told anyone you pray the same prayer will reach to everyone you need not to bother about so many you only need one okay you go whatever you like most you're dedicated and that is called ishtanishtha easter and who makes this guru he will say this is your rishta you must follow it in the beginning you may like or may not doesn't matter since the guru has said i must have to follow that's why in our scripture they always say you must have to follow guru whatever he says because in the beginning they always feel i should read these i should read that i will do this i will do that all the energy going here and there same energy must be pointed out to one and that one means who can select guru can select because they understand this is the temperament if you are doing it it will be good so that is the reason they are telling all these different names but only one but who is that brahman then tantra deals with only the shakti kali and here is telling yato bisham samud bhutam who is brahman from where the go this whole universe has come there must be something on the basis of which all these things well these are all changing today we are here after 20 years somebody else will be standing here or somewhere else i won't be maybe i don't i don't know i won't be here like this it goes goes goes where from it comes somewhere must be then it says from that god which is brahman and it merges in a yatan chati that only you are there otherwise how can you see then finally yes means sarvani liyante and all that merges in that the clouds that we see where from it comes from the water and the same cloud again raining and small small drops of rains are coming down someone is telling i am a big drop you're a small drop and see how i am falling see how you are floating like this they will be shouting crawling and competing then when they all go to that river or the ocean margin the huge ocean what happens same ocean again there will be the sun will go and they will vaporize they will again become it goes like this our life is also like that from where it comes and from where it raised and from where and in that where it merges is called brahman ghiyam and that is the lakshman here sirama krishna is also telling the same thing he is telling beginning for the seas that what is brahman is bhagavan look at it where is brahman and where is bhagavan but he is giving the same almost the same status brahman all pervading no form no action and bhagavan why the conception of bhagavan because otherwise you won't be able to understand what is brahman as i was telling from the primary level slowly slowly we go to the upper level when the people they will be cooking for god and giving it to god and they will be bringing so many things to offer to god and slowly slowly slowly slowly their love is spreading and these they started understanding others also they can live with everyone they are growing in spirituality otherwise the moment we think no this is the truth or other whoever comes either kill or convert is it no you are not grown into spirituality why because yours is only this much so that is the reason he is telling that you have to brahman and bhagavan personal god this is our personal god we come we pray we cry we call our personal god but the same god is all pervading is the god only in the picture no he is everywhere but why then this temple because it is easy for me to concentrate that's why the temples the churches the mosque and in the temple in the churches in the mosque no other thought should be there only one thought god god god and then only the moment the people enter into it they get that vibration one gentleman has written to me from kanada he came to visit and he has written swamiji it is unbelievable of course i have faith in god but not in the way you can call me a devotee but in the function time when i entered into it when i saw all the 50 monks sitting over here singing kandana with so many devotees i could not restrain myself i felt yes god is in this room he felt like that and the person who was not prepared he was not ready and he was not wanting also he came just to see out of curiosity even then he felt why because the feeling you cannot avoid is always going to touch our mind everywhere but only we are not open that is the reason we close our mind it is not open so it is not touching our us so this is the reason he's telling that he who is beyond the three gunas he who is beyond the three gunas is the bhagavan which is six supernatural powers we will discuss in the next class which are those supernatural powers living beings the universe mind intelligence love renunciation knowledge all these are the manifestations of his power we love others we like others we appreciate others we renounce do you think only we are doing it no it is because of the power of god god has given the power so we can do it those who are doing anything good again and again i told our volunteers believe it so when you are doing something good not for me but god is provoking you giving you an opportunity to do something good for him so this is the way cerama krishna is telling even aristocrat has neither the house nor property or if he has been forced to sell them one doesn't call him an arrows took it anymore the similarly god has the six powers and with that power only a little portion it coming to is touching our heart and we are doing so many things and the moment i feel like doing something good without the ego i am doing and nobody should else you do that destroys you got the opportunity you lost it the moment you say the god i am so happy that you have given me an opportunity to do something for you you are blessed you have been chosen god is endowed with the six supernatural powers if he were not who'd obey him so the god coming with that brahman totally different but for us ordinary people bhagavan with the six powers we will see we call sirama krsna's bhagavan srama krishna bhagavan that we will explain in our next class today up to this the effect of thanksgiving is also coming on us too people are less thanksgiving let us offer pranam to taku niranjanam is oh namaste
