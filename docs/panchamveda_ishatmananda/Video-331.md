[332. "There is such a thing as Inborn Tendencies" - Panchama Veda (332)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWUbfdnblc)

Anushka today the Wednesday evening we'll be starting the panchama Veda let us begin with the stotra jivanam Kalam angalam srimadatam aha we were studying that at Ram's house Dr ramdatta in his house bhagavan sirama Krishna he is visiting and naturally wherever he used to go the people used to come to listen to him so they have calm different type of discussions are going on and for last two Wednesdays we were discussing very interesting ah the topic like the arine Carnation Divine reincarnation divine incarnations and reincarnations of the jivas the individual Souls and bhakta gyani a different type of ah the discussions and he it is continuing bhagavan sirama Krishna he is introducing one the deja to Purna he is mentioning the master Masha introduced dija to Purna sometime the mastermashe said yes I shall did you go to panihati the panyatt is a place where people used to go for one type of the celebration sirama Krishna used to encourage the people to go to the Celebration so why in that celebration the all the devotees of the same mind same type of people they will be assembling and there will be the discussions and this devotional songs and naturally for some time maybe few hours the people's mind will be on that spiritual level so he is to encourage that in the bhagavatam also we find the bhagavan SRI Krishna is instructing the uddaba he is mentioning that a devotee should go to a place of pilgrimage where the same type same mentality people are there to develop the devotion and these are necessary and in one place in the again in the bhagavata it mentions that you have to eradicate subdue the two qualities Dharma and Raja with the help of the satwa and the students of vedanta we all know there are three different qualities are there satta rajatama and in that sataraja Tama that that we have to develop satwaguna the best qualities good qualities love unselfishness the service and all those good qualities there's a satwaguna and for and by that way we have to slowly eradicate the criticism the jealousy the hatred all this tamaguna and also the ego work associated with the ego that is the rajaguna so that is the Lord Krishna he mentioned here also we find the bhagavan SRI ramakrishna in his different actions he is asking the devotees to go to the place where others will assemble and whenever the new boys are coming who had the good Tendencies is to encourage them the you know the friends that is the whole of spirituality is the go beyond the suffering the that is the the suffering it is in the package of entertainment joy happiness all temporary but people seeing that the wonderful package they go to that they opt for that they like to have those and they supper who created it God himself and now God when he sees that people are making the mistake again and again they're going for that and suffering then he himself comes down in the human form and guide them and we call the Divine incarnation of the avatar so this avataras and in the present day is the same God the Supreme reality has taken the form of Sri ramakrishna very humble person he was born in a village and all those things he never attended in school formerly and but still so much of knowledge prove that those people they this to think that either you read otherwise you won't get the knowledge that is wrong this knowledge is a spirituality the Divine knowledge is completely from within and you have to withdraw the all sense organs from the Saints objects make the Mind tranquil go beyond the me and mind that concept and you get that spiritual knowledge and when you get the spiritual knowledge you get everything you know everything so this is the whole of ingest it is the whole of spirituality now here the Avatar The God himself is guiding us and now he is telling that you should introduce this boy with that by because Purna and we know those who are reading the gospel of Sri ramakrishna we know about the Purna and also the divija and that introduce them intended to visit the religious festival at panihati so he was asking the devotees to go to panihati is a long back almost like 400 500 years before bhagavan SI ramakrishna the chaitanya mahaprabhu he on you organized in that way you know that in India when the Islamic Invasion came and slowly slowly whole of India was captured mainly the Western Northern and eastern part of India a few portion of the Southern India was saved so this particularly Eastern part it was all these Islamic thing came and there were different type of thoughts different type of philosophy different type of culture so they were not understanding how to practice these and that caitanya mahaprabhu came this is the beauty and that gives us the faith that the sanatana Dharma the Eternal religion is going to continue the God himself came again in the form of Sri caitanya Prabhu and he introduced a very simple way that just take the name of Krishna the Lord Krishna Hare Krishna that's a goria vaishnav sampradaya as they call it today nowadays the gaudia means the Bengal that a group of vaishnava those who are worshiping the Vishnu and the incarnations of Vishnu like the SRI Rama SRI Krishna ramakrishna like that caitanya mahaprabhu also came in that and he introduced this and he started the functions like panihati then he asked the rich people to donate so that the very poor in those days that India was so poor and that the poverty it was very poor the poor people will be coming in the morning the whole day they will Spain they will be singing the Bhajan deals and but they need to eat who will eat so he asked one of his Rich devotee the why don't you feed them the with the flattened rise and the yogurt and the sugar and the sweet and that is a very tasty food and people will enjoy that and they can continue the spiritual practices so that is called panihati mahotsava utsava means the celebration after so many years after so many hundred years bhagavan sirama Krishna also encouraged the same tradition that was introduced by chaitanya mahaprabhu then he was encouraging people to go over there now it came in this way whether Christian the ghost will be there or not the sirama Krishna looks steadily at the DJ and he was talking feeling for the DJ is a young boy without the permission of the parents he cannot go anywhere so sudama Krishna was thinking how to console him because a young person when he heard that there will be celebration people will be going over there I won't be able to go because my parents don't give the permission so naturally see ramakrishna was consoling him and then came the the very interesting topic and SRI ramakrishna is telling there is such a thing as inborn tendencies I repeat there is such a thing as inborn Tendencies when a man has performed many good actions in his previous births in the final birth he become guyless in in the final birth he acts somewhat like a mad cap this is bhagwan's ramakrishna is mentioning and the moment he said like that naturally the question comes that is there that after the death whether the soul does he carry the Tendencies or the impressions of the previous Birds whereas there are beautiful books that I was just going through that Joe Fisher the case for reincarnation the the preface by the Dalai Lama the he mentioned ah different cases like that another there is a like a novel The wrote Life After Life by Raymond a moody a junior MD there is a doctor and it has been introduced by the new forward he is also an MD Alexander to Alexander and Many Lives Many Masters like a the story book is a beautifully they have mentioned that case after case how all these things have been now people simply they say brush aside oh this is all useless it is not not only present day even in the ancient time there was a philosopher who used to say oh Brothers we don't know whether we'll be taking the birth or not so let us enjoy in this life itself so there that philosophy is also prevailing in India in the previously it was there and in Sanskrit there is to say the that if necessary take the loan and enjoy the life and when you die who is going to recover that from you because you are dead so do that so this to encourage this type of things in the name of philosophy and that was also honored because that freedom was there but whatever apart that this is the thing that each and every one accepted I was going through the one uh the article that Mr K r k Murthy he published in that bhajans journal I don't know whether the Virgin generals still continue or not it was very famous Journal they used to publish the headquarters was in Bombay and in that bhajans are the problems Journal February 208 he published an article and there he has given very clearly and almost like a research work who are the people the in the world they like this or supported these appreciated the rebirth Theory and he gives the different tribes who believe that Souls exist even after the death ancestor worship is prevalent in Philippians Central Asia Siberia Australia Africa the Aztecs and the incurs of the Central America The Kills of the ancient England and the Ireland the Mesopotamians and the Egyptians in the other whole world we can say this to believe that the permanency of the Soul ancestors worship is still prevalent recently before the Durga Puja all the Hindus they went to the rivers and the holy Rivers like the ganga jamuna godavari like that they go and in millions they will be offering water remembering their ancestors the water food flower incense sticks and all that is a ritual the some people may think oh how it is possible but this this is the belief and not only a belief this is a realization of the rishis also and moreover when you look at the people at the same parent same father same mother your two brothers having two different type of tendencies how it is possible same parents same schooling same social environment they are growing up everything same then how they are having two different type of temperaments and tendencies and behaviors how it is possible so this is the Hinduism the Jainism Buddhism Judaism taoism they all believe in it in his book life after death Swami Vivekananda that I will read a few lines from that he very categorically categorically mentioned Hinduism and Buddhism have it for their Foundation because Hinduism and Buddhism they believe the the soul it travels from Life To Life body to body is very clearly it mentions as the we give up the old garments similarly the soul give up the old body and go to another body just like that and he is mentioning Hinduism Buddhism have it for their Foundation Egyptians believed in it ancient Persians arrived at it the Greek philosophers made it the Cornerstone of their philosophy the parshis among the Hebrews accepted it and the sufis among the Muslims acknowledged it we find that they are asking the question the very fast uh the Mantra of the shetta upanishad it says that asking those who have already realized the Brahman that ultimate knowledge by knowing which everything can be known the past present and future so to them they are asking can you please tell me what is this Brahman what is the characteristics of the Brahman and can you please tell me from where we are born and where we are sustaining and what will happen after the death these are the questions they are analyzing the to conclude this particular topic we can say the koshutiki brahmana upanishad it mentions in this way the after the death the soul that goes to the moon and there they rest and those who are having strong desire they come back through the rain and they entered into the food and then that is eaten by the male body and from him it is born it is not the father and mother giving the birth of a child it is the soul according to that kaushadiki brahmana upanishad it is that spectacular soul he wants to enjoy his karmaphala either suffering or enjoyment whatever according to the strong desires it takes birth and not only that after the death as a human being he will come back as a human being maybe the the physical attachment is too much and wants to enjoy the physical enjoyment too much then it may take birth in the animal body in the reptiles body may be in and different in the Kato punishad also it mentioned in this way the nakashyapristati sukriti anubuth way imams in the heaven just suppose we have done very good work and naturally we acquired the merits and we go to the heaven we enjoy all the result of our good work then when it is exhausted when it is over because we are acquiring that anything that we acquire it as a time limit after that we come back and when we come back we do not know because of our desire we may take birth in different forms and different bodies that is the reason the morality why morality just fear of the law fear of foolish fear of society no morality for me if I am doing bad work thinking in bad way using bad language for others or criticizing others and denouncing or saying something that is creating problem for some people the inner three ways we work that through physically or through words and even in thought whatever the thinking that work is going on the that result will come back to me so that is the reason again and again some people they don't understand and they think oh it is okay we don't believe they will be going on taking birth in this different type of circles body places time and suffer and suffer and suffer you can just close your eyes and see how people the forget about the other beings human are suffering so much and we are constantly chasing the happiness because from the happiness only we are born so our goal automatically we like to go over there to the happiness but we do not know how so we go for that wonderful package that is left before us but we forget the teaching or the teacher the great teacher of the god in human form don't do that when we forget that we suffer upon brahmana upanishad it says that you have to come back and those who are very good in their life they go to devaloka some go to pitri loka there are people who will be worshiping their ancestors they are their mind is completely associated with the family and they are very proud of that family they think constantly of the family so what will happen after the death they will come back to the same Circle in the same family in the same tribe in the same way and it goes on and on that is a belief that is the faith they say but those who have understood it that everything is futile everything is temporary it doesn't matter whether I am in this family or that family in this Society or that Society all are temporary just like the Miracles so I am not going to take it again then they go for the path of God and they go to the heaven and if they continue in there also the Discrimination so this is also though it is a good place but this is also very temporary now I have to go for the permanent Joy like to go beyond the circle of this I like to stop this play this game then it's called mukti or Liberation a different type of names the words they have used so they go beyond it where do they go they go into the source of Joy Eternal Joy Eternal happiness so bhagavan Cinema Krishna mentioning it and he is mentioning this way that there is a thing as inborn tendencies friends those who have read the biography and also they have noticed in their gospel that one person whose name was sidhu he brought Master Marsha mahindranath Gupta to bhagavan siddama Krishna many of you can remember that but that sidhu siddheshwar he never came back to Sri ramakrishna the God incarnate in over there he came to dakshinesha not for sirama Krishna but for the garden the beautiful building and beautiful atmosphere look at it so this is called tendencies nowadays millions they are praying and meditating and worshiping and fasting they're all trying to get a glimpse of bhagavansi ramakrishna within their heart and their rare people who wish to come and sit before srirama Krishna the god but they were not happy they wanted to go away they wanted to go and listen something else of the worldly discussions so this is tendencies sidhu and our the master maharsha Mahindra Gupta the when both of them became mahendranath he felt oh God is a beautiful place a wonderful person each and every word that is uttering is like the bhagavata like the spiritual teaching I must come back yeah it was his feeling and his friend was why you are unless you're wasting time he is the person living over here like him so many are leaving because the landlord they allow them to be here and he was not taking it this seriously he was rather enjoying the flower garden and these garden and that Garden where you see that now the siddeshwar very easy the sidhu the sidhu now we are remembering just because of the master Marshall he mentioned his name and we are remembering to compare and that proves the Tendencies about which bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning here there is such a thing as inborn tendencies the when we were reading the bhagavata we came across that the bhagavan SRI Krishna is mentioning to uddaba that you must increase the satwa satbaguna and slowly you must completely destroy the Raja and Tama then you have to go beyond the satwaguna the people become satisfied with the satwaguna majority of the people they think that is religion no that is not religion religion is the realization of the Supreme Consciousness which is nothing but pure love pure joy pure existence so that we have to keep in our mind but satwagona means helping others not telling the the false thing or doing any bad thing like that like they're all good qualities but that is not the ultimate that is also a process the last step now the question came how I will understand that I am increasing the satwaguna the very interesting question the Lord is mentioning you have to increase the satwaguna and you have to destroy the other two lower gunas like the Raja and Tama another question is how I will understand that I am increasing or or the satwa Guna has increased in me there the Lord says when you will find attraction for me the god there are people they will again and again come to the shrine they will again and again listen to the gothamrita the gospel and other scripture and they will always feel Joy in talking about God or listening to the bhajans so that shows that they have developed the satwaguna the meaning of our devotees I have noticed even when it is snowing or raining and the weather is bad they will surely come and sit in the shrine and they will meditate they will pray that shows the satwaguna has increased otherwise any opportunity they'll say oh it is okay I was thinking to go to Shrine into Temple but God is everywhere it doesn't matter that I have to go there it's okay then they will be reading the newspaper or listening to the news and then they'll be like that like that they will be spending their time the satwaguna means the feeling love and attachment and attraction for the Divine thing so bhagavan SI ramakrishna mentioning the Tendencies some of the people are having their Tendencies the moment we come to know about that aware about that the I have the capacity to go beyond these two gunas and I have I am already having a Psalm the satwaguna now our goal should be to go on encouraging that increasing that and more and more we can improve ourselves the more will be close to the goal when a man has performed many good actions in his previous birth his final birth in his final birth he becomes guileless the simple person most of the people they cannot become simple they always thinker crookedly anything they'll be judging in a very different way never can take it simply so that is the the way we can understand the who is the satwaguni and who are not so these are very clearly the definitions are there it is very clearly defined over there and we ourselves can judge that whether I am in the right directions or not tell you the truth everything happens by God's will now that is this ultimate truth that to tell you the truth everything happens by God's will when he says yeah everything comes to pass and when he says nay everything comes to stand still see when we are believing in the Lord so we are praying to the Lord and then trying to perform that action if it goes well that means God wanted it is very clear if the God is not willing is there anything that a human being can do nothing at all so naturally the good and bad that is also that's why that duryodhana that Mahabharata character and he became the villain in the Mahabharata the poor man he said to the Lord Krishna once janami dharavam foreign I know what is good what is righteous but I do not feel like practicing that I know what is unrighteous what are bad things but I can control myself I can't resist myself in doing that why this you are within the heart of each and every one you are guiding us it is because of you so friends we have to go on pray to the God please do not put me in the other side put me in the right side so that I can get your grace your blessings and if the God is with you everything it goes in nice way in the last sloka of the bhagavad-gita the 700 words of the bhagavad-gita it says yatra is mentioning the same thing in the bhagavad-gita nearly three thousand two thousand years before there's Lord SRI Krishna mentioned the same truth coming down through different Incarnation to different gurus if the God's grace and the human effort combined together then there will be success and that is bidura that is uh Sanjaya Sanjay is mentioning in this way that is it I am sure that it is going to be perfect the blessings of God or the grace of God the ears of God and the effort of the human being so we have to go on trying and trying physically mentally and through our words we should pray constantly we should go on taking the name of God internally and we should try to do good to the world thinking the whole manifestation is nothing but the gods himself so he is mentioning in this way why is it that one man should not be bless another because nothing can happen by man's will things can things come to pass or Disappear by God's will the other day I went to Captain's House I saw some young boys going along the road they belonged to the different class I saw one of them about 19 or 20 years old with his hair parted on the side he was whistling as he walked along I see some emerged in the thickest Thomas they played the flute and are proud of it so this when the bhagavan the God himself is noticing us so how we are dressed how we behave and what is our thoughts each and everything is monitored is carefully noticed by the god here the Lord bhagavan sudama Krishna and mentioning the other day I saw on the street of Calcutta that a young boy was mentioning like that and we think oh this is natural because the world is so natural for us real for us and we think the young boy he should behave like that that is natural but those who are spiritual minded they will understand oh my God he is going to into that so that God wants us to be free from this bondage and those who have done good work in the past and now in this life trying to be good for them this is the advice don't get caught into all this terrible net and suffer I see some emerged in the thickest Thomas they play the flute and they're proud of it to deserve why should a man of knowledge be afraid of criticism was a very though young but he was having the good Tendencies we call it samskaras so he was liking the presence of bhagavan's ramakrishna he used to listen to his talks he used to try to remember those teachings the good Tendencies sometimes young boys and girls they come over here some of them we we can see seeing there and the body language they don't like it at all as because the parents are sitting over here so they are asking ah that you must see it so he is just sitting but never even life but some of the same age after coming over here there will be listening all the talk and they will ask questions also they like to see the books the tendencies their parents asking them to sit in both cases but the good tendency when they come to a holy person and when they listen to the talks about God and the Incarnation about the Divine Life about the scripture they're interested so they like to know but the others are not very clear indication that is in the past life if we have not done good work it is impossible to have these tendencies this sometimes some people they say look at that rich person he never given a donation not wrong the God never takes his money it God never wants to take his money because he is so much attached to his money and they think oh my God if I am sharing this ten dollar or the hundred dollar then what will happen my stock will go down and my who will what will happen in future so much calculation maybe they are having millions but still they think in that way sometimes the poor people maybe they are having only 50 dollar but they don't hesitate to give ten dollar very good work so that God is giving that mental tendency to do it so that he or she will get the benefit in the future and that is for sure as because we cannot see directly we think oh these are all bogus thing no it is not if the god Wills then only we can give the temperament will come the mentality will come to donate it is not so easy charity is one of the highest practice of the spirituality why because we are earning then we are sharing it with others without expecting anything in return we donate to some places the in the in the clubs we are the members of the clubs we give the money over there to become the members of the club and so that we get different benefits and the social uh the associations the all those we go and give the money over there but we don't like to give the same money to others because we think we are we are not going to get back anything in return wrong the best thing you will get if you can truly share it but that depends on the Tendencies again so sudama Krishna is mentioning why should a man of knowledge be afraid of criticism why the DJ and his relatives his parents were not naturally any no parents will agree that my son should go and to a holy place and become a monk majority of the parents don't like it but here the dgo was the same but the others were there they used to criticize why at this age you were going over there when you are matured when you are old when you have retired from your services then you don't have any time other thing to do any engagement go to the shrine go to the temple go to the holy place wrong again because by that time the mind has already scattered everywhere and we can never bring it back and give it to God no that is wrong but anyway that is the Tendencies again so this here bhagavan's ramakrishna asking the division if you truly love God and you know that God is the only truth the God is the only existence then don't bother about the criticism some people and they don't know but they criticize so don't bother about that he's understanding is as immovable as the Anvil in a blacks means Sharp Blues from the hammer fall continually on the Anvil but cannot affect it in the list Master Mercier is a very artless man I saw X father going along the street so this line I missed it says I saw X father going along the street and I did never mentioned the the name so I don't know whether that I think I mentioned the I was reading from the page 783 of the Gospel of sudama Krishna and now here at the mastermash I said aim said his very heartless man Krishna but he has red eyes see ramakrishna told the devotees about his visit to Captain's House Captain had criticized the young men who visited the master perhaps hastra had poisoned his mind I was talking to Captain I said nothing exists exists except purusha and prakriti Narada said to Rama or Rama all the men you see are parts of yourself and all the women are the parts of Sita Captain was highly pleased he said you alone have the right perception all men are really Rama being parts of Rama all women are really Sita being parts of Sita the here we find as normally in the society there will be some people will be constantly criticizing and this is nothing new at the time of Sri ramachandra also we find some people who are there they talked against the SRI Rama at the time of Sri Krishna there were a people the enemies they were enemies of Sri Krishna and in the time of Sri ramakrishna also we find very close people they live so near to sirama Krishna but they will be constantly criticizing just now we were discussing whether we start religion at the phag end of our life or when we are young when our brain is very active and sharp when a physically also we are fit so physically and mentally we are capable to practice spirituality at that time shall we go perhaps the one person we knew that he used to sit very on the on the veranda the of the sudama Krishna and whoever is to come particularly rich people if the rich people is coming then he will be talking to them you'll be introducing them with those those people and they will be giving some advices and he perhaps told that look at this the young boys are coming to bhagwan's ramakrishna it is not good why they should come to a spiritual man why they should come to practice religion it is the time for them to earn money to enjoy the life and Captain he was the ambassador of the king of Nepal in those days uh he used to live in the Calcutta representing the king of Nepal in the court of the the British government of course we naturally he was a very big short we can say we are the big person he was educated and at the same time he was religious minded bhagavan sudama Krishna is to like him even though he was having a very high position in the society as an ambassador of a kingdom but still he was very simple used to come to the dakshinesia used to discuss about religion Etc then now when that Captain he mentioned that the young boys should not come to you you should not encourage them to come see ramakrishna didn't like it and he understood that this is the these are the thoughts that hajra has given to him this is a picture that we get the same thing always happen every time in every society in the Assam also you will find in our time there are people when the good people are coming they will be guiding them why you are here you better go over there there's a bit wonderful Meditation Center these that why do they say like that I don't know not understanding the real religion to just like to show that they are they are also having some conception about the spiritual life religious life this is a great mistake that they do so this also when we read this as a devotee we must be very careful the God is watching us so whenever whatever we do everything was bad that is why all these things recorded mentioned and we are reading and trying to understand ah we just passed through oh this happened no this is happening in our life also some of us are also doing the same thing we must be careful so he said sudama Krishna said that I was talking to Captain about the Rama and Sita Captain liked it immediately after saying this he began to criticize the Young devotees Captain like the statement the all men are the part of Rama and all women are the part of Sita now saying this immediately that is why Master Marshall is noting it bhagavan Cinema Krishna mentioned it he noted immediately after saying this he began to criticize the young devotees that means the statement that he gave the all men are the part of Rama was not his actual feeling just book reading this also we should notice the sometimes we read books and we quote from there we say these and that but it doesn't go to our real thought it is not assimilated how can I criticize when I say all men are part of Rama mentioning immediately after saying this he began to criticize the young devotees he said they study English books and don't discriminate about their food it is not good that they should visit you frequently it may do you harm bhagavan's and this person he is thinking that some people the young people in those days in Calcutta because of the the britishers they used to encourage to accept the life of Western life all these things so the Orthodox people they were they were scared not understanding who these Rama Krishna was this person he was a very highly as accepted in the society educated also a devotee must have read some of the scriptures but you see understanding is completely wrong the people who having the a big social position doesn't mean they understand spirituality the people having some certificates from the famous universities doesn't mean they understand spirituality so this we have to understand so when you are reading the gospel of sirama Krishna in every line there are teachings we must know it notice it and try to imbive it this is the Mystic that the captain was doing and they study English books and don't discriminate about the food it is not good that they should visit you frequently it may do you harm hazra is a real man a grand fellow a wrong conception most of us we go and accept people seeing their outward Behavior and that is the reason in the bhagavatam again SRI Krishna gave a wonderful list how you will know a person is a holy person we don't read those we don't understand that we never pursue for that we judge people seeing his external Behavior hasra he studied scripture he is to sit like the traditional Brahmin bear body only one cloth and then the bear Foo as a feet he is to walk and all these things externally but internally he was a very jealous person he used to think only about himself he was sitting over there only two things to collect some fond to pay back his debt that he had in his village and to purchase some land for him etc etc for money and for name and fame how that can be a spiritual person just in the inside the room he used to sit outside the room and inside the room was bhagavan sidama Krishna an embodiment of tiaga tag is Swami Vivekananda is mentioning he is the the god of the renouncers taga ishwara that's Cinema Krishna he was in in front of the the captain [Music] but the upadhya he could not realize it he could not understand it rather he is giving advice to him there are so many people that will be coming and giving the advices or you should not do this you should not eat it it goes on in the society and they do not know to whom they are talking and what they are talking they are foolish so religion has nothing to do with the food and the food doesn't mean only those things we test through our tongue it is also all the our five organs that is actions all are called ahar but some people are thinking they know everything so what he is eating how he is eating when he is eating through from whom he is eating their whole religion is in the kitchen only this is greatly wrong so bhagavan Cinema Krishna mentioning so this is the reason I always encourage people to study this Gospel of sudama Krishna and this is why I say it is the Pancham of Veda is the fifth Veda it is the only knowledge knowledge and knowledge knowledge about spirituality and that is the unique way he has expressed only those who can understand they can understand and he is staying then I gave him some moral blows his daughter laughed I said to him God is far far away from the worldly minded but God is very near the man nay within a distance of three cubits whose mind is free from worldliness thank you friends I think we should stop over here and we'll continue this discussion so it's a very practical way sometimes we are facing this type of situations now at the present day and 100 200 years before also the bhagavan siddama Krishna the God himself in human form he was facing the same problem standing before God himself a very ordinary person full of ego is telling the religion to him What About Us though we are practicing religion for say 47 50 years it is nothing the God himself was facing this type of problem why because in the world there are some people here they are so egoistic and so ignorant but they think they know everything we have to be careful from these people also the in our next class we will start from Reading from this is asking as a student how can you invite satyaguna in everyday life means the law suppose every day if you are praying they get up in the early morning I mean not early morning whenever you are getting up because you people study in the night so maybe that you are late in getting up so whenever the first thing you must see the photo of a god or goddess and secondly you must pray to the God for the well-being of each and everyone oh God there is so much of suffering in this world people are crying please forgive them if they have done anything wrong and give them happiness and then whatever way it is possible for you the little that you can help that is increasing shatraduna not that physically you have to go and do as because as a student you don't have time and it is not the time for the student to do that not necessary also Society will take care of it but you can pray for them you can feel for them so if you do these two things in the morning if you are getting up when you are getting up look at the picture of the god and goddess pray for the well-being of everyone and for yourself in the night before going to bed do the same thing by that way you will surely in increase your satyaguna thank you let us chant this Mantra and conclude [Music] um [Music] mama oh oh my Shanti Shanti Shanti harihio [Music]
