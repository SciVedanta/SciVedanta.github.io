[237: Panchama Veda 237 : Live Unattached in The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy0BfJzLLRA)

the Wakata rhythm dr. G Bonham cookie be rewritten Calma sharp 'him servin among golem shri mata Tatem vivillon ta marie dodging aha good evening dear devotees and friends today is that Wednesday and we'll be reading and discussing from the gospel of sri ramakrishna and we were reading from the page 610 that one pundit has come and it means the Sanskrit scholar so he has come and then ceramic Ishta was discussing with him the but the all this a different type of spiritual practices and so here we find a beautiful question and answer you should not say the question answer the statement at the pundits said and in reply to that ceramic is nice comment the pundit was telling revered sir I feel a spirit of total renunciation when I am here he is smiling and telling cinema Krishna was talking about the renunciation and pundit is commenting when I am with you I feel that that I should renounce but I feel like going away giving up the world then the ceramic ashiness replied this is the beauty a Bhagwan see ramakrishna some of the the practices we said there's some of the religions they immediately will encourage that man yes you give up everything and followers but sanam Krishna is not like that he is trying to help the person from that particular level and slowly slowly he should come up giving up the world is not that easy it's from the samskara so when suddenly out of emotion or some just too hard and then we think that oh it's good that we should renounce and will become a monk it's not that easy then not only he ruins his whole life it brings down that logic also so when the pundit said the master immediately replied no no why should you give up you should not give up give up mentally then he said leave unattached in the world the ceramic is not very casually he is telling but that is the highest philosophy highest spiritual practice that Swami Vivekananda said from each and every word about once Ramakrishna I can write the so much of philosophy that's true there's casually first he said no no why should you give up then he said give up mentally give up means physically but give up mentally physically very few people can do that that's not very easy thing so obviously that we use ceramic is nice not asking the people we enjoy the world be over there no he's not his jagadguru he's the master of the whole world he is the Guru spiritual the teacher so obviously his guidance will be proper he said give up mentally now the question is what to give up this house the property the job what I am going to give up what I am going to give up that is the question most of the time we make mistake giving up the desire giving up the attachment cinema Krishna that once again I am repeating and making the sequence the pundit the scholar sanskrit scholar he must have read all the pony shots etc that's why he's pundit and when he said when I come over here and see you and talk to you I get the inspiration for giving up the whole thing to renounce in incision when I'm here he is expressing his idea and cinema Krishna is telling because he is a married man he has a family he has to look after the whole all the responsibilities that he has taken up already so ceramic richness that dries is no no you should not give up why should you give up then you said give up mentally the physically you did not to give up give up mentally and then the last sentence he is telling leave unattached in the world is it as if so easy I'm not talking with anybody I am not taking anything from anyone I am living on others not at all living unattached means there is a very high spiritual practice unn attachment now you have to have the complete idea about this world that is called gana marquee the gana mark is that that those who are following the path of the knowledge what do they do they analyze and what they are analyzing just like the scientist are analyzing many things these people are also analyzing constantly and keeping the mind always on the supreme what is this war is a mixture of Jarrah and Chiana and very nicely it says in the venetie satyr under Tama tune et cetera the truth under the day the untruth that has been mixed up it is like the light and the darkness mixed up how can it be the juror is the inert and at the same time shaitana the consciousness suppose this food it gets the consciousness what will happen the table the table say hey what is this you are constantly using me and then you are putting so many heavy things on me why should I serve you like this the conscious immediately will react but juror will never do that it will be just like that when our body is attached with the consciousness which is life we call it life we are all the time using the fans and the AC at the time of summer and the winter it should be the room should be heated properly warm clothings why but the same body which we are covering with all that after the death you put under the this the body or the burn the body is not reacting at all that means something which is absent inside the body immediately the body becomes inert just like the wood just like any other things so inert and the consciousness clubbed together that is the life so how it is possible they go on analyzing that is called guiana Margy when you say God is in the sky he is the ruler he will punish you if you do something wrong and he will reward you if you are doing good but he to understand and we understand the administration the government the king and his ruling all this goes are almost like that but when you are taking the path of the Ghana your mind should be constantly calm and very active calm means you have to be calm because you have to you are analyzing something like the scientist they're very calm at one point it very active mind is very active one pointed here also the spiritual scientist going on how this is possible what is this glue that attached the consciousness with the inert answer is they have found out the pedantic scientist they will say Maya with a four letter word a may ye a and the profound math answer and that gives the complete answer what is this Maya there's a power of God through this power the reflection become original the untruth become truth that is the power so it is said the supreme magician as if i hypnotized them billions and billions of minds so like that hey everybody's a completely hypnotized what is the that I am seeing that I am so happy I'm feeling I am happy I am seeing that it's my friend I am seeing this is there but in reality it is not there's nothing it goes on changing now if we just we are all elderly people now now let us think that when we were young and in the school how our friends were so close there are all of our friends there but there were some best friends so they'll be coming close together four or five every time talking and going together to see something playing these that and we never thought that we'll be separated that time and the time came do we graduated from the school and we separated our line and we are in the colleges and higher education some could not do that slowly separated again in the colleges in the university again a group of people but not that way as we were in the school then afterwards in their offices they're also the colleagues are their friends are there talking together but as because the profession so there is a distinct difference is always there friendship is there in the meantime we marry and we become that other people some people whom we never knew they become so close to us we say our relatives the husband the wife and their relatives they've also become it goes on changing but in every situation I think oh this is my situation this is mine isn't it but everything time it is changing all the time it is changing we cannot think that when it is stalled changing it is not the permanent why I am putting my mind and soul into it I am getting so much about thirst rate and they feeling pain if I am not having those things why but that is called this why will take you to the ultimate point where Sri Ramakrishna is telling leave on a test not that you should not feel for the frames not that we should not feel for the relatives family responsibilities love everything should be there but at the back of our mind it's all temporary that thought should be there it is all temporary and that is why I told this is the highest spiritual practice why I am Telling spiritual practice because this is a practice there's not the goal the wind that is also over it becomes normal natural then you become Jeevan Muktha so that is it says the effort to break the hypnotism I have this is my words is called the spiritual practice at the atomic sadhana this spiritual practice is nothing but understanding truth sathya which is eternal and anita on return means untruth which is temporary so what is this truth it is consciousness what is this untruth this world created world the truth and untruth goes in this way and what is this consciousness there's so many ways there open issues have tried to give the definitions and majority most of us who are the students of the Vedanta we know about it Britta Baranova Venetia I will quote it says a Sangha he I am pure shahe or Sangha without any company he I am he truly I am this Purusha the inner self the inner self the infinite entity is completely on a test or Sangha he I am Purusha purusa means that within inside pura Abbas theta/dt so that which is inside within the heart is the consciousness then obviously asanga he is completely detached that's the AMA Krishna said and he said very casually live unattached in the world if we can leave on a test in this world then there is nothing like that some people are trying to get the liberation they have understood the Foley all this nuisance of this world there is nothing nothing remains so constantly they are thinking to go beyond this and they are trying to go beyond this at the practicing yoga meditation and doing charity going to fill greement and practicing other austerities like fasting taking the name of God so many things they are doing why wanted to go beyond this but what is this if we don't understand where I'm actually going then it will be totally confusing that I was once when I first came 2013 it is very new to me this country and so big all this and and I I was going to the Dulles and there suddenly they announced the Dulles you know the pronunciation it was now I can stand but that time it was very difficult to understand the pronunciation particularly when they announce in the aircraft it's very difficult I don't know why they don't feel there may be some people who won't be able to understand if I am speaking in the casually or very local tone so they should win they're announcing they should feel that there must be other people so it should be slow and properly pronounced everybody can understand but anyway and they say Dallas Dulles and truly they were mentioning this is the stop from where they will go to Dallas I couldn't understand that was my first flight in America and I got down over there some Love Field or something like that and I went down and then went out and was waiting for the person and it never happens the devotees they always count earlier than before I reach over there then I was wondering why these people have not come the end suddenly I called to him and said said Swamiji it is not possible you are supposed to be here after another one hour you must have got done over there please go back all these things I had to wait for the next flight it was good the people are so good they helped me I got the another pretty the flight and then after two hours I did Stauber there so what is this just mystic and what is that mistake misunderstanding because I was not very much clear aware about my destination in the same way the spiritual life if I am not very clear about my destination what is my destination God what is God I don't know my guru knows okay my your guru knows that how it will go so you have to understand what is God actually I am trying to reach or I am going to be liberated what is that liberation so I should be we should be very clear about our destination first second the process to reach over there what did the process I am taking Salameh Krishna is very open very broad and he'll be advising us now let us conclude these only one sentence that he said leave unattached and what is this an attachment understanding what is the understanding this world is a mixture of consciousness and unconsciousness and I belong to the consciousness not to the unconsciousness and what is the unconsciousness in me this body and mind what is the consciousness the reflection that is coming from the supreme consciousness what is Brahman on my intellect my Budi so for that I should have to take and the booty the intellect dear I should utilize my knowledge which I which I get from the scripture and from my guru that this is nothing but the combination of truth and untruth and I should not take the untruth which is untruth which is temporary which is truth which is permanent this clear the what is permanent Brahman consciousness God that is permanent it can never change in any no in no condition it will change and when it is like that it comes along with that other things also how we will know the love will come unselfishness will come and you will feel so happy so that's why they say the it has the three things you will feel that you are not going to die your eternal only body will change your mind will change but you were eternal shut the cheat knowledge the giana the I am consciousness I cannot be bound by all these things that is coming before me so all the five objects that is there constantly becoming me calling me trying to attract me I said no thank you so that is second that is called cheat the giana and then on under refusing all those things which the other people considered the source of joy and happiness I am refusing that I am becoming very happy so these three things first is what cheat on on the bus that that is my goal I am clear about it and the process process awareness awareness awareness constantly I should say I am NOT going to the staple were there I know that that is a danger awesomer he I am barouche aha that consciousness which is within me at this moment it is reflection but through that reflection I can go to the original that is awesome unattached the consciousness is unattached so I should also leave unattached I should leave leave it everything but with an attachment and the it says the Shankaracharya miss Vivi actually he said Kannamma bandha what is this bondage atre a nominee a haamiti mati bandha this a not money the not Artman not conscious but I'm thinking this is conscious and that is called but I am super imposing I am thinking that this is the consciousness and by that way I am getting a test the conscious gist attached with the body the body means the I am a educated person and I am rich I am president of so and so like that all bodies but in reality is nothing so therefore we have to understand I am thinking those things if I say this shirt is me it's wrong it is not I'm just wearing it maybe somebody some other people can take it and then use it so I am NOT these I am just using it the same way the body I am so should be completely temporary and from that it comes me and mine this is mine and this is me and that is the Abunda now friends I will conclude quoting from a jeevan mukta gita there is a Gita called given without so many varieties of Gita the the jeevan mukti gita i'll quote from the one word from the jeevan mukta serum krishna when his telling leave unattached in the world and here the it says the jeevan mukta akaki rahmatan item sahara guna Birgitta ha brahma Jana rasa as Wadi Jeevan Mukta so chatty when I am living unattached as Saddam Oh Krishna said how it will be the jeevan mukti Gita says akaki alone but I am it so many so many frames and so many relatives and maybe some people don't like me that it also will be there some enemies but with all the challenges and with all the opportunities I am alone how it is I am alone I'm not attached to those when they are coming to me I'm just accordingly behaving when they're going away but that's all so Iike a key remote a nityam victim means eternally completely and he's enjoying rama rama ET the rod that is enjoying is not who i am alone there is no one and there's nobody to look after me constantly complaining when you are alone enjoy because that you are not alone you are in the whole world but an attached that is the training if one can take that there is no problem at all you are not depending on anyone that is the best training the Tres Ramakrishna said the greatest ease those who are in the household they need not to give up all those things and become a monk those who by the grace of God and there are some scholars their past deed in young age has become monk that is a separate group but majority of the people who are in this world and who became successful in their profit lives and there's now settle down and now thinking about the spirituality should adhere to this advice above ANSI Ramakrishna which he gave to Pandit give up mentally what attachment how I can give it that up I am doing I said this it must be done that ego should not be there I said if it is done it is good even it's not is okay first thing first practice is this giving up the ego slowly slowly and then leave unattached in this world the sand and the daughter and their grandchildren and all these property money slowly withdraw with all that it won't go with you you know very better that it's not going with you so why should I be attached so much and distributing my property whatever is necessary to my children if they need it if they don't need don't give rather give it back to the society give it a back to the donation give it to the poor people because you aren't from the society and give it back to the society if it is excess to you why unnecessarily when the children are not wanting it and they're sufficiently successful can maintain their own life why are necessarily giving it attachment don't do that so that slowly coming up no I got it from the society it's sufficient for me I don't need that much now so I give it back to the society society doesn't mean only my Keith and gain and my children Society mean other people also so Maya and daya this is Amma Krishna mentioned Maya you are doing the good thing but with attachment you are donating but with attachment you are giving your money to your Keith and kiemce attachment so there's called Maya but the same donation if you give to unknown people whom you don't know and not expecting anything back from them they are and that will give you the liberation so these are the two things a cocky remote a dictum Sahaba guna Birgitta what are the Sahaba guna those who are constantly attending these classes you are aware three gunas sattva Raja Tama and the are part and parcel of us because of the three gunas we are born the Sahaba guna susceptor AJ dama dama we are not because we have given up the Tama some portion may be there Raja is more a little portion of the set or try to be in the shutter and then give up so Sababa guna Birgitta then Bramnick Gianna raza us Wadi what is that brand monkey onerous enjoy or taste the Brahma Jana what is that I am Brahman I am Brahman I am Brahma Shankar Acharya many of you hard and you know the this body this mind it is not me it is not chewed on and the roof of shivoham shivoham that is brahma jana rasa sadi and the consciousness i am the eternal i am the police I leave all alone I am not depending on anybody else live in that way so that is called brahmic Gianna a sauce Wadi jibon looked so chatty when I meet with the frame or some neighbors I behaved very nicely properly talk to them concerned about them inquiring and always pray to God God now enough is enough whole world is suffering please do something so the people can become once again the normal so like that like I'm praying but at the same time I am completely unattached Brahma Gianna Russel Eswari Jeevan Mukta Jeevan Mukta is completely free by leaving free from what attachment and what is that attachment ego it is me so it is mine that ego is gone south jetty so sama Krishna said leave completely unattached that is the beauty of ceramic is nurse teaching he says things so simple but it is so deep as a profound now then he is telling Surendra wanted to spend the night over here as because the pundit said I want to give up and Sarang he is giving the reference but family told why should you spend the night so come back etc then he said what will you achieve by mere reasoning that is also very very important because when we reason reason reason it's very difficult there's so many fractions so many ways and so subtle it is is not easy ceramic richness a leave on a test we discussed almost half an hour on that particular thing reasoning now we are listening from him what you will achieve by mere reasoning be restless for God and learn to love him ready because we have the love we have the attachment see Ramakrishna is asking us to utilize those things those attachment that love towards God instead of loving other things are other beings towards God so he said become Restless for God sometimes some people I have seen when they can't talk to their children they become Restless the telephone is not working you know in India Bengal the ump on day that it was there now that all telephone connections I'm naturally to three days it was not there and people became mad and when it was a stole and what the government will do administration will do because to the nature so afterwards we need to us restore after one day or two days then the we asked I started receiving call and the complaint after complaint government is not looking after what the government will do government allows a human being but anyway they are fighting it is the nature is not so easy so obviously the devastating thing but people don't understand that my thing should be it always there but anyway now it has been restored people at to some extent happy but in the village side terrible condition and lot many people from different corners of the world are trying to help them they're sending whatever possible money to them so this is going on that this is called the restlessness we feel for God do you feel for that restlessness to God and the famous story ceramic each dimension is a story from the life of Jesus Christ the when Jesus Christ perhaps he was bathing in a river one person came and told how I will realize God it will ok now you have come here to be eight only yes go so he the moment he went down the water jesus old his head inside the water for some time when the man was struggling very hard for the year for the oxygen he released him he came up painted Jesus asked him how you were trying to get the breathing the year you should feel like that for God do you feel like that that means I am going to die without oxygen that should be the attitude I am going to die without God and those who have read the back of your Bhagwan see Ramakrishna you will feel see the picture over there how wonderful it takes it has been the depicted it has been mentioned the ceramic ISNA rubbing his face on the bank of the Ganga mother I couldn't see you I couldn't talk to you another day passed I do not know when I'm going to die so he's to get up early morning sometimes the whole 90 screen crying and praying so that is called earnestness so this is the way is mentioning the restless for God one must take of a definite attitude towards God Salaam o Krishna said knowledge now he is coming down for the people like us so we cannot constantly think oh I am Brahman am Brahman it is not possible you do be hypocrisy then I am having everything I am doing everything at the same time I am Telling I am Brahman that will be hypocrisy one should not do that those who have developed that very few you know all the sixteen disciples that ceramic kitchen was having only used to tell about the Advaita Vedanta to not endure not separately not before others used to take him inside the room close the doors and windows then used to say you are Brahman it's not for all all and just a hard about it now I am a scientist oh I am an engineer I am a I developed the software I can understand this better so I am having this I am having that wrong thing for that it is a complete different type of practice completely different like the Raman more she completely different attached from not attached to anything they only can practice it is not so easy so even the tided disciples of ceramic region of the great spiritual Giants so Cyrano Krishna told for you this is the devotion is the path what is the wrong nothing now I'm getting the same experience through devotion so the knowledge is fought those who can truly adopt it but here he says you must take up a definite attitude towards God then alone can one realize him first what is my goal God then what is my path devotion is good for me comfortably I can go because I don't have that strong temperament mentality to give up everything and constantly harping on that I am Brahman am Brahman am Brahman and not reacting to anything joy or sorrow there's a very typical part in the bhagavad-gita also it says the for the other people so good very broad way and that is called devotion and what had the attitude Rishi's like the sanaka cherished attitude of Santa the Shanta that is the attitude what is the shunt not reacting to anything so many things are happening all around they know that this is all the destiny going on happening I have nothing to do so they are constantly keeping themselves aloof just observer very typical again so this is Shanta so sanaka could do that sanaka sananda sanatana sanat-kumara these four brothers this to practice the Santa Baba Hanuman has the attitude of his turban dasya this Darcy attitude is very nice I am serving and becoming humble but at the same time I know that I can do it as educated and well-mannered and so all good things are there but at the same time completely humble and dedicated his god that his three Ramachandra parinirvana the Mojave Swami Vivekananda said the Mojave hanumana should be your ideal why he was having everything but no ego that is that the sudden doesn't mean the ordinary the people who are sorry not like that here the servant means he has dedicated everything at the feet of the God but he is really really capable person in everything utterly eatable Adama that it's about the Hanuman ji it says he is an extremely powerful person but he'll be sitting at the feet of the Sri Ramachandra his guru as if he doesn't know anything - like that hanumana the dasya attitude of the solvent the cowherd boy is a brindaban like Sri Dhamma and the Sudama the attitude of friend that's called Satya secure in Sanskrit means friendly attitude friendly attitude with God there's also beautiful that's so nice one American lady was there and she never took initiation from Swami Vivekananda but she is the person who averaged as she was connected to the very high society in America in those days and she is to organize all the meeting for Swami Vivekananda in different places and another high and powerful in the society they became a kind of amoeba Vivekananda because of the that American lady so stated I'm just this moment I am forgetting the my her name so that she organized everything but she used to say I'm the friend of Swami Vivekananda I am NOT his disciple since to go and sit on the bed of Shama Vivekananda when shall we become the passed away and we kept all these things still it is there in Baylor bar and she used to go and sit on the bed of this yarmulke Shama Vivekananda and nobody including shammy brahmananda and saladin and the neighbors said anything the understood the attitude was framed so that is exactly and when the young Swami's used to ask the man what is your age will usually people are not supposed to ask the age to the lady and but days to just to because she was very elderly that time and days to us ma'am what is your age and she used to say that this many year maybe six years eight years ten years like that are you so young yes I was born when I made sure me be wakened the day and the moment I met him I was reborn so I count my age from that day so that is the love that is the respect the complete dedication the attitude of a friend advising sharmaji guiding sharmaji helping sharmaji arranging everything as because she was well connected with the society in America Shami she got the great opportunity to move and spray the Vedanta so this is called Shakya then combats earlier but salute the Yashoda the attitude of your mother attitude of the mother that we mostly we know the mother when even they are talking they are constantly glancing to the the particularly if it's the baby is a young child constantly taking care of them the what they are doing where they are going fathers are not that way very much attached to the children but the mothers will constantly take care so the Krishna became the son of the Yashoda you showed that though Krishna showed are that he is the maker of the whole universe even them mother's heart and she used to feel that I should protect Krishna otherwise we will take care of Krishna because of that it is also another we are approaching to the God bars earlier and and the last one is Medora material harbor that Swami Rama Krishna said attitude of his sweetheart so that is Radha used to think the prisoner is her husband so she is to feel like that that that is the ways used to approach to Krishna so constantly loving like a wife to the husband and that is a wonderful love but not carnal love spiritual love only I love Krishna and Krishna should not be hard Krishna should not get any problem I should solve all problems whatever Krishna wants that I should give so that is the complete one-way love with the Krishna love me or not it doesn't matter and that is called la prema prema is one way that Swami Vivekananda said LOB's knows no butter butter means exchanging of things now I give you rice and you give me cloth not like that in olden days these two exchanged things that's called barter so love knows no barter so this is the ceramic is nice telling oh god thou art the Lord and I am thy servant that is the servants attitude a very good one for us parents telling all the five then he is mentioning the servant attitude is good for all of us humbleness but we know that with all the five attitude Serano Krishna himself added one more this is the traditional the devotion path Rama Krishna himself added one mode that the science attitude towards the parent the son attitudes toward the god the I am your son I am your daughter I am your child I don't care for anything and you should take care of me so the bots alia is the mother is taking care of the baby and the other the child depending on the father so that is that is what exactly what happened it says in this way the Rather's attitude and the krishna attitude of a mother salam o krishna added sounds attitude towards the god towards the father jesus said father he never said god he said my father and every time used to feel my father is taking care of me Salam o Krishna said mother because in India motherhood so their mother the same sad same consciousness the Jesus is telling at dressing as the father and cinema krishna's addressing as mother mother knows everything I don't know anything I'm not going to do anything mother will do everything like that like that today morning the one lady was talking and she was telling for anything I always talk to mother mother I like to do the japa I like that attitude she is praying to mother mother I like to do japa take the holy name of Bhagwan the God please help me to the physically and mentally I remain alert and good so I can take the name of God mother please see that my mind is not going anywhere else but to the God praying to the mother mother you should take care of all these and then whatever is happening mother why it is happening mother we need this gentleman is coming what he will ask I don't know please be with me constantly depending on the mother depending on the god and that is also wonderful attitude which Solano Krishna himself practiced and introduced but he didn't mention it over here he mentioned somewhere else then the pundit is leaving after the pundit left and it is from City citta means the other bank of the Ganga in one side the dictionary the other bank it was dusk Twilight hung over the Panchavati the temples and the river the master mache the he is giving all complete picture the world picture there beautifully describing the you can close your eyes and you can feel the darkness is approaching a little light is still there so that is the tree light and slowly slowly the pancha body the temple the river all are covering evening worship began in the different temples there are the Kali temple then the vishnu temple then the shiva temples that all the temples are having their poojas accompanied by sound of bells gongs consoles ceramic isne bowed before the pictures of the deities in his room he was sitting on the small couch in an abstracted mood a few devotees were on the floor there was a silence in the room so now see Ramakrishna's talking suddenly that environment change and our past ition and Kishori entered and sat down on the floor after saluting see ramakrishna mission was a great Ritualist he was devoted to the performance of the various rites and ceremonies prescribed by the Scriptures the master opened the conversation the ceramic Christians started talking with them can one attain knowledge of God by merely repeating the word God there are two indications of such knowledge now see we are reading the gospel which is full of knowledge now see Ramakrishna is giving the idea that one should live in this world completely unattached second he said if you cannot practice that through the path of knowledge which is very subtle that you have the opportunity to practice through the path of devotion so there are five we can say six approaches attitude towards God so God he is the creator and approaching him in this way but he said that you should have to understand when you are practicing how he will know that you were truly approaching to that truth approaching towards God you were really benefiting or developing spirituality now he says two things there are two indications of such knowledge trust longing that is to say love for God you may indulge in reasoning or discussion but if you feel no longing or love it is all futile as because this two gentlemen came the ceramic isne was talking to them one is a shun and Kishori this two and Master moshai he knew about them so he said ition was a Ritualist and he will be constantly observing many things first the Houma and then offerings and then the puja out so many it is there seems to do that ritual there's also a bad karma karma candy but Salaam o Krishna he's telling it is okay but do you feel yearning for God love for God if it is not then all that that you are doing is futile so this is one thing we should notice we are also taking the name of God but do you really feel love for God whatever little thing that we do we should feel oh I am doing it for the God sometimes we give gift to our friends and relatives the senior people and he gives so happily and when the person who is receiving the gift he also says oh good and I am so happy that you have given this we also feel very happy same way it should when we are giving something to God we should feel that God is accepting it and he is expressing I am happy it really happened so that longing should happen the you should feel within your heart that God is very happy I am doing it that is love the lab should be there otherwise taking the name of God or performing the yagya or reasoning nothing helps second the awakening of the Kundalini the whatever path the reasoning the devotion or the meditation Kundalini should rise as long as the kundalini remains asleep you have not at in knowledge of God that is the primal power that is the end of our the every humans that at the end of the spinal cord the Yogi's they say that power in a like a serpent it remains about there and when we are meditating slowly slowly it goes on coming up towards the head the first three stages are the below stages then it all spiritual actions revelation starts when it reaches the heart so that ceramic richness mentioning is the Kundalini as long as Kundalini remains asleep you have not attained knowledge of God you may be spending hours poring over books or discussing philosophy but if you have not the inner restlessness for God you have no knowledge of him when the Kundalini is awakened one attains Baba bhakti prema and so on this is the part of devotion this is the path of devotion the part of knowledge they don't meditate at all the only reason and they never get attached to anything this is completely that so it is so hard so difficult so subtle and not for the common people so this is the reasons Ramakrishna introducing that if you feel the longing for God love for God and your because you are constantly crying and crying Kundalini power will rise and when it reaches you find this thing baba bhakti prema and so on baba means completely absorbed in that God you feel the God is within you outside you are talking to God and at the time of sleep also you feel the God is present then the prema that is the ultimate that is as the only the Radha was having so in that prema is very very complete dedication it forgives the body even it is the ultimate part of karma is very difficult through each one obtains some powers I mean uncle power he's talking to that gentleman who practices karma that all the young young etc is very difficult a few occult powers it comes
