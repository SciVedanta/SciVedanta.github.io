[212: Panchama Veda 212: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANkY6YsIwz0)

good evening kavita kosh are seven among three Martin pavillon de Julio Jana Salaam business is today's the record is Monday September 29 1884 it was the third day of the durga puja i am reading from the Gospel of John additional 567 page the third day of Durga Puja the master ping a week in his room at the shisha since early morning the morning worship in the Kali temple was over and the orchestra had lived the morning melodies in the new Hobbit The Doors who doesn't know the system there was a special music room in every temple fiscal in Hobart in the north they still play the tune and obviously in the early morning so they played at the big temple that was the system and the brahmins and the girl gardeners basket in hand were plucking flowers for the worship of the Divine Mother paavo not Baburam Niranjan and in has spent the night at Dutch nation sleeping on the part of the Masters room as soon as they awoke they saw sri ramakrishna dancing in an ecstatic mood you can imagine then their just their sleep broke by seeing the bond in that divine mood and as soon as they awoke the sauce Adama Krishna dancing in an ecstatic mood he was chanting the tree to the mother Durga hallowed be the name of Durga it was the Durga Puja so he was full of Goddess Durga that spirit so white so many poojas and the Hindus first is the Hindu they understood that temptation of this world is too much and it was very difficult to resist the mind for the ordinary people from the temptation very very difficult even those who are striving to get the liberation even they sometimes leak from that to keep them at bay to make the ordinary people all the time reminding about the God and the divinity so many varieties of and also other things the included the ceremony so many varieties of ceremonies at least some portion of the mind would be thinking now we are going to that on the writing on the 17th in the noon time there is a program in the Hindu temple amount they are going to pour the water on the top of the temple so the Maha come home etc who will be attending that makes it on sixteen the evening we have the top 17th perform so some or other something or other they'll be organizing so that the people at least many many times they will go to attend that program and they will remember the durga puja five days pooja and all over the people ripen the poorest of the poor and the rich people also holy be in God and what is this dual caputure what is this Shakti or discussion will be there people will be reading and in environments that creates and the personalities like Bhagwan see Rama Tichenor with the gods in human form they also add into that so that particular time the people's mind automatically go out many of the hindus millions they will be studying the they will be practicing the Navaratri and also reading the holy books like sweet chutney and things goes on like that the serrano krishna he is adding in this way the devotees sat on their bail and with unwinking eyes was Ramakrishna's spiritual Hofstra was living at the temple garden we know about as those who are regularly following those afraid we know this person is trying to realize God he is living with the Living God Ramakrishna but unfortunately he was not understanding the truth this is very very unfortunate why ego what is this ego I know only this much was keeping hosta different from Sri Ramakrishna when the other people have coming taking his blessings and also following his guidance --is and becoming liberated hofstra living over there regularly so he'll come to that why so hosta was living living in the temple la - was also living there to render master the personal service Rahul was still at Randhawa nor indra visits ramakrishna now and then she was expected that t this is must immerse the so specific is very rare among the Indians the Indians they mostly describe the things had a philosophical way and interpretation but what is happening and why it is happening everything so categorically so this is that is why there is no doubt about the existence of ceramic dish now suppose someone at a time of Rama Chandra kept this record suppose someone at the time of other religious personalities kept the record mostly known about the Avadhuta with no record in some purana dimension and we are gazing there are a lot of opportunity to express doubt about their existences but this Ramakrishna where he understood it is a modern time so people will challenge so all these things in great details not in there was visiting now and then this is a word why master machine is mentioning because previously he never used to come and he was very close to the Brahma dramas now he slowly slowly understood that here I will benefit in my spiritual life the devotees wash their face the master took his seat on a mat on the north bar on de pavo not an aim sat beside him other devotees were coming in and out of the room if you have visited the destination you know that there are two three Doors actually salam distance rule there are three doors the people are entering now it is even even today from disco some people are entering that door they are going out so this was going on master to power not the truth is that ordinary mean cannot easily have faith but an assured cotys failed is spontaneous failed this is the word that most of the majority of the modern people doesn't know why failed those will come today who the faith means is a weakness without not knowing anything just someone said why should I have to believe so faith is a word all the time debating and in the modern days is too much Saddam Ashley here very clearly mentioning is sure Coty their faith is spontaneous those who know about the Eastern Coty who are the shisha cotys they are godly people they have already realized God but still they have taken birth only to help the other people you know that sometimes too premature is came to join in advaitha strong I was also a Brahma journey but a little senior so the singer strongly actually in Jeremy asked me to take them to build more to introduce the other senior Swami's like the president Mirage I suppose it is that the tradition you are supposed to go these two they were coming from a place where they never knew that one should go and touch the feet of the senior Swami's they just bow like this and there so I took these Brahma charities and everywhere they were bowing I was touching the feet of the other Swami's but they didn't follow me they were by wound like this the other Swami's didn't say anything the president Mirage and others when I took took pain - from a position on the G he was the vice president and they also Doug did like that from eg and they have newly joined in a Drita's done I have brought them over here to introduce with the balloon mod the headquarters and to also to introduce the senior Shani's they bow immediately mutation on the G told me in Bengali you show how to respect the senior Swami dental problem then I told them follow me then I did touched my forehead at his feet and with at all respect they also did that so this is how we have to some people should behave those who are devotees close to the organization and the Swami's they should behave in such a proper manner so the other people knew people didn't learn from that and it sure could is a just like that he should go teach they are coming with a complete failed because they are realized Souls there is no doubt whether God is there or not all these things are over and that is the reason they come to support the incarnations the manifestation of God in the human form we call in condition and these all they come to support him so the ordinary people also can follow that will they develop the faith so here he is telling their faith is spontaneous hustla can never be persuaded to believe that Brahman and Shakti that Shakti and the being endowed Shakti are one and the same the Hofstra as I will never believe it Raghavan Serrano Krishna is expressing these is a wonderful philosophy that he is introducing the philosophy of pure art WETA the everything that consciousness but we cannot deny this moment the external world simply because then someone said that there is no world as we are studying now the Avadhuta Gita a Buddha is telling there is nothing but me but that is for a Buddha ashtavakra Sunita nothing is the air for a struggle but whatever dollars we have to reach to that height but before that we know that we had to follow the steps with the our more ferocious the greed souls they have followed the cinema Krishna has come to help us understanding the different levels of minds and people he is giving us this instruction what is this instruction he's telling look at it hustla can never be persuaded to believe that brahman and shakti those who have studied the Vedanta and also following the words of the once the Ramakrishna you know the one is Shakti the power of God power of Brahman through which the Brahman the supreme Brahman is manifesting or creating this world how he's creating it from his own ship T and this ship T has been turned in many different names hidden in the garbha they saved on what is that here another saying the brahman which is completely absolute he has created this world we should not mix up the pure or treating approach where they say there is known nothing is there the goal of the carica is since there is nothing and similarly ashtavakra samhita similarly the Buddha they are all see like that because they have reached over there and that is the truth we should not mix that now to explain and to understand what is this chugga what is this universe where from it came from the drum money and how brahmand did it through its power and this power is known as Shakti power actually in Sanskrit Shakti what is that power desire the Brahmins desire in the bather itself it is mentioning it's not that someone of the Shankar Acharya he just introduced that not that it is in the beta that one he wheezed that which means the desire what is the desire and one I like to be meaning now every question why he thought like that there is nonsense the Supreme Being in his mind there is a wave game I am gone and I like to be Meany while he thought like that you cannot ask the question the ABS absolutely but the thing is this the creation to explain the creation it must be like this and when it was that the shifty the power it is there it is existing how we know this our thoughts I am thinking first my desire is coming then the planning and then the execution the Brahmin also thought in that way some people won't accept it there is nothing wrong as I was mentioning again and about those and others they didn't accept that but their stand is completely different not Raja Raja Raja is very low level and he is thinking also many other things but at the same time he is arguing why I am speaking so much time to explain this because some people in the name of Advaita Vedanta they always say this world is not there anywhere so I need not to do anything but in the morning is running for the office because he has to earn money if it is so this is completely wrong you have to understand your condition and then only you can stop otherwise it will be hypocrisy I say something and I do something I understand something I practice something that is the reason only this line we should understand very carefully and this is not only we are making mistake be Hara and hasta was not not that his soul he was also we talk amongst Ramakrishna that means he has done something very good otherwise how it is possible to leave its Ramakrishna this is the reason we have to understand we ever came in contact with Raghavan's the Ramakrishna only to explain the truth for the ordinary people then and afterwards this Hodja is an example of a doubtful personality like us so we are not expecting so ceramic Asian is telling that being endowed with Shakti are one and the same when the reality appears as creator preserver and destroyer we call it Shakti when it is inactive we call it brother this is round and if you go to any other book it will be so difficult to understand this simple thing and so easy this Ramakrishna is daily why because he he has not studied this he realized that so from the realization when he speaks is completely simple and truth those who cannot that means they are going on describing it using different terminologies and the language is so wonderful they go on and on because they have not understood that so that is the problem those are understood whole thing it becomes so easy to see Ramakrishna is telling the fire naturally brings to mind is power to now he's giving the example he said the same thing the Brahmin when active we keep the name Shakti and when inactive on the basis of this truth only they have developed the Kali and the Shiva Shiva inactive Brahman Kali active Brahman there is no difference now he is giving the example he is giving the fire the moment you say fire naturally we know the power to burn and the idea of burning naturally bring to mind the idea of fire it is impossible to think of the one without the other look at the simple way is explaining so this two are there one is the action the activity another is the source of that so I pray to the divine mother Oh mother Raja is trying to upset the views of this place this bismuth lamb dish now he never said I place now he is prayer located his brain to whom his bring the divine mother who is this divine mother Shakti the Shakti of o brahmana so he is praying to the Brahmin when it is active so that strengthens the Ramakrishna said whenever you are praying praying to the Shakti into the brain to the of course Ramakrishna but at the same time if you pray to the mother you get the answer very quickly your prayer will be answered by the ma the problem will be solved with a model y the same Brahman same God but the Shakti the power from where he is working so he said I pray to the divine mother Oh mother hasret is trying to upset the views of this place either give him right understanding or take him from here so very clear the next day he came to me and say yes I agree with you why see Ramakrishna is giving this example he is giving that if you pray to the divine power your prayer will be answered this is the healing in this way and yes I agree with you he said that God exists everywhere as all-pervading consciousness no doubt it's okay Babu not smiling Bravo another young boy he was a friend of narendra not so naturally he is a Jew was also at that time 1819 did what hostages say really make you suffer so much Johanna who is also very intelligent so you are praying to the divine mother that either you take away the webinars or change his mind is it so important to pray like that master you see I am now in a different mood here also we should understand I cannot shout and carry on heated discussions will be I am NOT in a move now to our and porn with Ezra the hustler will pick up a discussion and very hard discussion Hofstra is a book leading Salaam o Krishna is a realization and Ezra will be quoting from the Veda Upanishads Saran Tichenor will be telling from his own realization the simple way the truth hasta I know I said to me at Joe luminex garden house uncle don't want to keep me with you you know that this this boy the young man this retired the one is Ezra another is reader he that was his nephew huge to serves Ramakrishna in a personal way and Serrano Krishna wins and used to schools Ramakrishna Lord frames but most of us we have read the biography of Saddam additional you know the contribution of the gridiron fish to serve Dhamma Krishna and slow is slow least Ramakrishna became known to the the people of that society and high-enriched people started visiting him now ceramic dish that was not at all paying any he who is coming and not the heart that he died on he became egoistic he started thinking all these rich people are coming and they are coming and asking him morning can I talk to surround Krishna can I go inside the room when he'll be free so he is now the secretary and secretary is more powerful than the boss and Saddam Krishna says I will go there and as I started controlling him they are sorry this is Utah Aramis started controlling him then one day so happened is I went too much and ceramic is now worshipped masa da da money Debbie and to impress the new boss this Asylum worshipped the daughter of that landlord the son of mathura and he was very angry without the permission why you have watched with my daughter and they were afraid if you are worshiping the daughter maybe that she won't be able to have the normal life so naturally he was angry and told her that go away from here saddam didn't didn't say yes unknown this is also a teaching when we are with the religious people the person who is serving the pearl the religious man should be very very careful why the different type of things come and mostly those who are very closed to start thinking that I am doing it that ego takes them completely away from God away from the divine life so one must be very careful when Saddam Oh Krishna is mentioning that reader I said to me at jutsu monix garden house kid I was not allowed to enter into the the campus compared that a place abduction issue but jutsu Malik was the neighbor Saddam occasion was visiting that house and this boy the young man came and told uncle don't you want to keep me with you no I say it's wrong business stealing no I am no longer in a mood to get into heated argument with you so this is what's a ramakrishna his mood has completely changed the time if we see it is 1884 and 1886 Salam Krishna will give up his body so it is no time for him to argue and to pursue and to make them agree he understood that were the only two years to organize a wonderful mission train these young boys the pure hearted soul and I should help them to realize God so that afterwards they can continue without me so keeping the mother the divine mother not sort of the money they'd be over-the-air but in those days you have to remember it is 18th century 19th century beginning so obviously in that society Indian society the women were not getting that respect so keeping the mother as the head it was difficult two years not in renard and he was only a young boy of 20 and all around him was all senior people to Rambabu and others the ceramic isne was trying to develop that and slowly slowly he was giving lot of importance just before others also to not in the now so they understood not in the nod is not ordinary because the master himself is giving so much another expecting him that he we create soul with that way the Lord in that form was slowly making the mission now he is telling what is that our subject today what is knowledge and what is ignorance he is asking this question what is knowledge and what is ignorance then he said a man is ignorant so long as he feels that God is far away and this is roundish them so simple the ignorance and knowledge but mostly in the very first pages of this gospel we know the ceramic issue is asking the same question to the recorder master Marcia now what about you why is he that and master maasai say in those days the girls were not attending the school's who is she is a good lady ignorin and Saddam additional rebuked him and you are at the matter of knowledge and why because knowledge and ignorance means one who understand a reality God is a person whom can be saved as a man of knowledge and if not ignored so Saddam occasionally a man is ignorant so long as he feels that God is far away he has knowledge when he knows that God is here and everywhere very simple two sentences if you think that God is far away you are an ignorant person and if you can understand and feel that God is here and everywhere then you're a man of knowledge this much and nothing else when a man has true knowledge he feels that everything is filled with consciousness and this is English cinema Krishna was arguing and not only that he was praying to the divine mother to prove the hasta either he should be here or go away to accept the consciousness when active is Shakti the hostler admitted but the same sonication is now telling what is the knowledge true knowledge he feels that everything is filled with consciousness filled with consciousness so this is called the true knowledge in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna is mentioning you mom BT dr. de you the one BT mom Big D they know me Tata Tata truly what is the truth he is this in this form as Sri Krishna and also as consciousness everywhere but unfortunately majority of the people who are following Sri Krishna they don't give the importance to the second part so Krishna in this form is God that much and they will never be see the other temples they'll never accept other gods and goddesses they'll never allow people to visit and all these things the narrowness and they're closing all the and windows but what is the second part Tata Tata what is that tattwa I am everywhere if he is everywhere the same God is everywhere in every being how can you say no to that person so this is true Hinduism friends just a little that in this discussion knowledge what is that knowledge the consciousness everywhere this is just because someone said and we have to accept it no in but you know that there are six systems of Indian philosophy and each and every system of Indian philosophy they have made thoughts to prove I will only code from the pedantic philosophy and how they prove the truth that consciousness is everywhere they reach to that truth truth six difference method and if you are interested to know in details a little tough philosophy but you will really enjoy the reading if you love the philosophy Shawny shot Prakash on unders the book made thoughts of knowledge it is available in our bookstore methods of knowledge every page you have to read two three times and slowly slowly you will be understanding different terminologies and he will understand arguments there we find it or tweet Vedanta they are accepting the sums they say only three mostly the tree and somes the only two but are do it we don't accept six system three six the ways to understand truth first is partial protection perception now the person's perception is having the two different ways one external and internal perception what is the external way of perception through our five senses we we go and touch we see we smell we taste and we understand these this is a perception we also feel loved we didn't go and touch a see but he feel love or hatred joy sorrow where he feel there is also knowledge there is also perception someone will come hey what happened to you now he insulted me I he didn't beat you he says something but the man who is insulted he knows the pain inside other people may say something but the man the person who has been insulted he can understand what is the pain inside so there is also perception so the perceptions are of two types external and internal this it is called protection I am NOT going to explain it here maybe some other time an opportunity comes then inference on umana on amana we know that through the inference we are sitting inside and we see that all the trees are moving we can understand there's a strong wind blowing we are not we can understand that sitting inside the room and all windows are closed but we can say there is a great wind blowing outside how inference what is the inference the trees and branches they are moving violently that means strong wind is moving then the shutter the shutter the barber and that is beta this hour without the velocity the extra peter me of the assist system they don't accept only buchumi bongsa among sure are the Vedanta the active beta we talk about Veda but at the same time we must know many and other philosophy do not accept this is why should we accept that somebody said no we must realize so but be done to accept the Baader who are these after Barker these are the terminologies after after means realized soul when a realized person says like this then we must accept it this is after work then boom on comparison when it compared that we come to that resolution all that truth yes it is possible when you have comparing and from the comparison also the knowledge dawn another is presumption are tar pahty or postulation this the terminology used a presumption are tar pahty and non apprehension anupalabdhi this is also pramana this is also prominently now the last one I do not see over here the person I was wanted to talk I was thinking to talk this also pramana that he is existing suppose II I was thinking that he will come and I will talk with him I said no he's not here this he is not here or no pull up thing I didn't see him over here also another type of pramana proof that he exists so that's one day in Bombay one of our Swamiji was giving a talk then one person stood up and say can you prove that God is here well why not I can prove now please sit down and tell me is there a cow inside his all he said no how do you know because I know the cow that is the reason now you say there is no God right that means even though God I will go and touch your field because he realized sword he said no whether you it proves that proves mean when you see there is no God that means you have the conception of God and you know who is God and you can be certain to say not here as you are certain to say no cow is here in this assembly because you are certain you know what is called so to see there there is no God also pramana anyway so these are the ways by which we can understand that there is consciousness there is God this is just a passing remark Huzur entered the room and sat down the master topped a while above different things and then he said to Hara you see many people we're at the wrong house yesterday which I cater and others were there but why did I feel so deeply stirred at the site of Narendra I found that cater belong to the realm of divine inebriation as I was telling he is introducing Narendra with the devotees there was not much time left only two years not even complete two years the God knew it the avatar a barista he knew it he knew that I have to make a leader so he was introducing Narendra so many people were there but I thought only about Narendra why it is so this proves that marine three is having something which God appreciate so afterwards there is no hesitation to accept Narendra not only that to make it confirm almost before his death time he wrote with charcoal Noreen she kdb northern will teach the whole world joke on Cory by the rock the way when we will explain this eternal religion in the outside and inside inside India and outside India exactly that happened Noreen she KDB he will teach the whole world and this everything he is making the plan that a great movement will start dreams don't think here is a baton to society there is a burden to society this Swami that shown a knot like that is a great movement which was started by the God himself in the form of bonds ramakrishna which was nurtured by God's power marshal of the Munni Devi and another the gods another form shown in Vivekananda there are all disciples of ceramic Asia then how come that we are only keeping sharmaji because Raghavan see Ramakrishna he gave his Jaffa mala the rosary his counting beads to the mother after worshipping her what and then he offered it to marshal at Imani Devi and pray to the divine mother who was himself he prayed to the divine mother please enter into her person and manifest that divine power so that through hard millions will gained the liberation this time and he entered the god himself is power entered into the person of Salah Shama Vivekananda the young man he was sitting at little distance and looking at see Ramakrishna who was in his death paid certainly not Indra observed that elliptic current is coming from ramakrishna to him entering into him and he shouted as because he was studying in English so obviously the English came fast he shouted no the whole band entering to me look look the same old man entering into me and in that under the law he said no the old man poetic English no the old man entered into me when Saddam edition is saved what you are talking about don't you do you think I don't understand English I know that what you were tailing then he say now I gave everything to you so this is Ramakrishna again in another form show me BB calendar and March are the Munni Devi the power of God now these three this started a movement that's no no don't make the mistake this time this is the power this is the way and it's going to cover the whole universe and what is that love and unselfishness complete self-confidence without ego these are the movement it's not I am the Hindu and I am going to grab or ceramic richness should be the God no no no no not like that we never talked about Saddam can have you ever heard our song is talking about Saddam or Krishna only once in a year when you celebrate the birthday of Saddam additional then only we talk to our devotees that - for one or two hours that's all we talk about began the villa's offering the banana is nothing failed some confidence I can do I can do as family say those who are not having the confidence they are not believing God through the self confidence that is the dominant philosophy and leaving these if we go to this man that man okay there's no problem visiting is alright but know that the true knowledge is here if sincerity if you are really nearly sincere to know about the spirituality don't leave these opportunity the Salam o Krishna he is now telling the math master looked at him certainly when went into Samadhi shut when this talk was going on suddenly not in the knocking and he saw that there is a madness printed the other devotees are supposed to come and see it but this young boy came and in those days they used to mostly come walking he was tired he lied down over there the moments young Krishna saw him immediately we went into Samadhi and Robin are the friend of Narendra he sang Oh mother even blissful as thou art do not deprive die worthless child of please in Bengal it says ma Ananda Mui oh ma nirananda Karuna don't make me the sad because you are my mother the ceramic isne again came down from the samadhi and he was talking he said to hustla was sitting on the northeast verandah counting the beats of his roomie another thing that we should understand after the realization of God and continuous remembrance of God you don't need special time or the system to meditate and take the name of God this continuous spontaneous hasta was calling on God master waned and sat in front of him taking the rosary in his own hand he took the rosary in his own hand master to hasret you see I cannot use the rosary no perhaps I can yes I can reply left and see rosary is supposed to count in the right hand she took it in the left hand okay let me try but I cannot repeat the name of god with it with these words ceramic is not tried to perform a little Jaffa but hardly ready began when he went into Samadhi this is teaching ceramic listener is giving the teaching through words and also with his behavior so when you were reading the gospel of Salaam o Krishna we here in talking and at the same time thanks after Masha he so nicely depicted the whole picture we can visualize what is happening that's why I always feel most of you have you go to India if possible received oxygenation and bellomont come on oh good geometries or places the part place of ceramic is nur Maharaja and also the divine play that happened Daksha nation also in balloon model Shami Vivekananda's bad place now in Calcutta itself not very far from middle part so you can go over there and all the other places and if you go after reading these the moment he will enter immediately will remember oh this thing happened over here etc and Saddam Oh pish 'no he was sitting there took the rosary wanted to take the name he couldn't why how long one practice once you realize God you are God you need not do now suppose shall I go on telling oh he shot man and a shot man I don't Miami shot man under I am NOT going to talk take my own name those who are talking about me other people they mentioned my name not me just like that when we realized God we become God's ourselves we need not to take our own name because it is already done it is complete then why all these Swami's the great souls that I rape disciples of Sri Ramakrishna this to practice meditation because the joy in going back to your own self going back to your own self you have to as long as the body is remaining you have to live in this world talking with people behaving just like that many any other feeling hungry feeling sleeping at the moment you meditate you go back to your own self that is completely different completely completely different that is the ceramic history is showing he sat in that state a long time still holding the rosary in his hand all were still sitting on the veranda when suddenly Prabhu not appeared in the garb of a Brahma child the another scenario the people they were there there's a young boy not in the knots frame he went inside somewhere he got Akira and he dressed himself as a brahmacari with a kamandalu the water can that usually the sannyasis the carry and he came people naturally like that dress he dressed an ochre cloth come on to new in hand his face brimming with smile the young boy making fun monster with a smile the Hat is his inner feeling his feeling joy as a Brahmachari that means he wants to be a Brahma Jerry wants to be a practitioner in spirituality therefore he has dressed himself as a drama check then not anger a casual remark master which is depicting all this thing when you look at Vivekananda we think Vivekananda but see he was just like ours the my friend is doing something I also feel like so he nor Indra commented he has put on a garb of a brahmacari let me put on the garb of a tantric worshipper the tantric means the rate Club kosnov was there has recommended jokingly then you would have to follow the tantric ritual which we main wine and so on Salam Krishna didn't like see the mind immediately coming down when we are discussing about some higher thing if someone comment like this immediately the whole thing breaks down Salaam Krishna did not encourage the conversation instead he waned completely in other discussion we will discuss about that heart words and a monk was there but he was very short-tempered and how Salam kitchen is behaving with them that this is how we should learn the okay flow up to this in the next Tuesday again limit need and yellow medium on until town come back Drita be gone by he saw Atari but a Misha medium-term Ramakrishna shirasaka shanti shanti shanti hurry you that said Sri Ramakrishna Horeb animus to the other day one family game has been
