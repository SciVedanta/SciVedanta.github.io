[95. Panchama Veda 95 :Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_Tg--Nuyk)

co bvy ritam calm asabam savannah mangalam srimad otha tom boonen te borre dodgin aha bhagavan sri ramakrishna like the traditional veda the storehouse of spiritual knowledge instructing very clearly and emphatically renunciation and discrimination are the only two process only two practices which can take us to God realization now the question is why we are studying the gospel of sri ramakrishna it is not a storybook this is a book of knowledge what type of knowledge spiritual knowledge how to get their spiritual knowledge only by two things to practice what are the two things all the scriptures they said and Sri Ramakrishna also emphatically he is mentioning renunciation and discrimination these are the two words tiada and Beach Ala renunciation is the alga what we are to tell renounce and that is our desire to have this worldly temporary things this is very clear now some people when they talk and when they ask questions like if we are not working properly if you are not having the desire then where will be the world that is not your problem world will be the your problem is are you happy in these worldly things if you are happy then the spirituality is not for you and but if you think that this cannot give me the permanent satisfaction permanent joy permanent peace then this book see Rama Krishna and his advisors are very very essential in our last discussion we have hard when the people are asking that the page of the book is 200 48 49 50 we are reading the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna translated by Nikhil analogy and here we have already read those portion discussed over that and we found that people are asking who are those people householders because the particular chapter is with the devotees at dakshin Asia so in the dictionary see Ramakrishna he is discussing with the devotees and they are asking sir can one realize God while leading a life of a householder very specific question can one who is leading a householders life also realized God monks at the great Souls the announcers they can but when I am in this worldly life I have some responsibilities I am performing my duties can I to realize God another is asking what is the way said what is the way and third question he found can anyone lead a spiritual life while performing duties as a householder not this specific question he has said in a different way I didn't find anyone in this worldly life in this world who is advancing in the spiritual life etc etcetera there that actually he is what asking this question wanted to know these what is that can anyone leading a spiritual leader spiritual life while performing duties as householder now the question answers of avance ramakrishna that we find very simple answers but very to the point very specific those who are really interested in spiritual life instead of reading thousands of books and getting confused if we read these and then concentrate and practice then the goal is so easy for us now see Ramakrishna is telling do your duties in the world fixing your mind on god do your duty is not asking yogurt anita the vedanta body in there telling ya got an idea it is totally temporary this word is temporary the parantha is they say the Buddha stuttering full of misery this world is full of misery and then see Ramakrishna is telling no no you be there whatever duties you are performing you perform whatever the profession you have practice that you also can continue but only one thing perform your duty is fixing your mind on god now the question is what is God the highest form of morality and what is the highest form of morality is pure unselfish love and why should I or how can I love each and every one and unselfishly because I see divinity within them so that is the ultimate thing the bell antha says each and every soul is divine and that devotee says each and every soul is nothing but the manifestation of my God my God has taken this form my god has taken that form that is a devotees way but they seek god only and be daunting he sees Othman the soul the Brahman presents in every being whatever it may be but the thing is they see God and then they start loving them serving them unselfishly without any motive when we are serving someone if you have some motif that is not the spiritual way without any motive without any expectation expectation of whatever the support or the appreciation or money our position nothing just service for service sake so that you do your duties in the world fixing your mind on god the fixing your mind on god means this i have to always constantly think that within me God is there and without also outside also God is there and when I am traveling when I am seating thing I am lying when I'm alone when I'm in the work when I mean the company for a second just close your eyes and try to imagine within your heart the God is society he is sitting he is waiting he is listening he is taking the food that's all and we'll come to that sadhana what is that certain of this so this is the very simple way so this of bhagavan sri ramakrishna stilling do your duties in the world fixing your mind on god practice of the presence of god constantly constantly presents of God go to solitude but how to do that then the second step he is telling go to salute you and observe your mind you have to spend a few days in solitude he is giving this stress on that you have to spend a few days in solitude suppose two three days we go maybe in America here in Chicago we have Ganges retreat anyone can approach us and we can give the permission they can go and stay and suppose it goes and think that two days i am not going to talk to anybody not over phone not over anyone discussing simply or all alone two days mon up brother the silence I'll practice I will eat the one time or maybe twice or just go on reading books meditating anyone can practice it and that way he will understand the solitude he can understand the power of solitude the wonderful way the mind is changing only one or two days you have to spend a few days in solitude not that in continuously go and to this pain and come back and hang about another two three months afterwards again you go again you practice like that like that like that and that gives a wonderful calmness in the mind when you are totally alone when you are left to yourself when you are only talking with your own mind when you are observing your mind and your company is nothing but god the holy books and different wonderful spiritual lives that you are reading getting the inspiration what happens then mind becomes perfectly prepared for the journey towards God develop strong spirit of annunciation give up at once with determination so the third how fast you what you say yes you can realize God why not but do your duties in the world but keep your mind constantly attached with God remembering God first second due to solitude and observe your mind is it tranquil is quiet it is very very agitated constantly and what for the agitation what the mind is thinking that you observe your mind and quite endowed one of one or two days then he's telling developed a spirit of renunciation what is the spirit of renunciation I have caught I have house I have family I have frames I have relatives and I have position in his world now suppose you go into solitude and just observe what how things are moving you will find that without you everything is moving nicely and there is no problem and sometimes only when you come back the people will say the what happened I didn't see you there that much then if you ask them whether you missed me oh no I was so busy I couldn't remember you but anyway is good that you are here now so that is exactly that constantly we find that that renunciation whether I'm here or not it doesn't matter at all and if it is matters then also it is temporally after few days we words I am going to pass away that is sure maybe today maybe after hundred years but I won't be here renunciation then with a determination so that much only I need what only for my survival I sleep because I have developed some habits because my lifestyle is like this suddenly I cannot leave and in Austria life like that so all these things are necessary but that much only I am NOT hankering for anything else so that is he says third and fourth in the Osterberg crush on meter also it says moksha Bashara Boris IAM Banda wish I aku rasa eita body big yanam jettison chassis Tatar kuru gotta eat chassis Tatar guru Yetta whatever eat chassis you are desiring that are that guru you do you do are you practice whatever you want but before that too only two things you must know what is that desire for worldly things is bondage moksha be Shia virus IAM moksha be Shia virus IAM be sharable ostium desire for worldly things is bondage y banda be sure your boiler some banda that be sure that that thing that when the moksha liberation we don't want what do you want be sure and if we want that that is the bondage this is one thing we want the worldly things but that is a bondage what's type of bondage because again and again i have to come back to this world this temporary world the constantly changing world and i have to go through all the six changes jayati st birth at the pepperoni Emotiv EPOC Ciotti bria tea and born and growing up and slowly decaying and one day depth that inevitable each and every one has to pass through this six changes that is fixed and the ostrava crush on me toaster dr. Mooney he is mentioning atha body Berbick yanam these if you can understand if you can know this if you can remember and that is called science with gaanam spatial knowledge vicious gianna with gianna special knowledge what is the special knowledge that if my mind goes to the worldly things then I am bound and I have to come back again and again to fulfill my desire and for that another desire will arise I'll going on in that circle this is one and second if I can renounce that then I get mukthi to the renunciation see Rama Krishna is talking about renunciation and austere of acrimony he is also supporting these this is then if you understand this then you do whatever you like no problem if you have formed on that particular knowledge which is called big Jana and then you can go anywhere you can do anything in this world you are not bound because in your subconscious mind you are always alert that things should not bind me I will ever do anything or thinking so that thoughts those thoughts which can bind me ultimately so always alert see ramakrishnan is in his own world khatta meetha he is telling in Bengali Audrey to be on a chilly BTW jata it cha Tata jo Etta each other wherever you want Tata ja you go but before that you die the null Jawad duita what is the knowledge of what Drita everything is nothing but the manifestation of the same God same Brahman i am brahman and everything is the same that oneness the knowledge of oneness if you are happy then you go you're free nothing can bind you and that's why he used to tell again and again about Narendra 17 18 years young man whatever want he wanted he wanted he did see Ramakrishna was very much conscious and he used to tell others you should not do this you should not do that but about Narendra new esprit why naturally contemporary people this to feel jealous ceramic ishness favoring narendra not ours that goes then see Rama Krishna told that the knowledge fire of knowledge is burning within his heart nothing can bind him wherever he is whatever he is doing nothing can bind him because that knowledge is already there we heard from the estaba cremini desire for worldly things his bondage and desire free is freedom and that is called moksha knowledge of these is science understand and leave your life now this is in support of the ceramic richness that that suggestion discrimination now in the fourth way he is telling practice of discipline is absolutely necessary discipline is absolutely Nasri why shouldn't a man succeed if he practices sadhana now God himself Ramakrishna himself is God he is telling if you practice sadhana how come that you will not succeed in realizing god the great the wonderful words encouraging words those who are really cincy when they read these they get all impetus encouragement the opportunities that their chances are there wow what I have to do who par sanam I have to practice spiritual austerities that's all but this is he is telling discipline and this is very very important what is the discipline what does it mean by discipline discipline means we have to fix up a time this time I am going to get up this time I am going to sit for meditation this time I am going to d's it good all these all through so if we practice that discipline constantly and there are many ways we will come to that barsana that is again the roster Buckra that he is telling the coop asana how one should do and you will understand why see Ramakrishna is giving so much of stress the first he said do your duties and fix your mind on god secondly say go to a solitude and try to understand yourself and you must go he is giving the impassive you have to spend a few days in solitude develop strong renunciation give up at once with determination what you know to be unreal at once you should give up then he said practice of discipline is absolutely necessary why shouldn't a man succeed if he practices sadhana and then finally he said have failed have faith means wish wash with Josh Bashar have faith faith in what in the words of the Wannsee Ramakrishna faith in what whatever he said have faith in that and practice see the result have faith what is the trait again that I am divine and that is exactly we are going to realize what is God realization nothing but to know that I am God myself and here i am divine and to prove that saddam o Krishna is narrating a beautiful story from the life of Veda Vyasa we know that the vasa at the farm conviction that it was not himself but Narayana God who dwelt in his heart partaken of the food the ladies of the village when they wanted to cross the river they they were not getting the boat so they came to the Vyasa who was sitting by the shore of that and told said you have lot of power we know supernatural power yogic power can you please help us then he told them give me some food they gave lot of food he ate everything then he said going near to the river please give them a way if I have not eaten anything if that is very peculiar this moment the man is eating and then next moment he is telling if I have not Lucy Ramakrishna is concluding he was four month at knowledge is not me but the Narayana the God who is dwelling within me he is eating so that is called faith complete faith God is residing within me if that I cannot do anything wrong I cannot think wrongly I cannot do anything wrongly I should not practice anything which will harm others I should not think anything which will harm others because I am God myself and all that I see is nothing but the manifestation of the same God so that is called faith we should have to have that faith now the OPA shonna the Ramakrishna said if you have the discipline in the pancetta she the dhianna diba 142nd sloka it's a parson hacia sama thought beat dog potty Babbitt taught aha OOP asanas here some are thought to practice sadhana loop Hashanah we need mental power and one should pray to God to get that power to otherwise we will never think or neighbor could imagine that we will do that maybe one day I will do and then next day I cannot why the gods grace is not there to practice continuously the inspiration that is also necessary that's why in the bhagavad-gita II find that the Krishna is telling Arjuna but the Yoakum the gamma I give them that inspiration that thought that all these things he is not the contingent ours ours giving us that inspiration so to practice that even is necessary the blessings of God and then what is it true spiritual practices knowledge of Brahman dawn in heart through that practices pancetta she is a book of knowledge parson Arceus armor thought bit dotty Bavetta by the personal by practicing regularly that some people they come and say can you please tell us what is going to change after take initiation and nothing nothing is going to change at least not immediately but if you are practicing it continuously for a long time with faith then you will find the change within yourself and what are those changes that the wonderful broadness will come catholicity will dawn in your heart and you can see things properly understand things properly so all these good qualities that has been listed in the bhagavad-gita will slowly slowly you will find within yourself and know for sure that God realization is very near because all those good qualities are already coming and cleaning your heart how it was possible as we take the medicine we do not understand how the medicine is working the similar way it regularly we are going on taking the name of God that we publish it all from this belong to society we publish our so-called calendar and the calendar there the last 2015 calendar it is on our Raja Maharaj from Margie and in the Brahmin on the G Scott a shin and wonderful pictures it has been collected and in this month in November if you open you will see practice practice practice japa japa japa constantly why is teaming because he knew that only by taking the name of God everything will happen but you have to have faith only three days I practice and I come back and say why nothing is happening that don't do whether it is going to happen or not doesn't matter I have faith in the words of these great Souls I have faith on my guru so whatever he said that mantra I will go on trip repeating that's all so that OOP asana that summer thumb and that summer thought with that power of barsana bit potty what is the big day brahma gana and vedanta sutra OD curran it says is giving one after another how one should practice soup asana a prion etre p he Tristram practice spiritual austerity till you get liberation how long one should practice then it says up Rihanna Rihanna pranam means passing away date or before all la till you get the liberation spiritual austerity should be practiced and how one should practice it and one after another sloka it says are seen some God you should practice it by city so that concentration and when I am running I am taking the name of God when I am working i am taking the name of God and when I am driving i am taking the name of God is ok but at the same time seriously a fixed seat fixed place fixed time if I come and see my body and mind automatically become adjusted that this time I should practice spirituality are Cena some God by pop early seating one should practice it just by lying down or just painting not like that pop early sitting one should properly sit and then slowly he go on goes on in that way Janet cha dianna cha cha cha means and Dianna cha when you are practicing concentration that is also parson on the personal must be continuous who personal should have the faith who portion is best to we can do by sitting and at the time of concentration then it says h'lim job picture without any movement or gelatin a chela a Cholla means without movement to sometimes when you are sitting that's why bhagavan sri ramakrishna he is giving that example from his own life when he used to go to Kali temple for meditation just before entering he used to turn back and see the image stone image of a yogi sitting over there still that image is there and he is to see see that is to go and see it is to think that he is also becoming a stone image whole body is just becoming like that and everywhere in the whole body no movement no feeling so a shallot wat cha picture without any movement one should practice by sitting at a time of concentration and also a chill at war or challacombe cha picture then it gives in the fourth smaran teacher and remembering every moment that is also Ubar shonna what is a personal when you are remembering God every moment in the the bengali song on great Sedaka he is telling when you are moving around in the city think that you are going on circling the temple and the mother and remembering her when you were eating think that you are feeding the Divine Mother when you are sleeping thing that you are lying on the lap of your Divine Mother every time every moment go on repeating repeating repeating remembering and in another song it says when that condition comes there is no not a single moment left when I cannot think of God then why should I go to the pilgrimage centres holy places miss not misery gaya Ganga pragaash rd kashi konchi kovitch I all this very very famous holy places pilgrim centres the gaya Ganga preveza kashi means banaras kanchipuram the famous place who wants that Kali Kali Kali Bolle ojamajo jeepers I if I go on repeating the name of Goddess Kali he was the devotee of Kali so he is telling when I am taking the name of Goddess Kali continuously why should I bother about visiting the holy places so that is the spiritual condition so here it says smaran teacher and when you are remembering every moment of God that is also sadhana then again it says yeah three KAG duta tatra be she shot whenever mind gates tranquil then practice sometimes some people will say when I will do the practice yeah morning and evening as the Guru has said is ok when you're free you do and suppose some time sometimes I have seen the some people they come the seat over in the chair and just closing the eyes but be-before a long time they are sitting why suddenly that thing has come the time time has come when is his mind is becoming tranquil yatra acog gotta the moment you find that your mind is becoming concentrated it's not thinking other thing and not liking to talk to somebody or read anything immediately see it and try to meditate that is a good time because that mind is becoming tranquil ji tusi a kibriya some bother k the issue are seated we never mind becomes concentrate practice now we're even the first is the wayne evil and this is where ever do pacita disha means the place sometimes someplace we go the vast sea and open field wonderful blue sky no people around so we feel like sitting over there sit there try to practice meditation over there is called the parson ah when you are sitting over there immediately the mind will be tranquil so take that opportunity the situation in whatever place sometimes some of the particular places when you go our mind becomes tanker if you go to docs in Asia or two that that particular room where Saddam o Krishna leave for such a long time if you go and see if you feel that your mind is going back to those days because you have read the gospel he can remember how the master Masha is entering Narendra entering all people are coming and sitting see Ramakrishna sitting in this small caught and then he is talking he is making cutting jokes and making fun and dancing singing so many things happen you go to sport your mind into that and that is a wonderful and you feel like going over there again and again that is the place where ever your mind is dragging you to go go and try to utilize that particular atmosphere and that is called OOP asana what will happen after all the super sauna obvious ah drama theatre do cantante nagar chatty in the bhagavad-gita 18 chapter it says all your long practice of discipline or dope a sauna puts an into all sorrows puts an end to all sorrows what is the penis everyone is trying to get the happiness the joy the P is the bleeze what is that the end of Sorrows then automatically happiness and how to complete the end of Sorrows will come by practicing OOP asana so this here we find today that c ramakrishna is urging to practice soup asana this is a daily routine regularly have to do this a discipline now how we can do it how long we should do till we get the liberation how we should do better if we are sitting better when we are trying to concentrate better when you are practicing that in stopping all movement of your body and mind Oh challacombe and at the same time constant remembering and we never mind is becoming concentrated that time evening is approaching day is going out that Cal Sandhya Sandhya means the juncture of the day and evening and the night and day that time way if the mind is tankel practice that time and where your mind becomes tranquil go and utilize the opportunity of that particular place practice it and what he will achieve after practicing all these you will be free from sorrow so now see Ramakrishna is going to another chapter and he is telling that but this is natural that it becomes very difficult for want to understand even a person like Shankar Acharya he was a Brahma gani to be sure but at the beginning he too had the feeling of differentiation now we hear about doc Dre the Vedanta we talk about the Detapa dhaanto we always reading about the oneness the Brahman but it is so difficult to really practice it why because it is difficult even Shankar Acharya also was filling finding it really very difficult at the beginning he too had the feeling of differentiation he didn't have absolute faith that everything is the in this world is Brahman the person like Shankar Acharya then he is narrating a story incident that happened in the life of Shankara one day as he was coming out of the Ganges after his bath he saw an untouchable a butcher carrying a load of meat in advertently the butchart touched the book his body Shankar Acharya spa d Shankara shouted angrily hey there how did you touch me then that person told revered said the butcher said I have not touched you nor have you touched me the pure self cannot be the body and not the five elements now the 24 cosmic principles cheb doctor 24 principals it is not then she and Cara came to his senses he understood he is not an ordinary butcher he is the Shiva himself the in Kashi he realized this type of things and his knowledge became really perfect the here also in life of Swami Vivekananda we find he hard and then afterwards after the experiences his knowledge became perfect so naturally it is a long long long practice and a personalities the great personalities like SH Anchorage vivekananda when they were having this is natural that we too will act and moreover there are two things that we must not forget the one is Babu herika and another is param arctica another the babu herika that is worldly that is practical and another is param erotica and which his spiritual transcendental actual that is param article but we cannot practice all the time the paramore thika things because the brahman is not having the any thirst any hunger any pain any pleasure and if you expect that a person living in the body which you also have the same it is wrong because Babu harika is a different thing the moment you achieve meant to get a body body has his own way of leaving the thirst will be there pain will be there joy will be there hunger will be there and all these things will be there in the body so these two things and shankara's he said and then in one place is telling anyone in any place can have that real knowledge of brahman and he is mentioning about jarrah Virata Jorah burrata burrata was his name and jerra means he was just like a stone he never talked he never did anything so this one King was there he was not knowing who is this man sitting quietly without any talking without doing anything he needed one person to help to carry his palanquin and he asked why not you come and join and helping the king of the country is asking naturally jariv arith the Great Sage afterwards people discovered he went and he was carrying and he was going on that it was the first time he was going on talking about the knowledge and while the King that Garibaldi was carrying the King rohu ghana's palang cream and at the same time giving a discourse on self-knowledge atma border the King got down from the palanquin has said to your every thur who are you then he answered and up yerself Jaden and aruba shivoham shivoham hand up yourself he had perfect a faith that he's the pure self I hand up yourself that this is the conviction of the Johnnies and at the same time immediately he is mentioning but the baptists a whole universe is the glory of God so approaches that is the beauty of the Hinduism sanatana dharma is having so many different type of views and approaches why because there are four different type of temperament mentality the one person is very much eager to all the time keeping his mind busy on discrimination and he don't like to go to Temple for worship you don't like to do any service work he don't like to do any other thing but constantly his whole mind is focused on knowledge so gani another is working another is devotion because the natural log and emotion that he is focusing channelizing towards God and that is called devotion and that is why the major the Serrano Krishna mentioning over here that's the path of gani i am the self but the doctor says the whole universe is the glory of God whole universe is the glory of God it is not God glory of God the God has created these manifested days but does not mean that he has been exhausted by creating this it doesn't mean that he is this but it is in God resting in God but this is the what the buck the seas no matter what path you follow Yoga is impossible unless the mind becomes quiet now see Ramakrishna's doing that whatever path you want to follow you can but yoga what is the yoga union with God union with artman as you call it realization god-realization self realization that is called union to that call yoga union union of the yoga is impossible unless the mind becomes quiet the mind of the Yogi's under his control he is not under the control of his mind and what is mine we know the mind means the process of thoughts is repository of different thoughts constantly moving on one not another like the waves of the ocean non-stop it is moving we're from the thoughts are coming from the past bow and one after another so many lives we have lived and naturally so many experiences from there so many different thoughts are constantly crossing and in the modern age it is more difficult previously it was not so many things where there we didn't know so naturally mind was not attached to those themes and nowadays it is so much a test if you notice particularly in the developed country like this America not a single person in for a single moment we doubt cell phone these are that constantly the mind was over there I saw a lady she was doing some exercises on her and then also she is going on oh that time also you are going on observing something in our telephone and constantly all the people over there is among the microphones are so loudly the songs are going on still then each and every one individually plugging the year and listening something and the devices has come up so that they can when they are working the physical they can tie the keep that phone the hand over here running and all these things and constantly what is it the symbol of tremendous mental agitation big ship de Moura a different type of mental condition so these e kagra concentrated mind is the only way and there is no other way that's why the spiritual practice like taking the name of God is the only way whatever we are doing is no problem but go on repeating the name of God just like that and see Ramakrishna is telling if you are getting down in the water by yourself or somebody is pushing into you into that water both are the same result similarly if we are driving and repeating the name of God half at Italy my attention is on driving my attention is on many things but at the same time I am repeating that will also work nothing is going to be wasted so that way we can keep our mind sometimes when we are driving putting a a CD listening to the spiritual thing that will also take our mind constantly the same idea but most of the people they listen to budgam that is also good but there is a short of a entertainment if the music is rhythmic music is there we don't pay much attention to the words of the budget of the divine song we are not paying much attention to the worlds and the meaning of those words but we are enjoying the tune the music and there is an entertainment sort of entertainment but not enlightenment so the Enlightenment constantly we have to take consciously the name of God merit agree the real all do sadhana kuya cycles always a coat as a famous song of Mira we have to not that is ok the music is ok the tune is ok but what is the meaning of those words I have only one God and he is my all and nothing else so that constantly sure that it should be in the mind that's why I bhagwan is telling see Rama Krishna is telling no matter what path you follow Yoga is impossible unless the mind becomes quiet the mind should become quite how with one thought there are so many thoughts constantly crossing my mind when I want to control it i cannot control it because the mind is not under my control other i am under the control of my mind so obviously here we have to do the opposite and how we can do that by sending a strong thought oppose it thought to the that current that is coming flowing what is the opposite thought name of God if we can send the name of God in the same flow or more powerful flow then the other thoughts will slowly stop I will not do merely to read it says as salam o Krishna stealing it will not do merely to repeat I am he I am he he is again taking that the Ghana Marquis is very difficult in the bhagavad-gita also see Krishna is giving this the one must be very very careful because the guiana mark is very difficult I am NOT he I am NOT he you can it repeat but what is he that you do not know that i am he i am he the what is he that we have two rather you have two constants a I am NOT that what I am thinking this body this mind disassociation when I am thinking in that way that is the mistake and making he means the god he means the brahmana means the all-pervading consciousness so that if we can there are certain signs of agony sri ramakrishna stealing all mean are by no means on the same level all men are by no means on the same level it is said that there are four classes of men men means the people the bound the struggling deliberated and the everfree there is a wonderful way the ceramic is analyzed the psychology of the human being bog da bound and struggling and he is also there liberated ever free struggling means trying to be free momax you but the moo shu mokta Nita mata Mata means liberated knit them up to ever free like the sugar they are ever free then why they are taking birth only to help the human soul and to give them the guidance how one should practice spirituality Thank You
