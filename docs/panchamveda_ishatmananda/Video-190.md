[191: Panchama Veda 191: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna: Live Unattached in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VP7RWv2Lfc)

furgus start with this mantra Takata madam the jeevan KO be rewritten calendar Shabana Mangalam three Madonna booby green and de Bali dodging ha now Salam - done he is having a wonderful dialogue conversation today we will go through that the set up business the conversations which mainly with the master Marcia the recorder of the convert this title so he is asking the ceramic each name is asking particularly that line I had to read where he said those who have a human body for the first time need the experience of saints enjoyments I am reading from the page five zero four five hundred for those who have a human body for the first time need the experience of sins enjoyments in our last disc discussions I was reading from the page five zero three one gentleman asked me I couldn't remember perhaps he is listening and now 5:03 we discussed the seven steps of the devotion and here first the company of the holy person then the sitar the faith then comes the nishta bhakti bhava mahabhava the implement ultimately bus to LA realization so that is and today's Ramakrishna is beginning the conversation after some other words he said first time proton Manisha Genma the first time taking the human birth that means in different life in different form a different shape we had experiences and this is the when someone is having the first human birth a tremendous desire to enjoy this sense of chips and that is what you will notice in other places so many thousands of people go but when there's a philosophical discussions are going on pure religious discussions and the activities very few people certainly wonder and sometimes people they come to me from different other organizations and they request me to give them some idea how to attract the younger generation these and there I taught you compare and see how things are happening because this is the main reason that's why I am reading it is the ceramic isness is the first time the people are coming in this way so this will be naturally the ceramic Tichenor those who have a human body for this time made the experience of sense enjoyments spiritual consciousness is not awakened unless certain duties have been performed spiritual consciousness - just to develop to have spiritual consciousness love for the higher spiritual life you have to perform some actions corrupt those actions he has not listed over here you didn't talk about that but again in different places we know the spiritual life how it goes how it develops what are the things we should have in the spiritual life so first and foremost those seven steps again and again he is telling that you have to go to a holy person and then you must listen to him try to understand that removing your ego then only it is possible again and again the cinema Krishnaveni but the people have asked how to realize God first word even use shadow Sangha and in the scriptures also every very fine satsang satsang salsa what is it such the positive ideas ideas about the spirituality what is this positive ID and ideas of the spirituality again well there is no connection of this name fame and worldly pleasure when we are constantly thinking about the higher moral values that is spirituality the spirit and that is very very rare why because of our past karma that drags us down in some other time to define say Ramakrishna is giving the sample the some of the animals the children in the in the villages they will die a heavy stone and that animal trying to go inside the hole but again because of the width coming back coming down mind is just like that name fame all this comes from the ego and ego is nothing but that I consciousness is nothing but reflection of the pure consciousness on our booty all these details are there even then that I never goes always within hi-hi and that is all complication so ceramic isne he is mentioning in these then spiritual consciousness is not awakened so we must try to imbibe the very first thing what is that God is there or the consciousness is there you know in Hinduism always they try to approach through two main two different paths one the devotional path another path of knowledge those who can understand that practice the path of knowledge where they will see I am that consciousness and okay 14 the path of consciousness and he will say oh in my intellect the reflection of the consciousness so I don't belong to this body this body is not my mind my mind all these thoughts and cognitions are not so we are that pure soul those who can thinking that constantly is okay and those who cannot they take another route and that is devotion and what is the division God is there it becomes easy for us because somebody is there so ceramic and he is asking his disciple and here this is very interesting Salem Tichenor never could think that I the ego it couldn't recognize that it is I he say eat this body is it as if something else it is not he that's Ramakrishna and very curiously asking question about himself to his disciple and with the dessert of Master Marshall who is recording the conversation he is asking these questions to master merger well what do you think of my state of mind the what is my condition is asking to his disciple master merger why he is asking he want to understand or to know the capacity of master Marche the how much he has understood him when we go to some person either most of us majority of us out of emotion we think all that out of image emotion or sometimes when other people are talking about him we also carry carried by that thought our pure original analysis thinking about the person is very less when somebody would say you know that show me his father was a very very rich person they were having this business dad and he has slept that and he has come immediately we start thinking is a great soul because we associated with the wealth and the name and fame of the particular family from where the particular Swami's coming we do judge about his behavior and his thought processes know so that is we are carried out because of different things is very difficult to judge a person and Saddam official neighbor asked this question to anyone else except this master Marcia and there is another reason also master Masha is going to represent ceramic Tichenor two words because Saddam Oh Krishna is present now with us through his words and that should be presented exactly as it is and understanding what he meant for these meant by this and that is the reason cinema Krishna is asking even replying is real is it wonderful easily on the surface you are very simple but inwardly very deal it is extremely difficult to understand that is true it's called sahaja this is the people who are apparently Jesus Christ very simple apparently Shri Krishna when he is going and mixing with those people in the Brindavan so simple he is dancing singing playing with the in talking with him so many things are there and it's it's nothing is so simple Shami be vacant under when he is mixing with these frames and known people so simple marsha of the money they be the most of the time people used to think that if she doesn't understand anything we have to go and help so we have to help that way this to think why he fine in the bhagavata itself he says the Supreme God is having two aspects one for PA re for us and another is an opera ABA re the para and uber these are the two aspects of the God and what is part of pure consciousness without any emitters which is very difficult to understand only that ghani's reaching up to the ultimate then only they can understand and what is opera whole creation this whole creation is his in the Bhagavata when you read the module and Futaba the conversation they refined para operatio mod I'm sure you - he a GOP job to the Gabon lithography I am quoting only one line not the whole circle it's Apsara opera both are pokemons the gods what is this opera mod I'm sure you've dimensions in an eternal and that is called property and from there all the creations comes down so these are the two aspects the one is completely different completely detached pure consciousness and another is associated with dr. Raja Tama these three qualities and then the permutation and combination of those three qualities all different type of creations comes down and timidly whatever we see is nothing but that so brother what disease it is like this and it gives an example your dog named the fire in the wood there is fire but apparently it is ood only we don't understand but fire he's there otherwise you won't be able to burn it so that are already there like that it keeps the last word yet happening that means we the human being is also having that same capacity as the God is having we had to understand that so this first is the para and another is of opera and we see only over a condition of the God how we will know what is that para so master Masha is giving the dancer though on the surface you are very simple but because a bird he is talking his inquiry just like all ordinary human being but inwardly very deep and then my ceramic is nice mild and as a true we said true that means the master martial whatever the assessment about this Ramakrishna Ramakrishna is admitting it true then he is going out there he made not a mirage Lattimore is a one of the direct disciples of cinema Krishna afterwards he got the wonderful sannyasa name at the booth ananda is a wonder they are both so that a master salaam dish to notice team that boy used to live with Ram Krishna in the Dakshina sure he is asking the why do you look so sickly he is staying with ceramic dish now now this is the responsibility of the who to look after the disciples also whether they are on the right path or not so why do look so sickly then history I can hardly eat anything is that the only reason are you meditating too much so he is asking this question when too much of meditation he forgets about maintaining the body and doing other things slowly this thing happened cinema business he never encouraged though certainly some people will start doing practicing too much of meditation too much austerity and that kind enough you have to go normally slowly and then step a stable should develop that's what he is asking then slowly the cinema Krishna is asking to him I have a request to make you please tell Bob to stay with me a day or two during rakhal's absence knuckle means the end of the disciple of sri ramakrishna who became the first president of the first president of Kishan me G cha maybe we can under them afterwards and this Raja models known as the Raja Maharaja and this Raja Murad this is picture is here about him because Raja Mirage also started practicing a long time meditation so he is asking another disciple to come and stay with him slowly slowly helping them to develop in spirituality he said I shall tell him the Ramakrishna asked him whether he thought that Buddha was kindness why he's asking this the master Mercia you as a teacher so naturally he had the idea to understand the mentality of the younger generation Saddam kishna wants to have his opinion so he is asking the guide unless presented the master left them going to the direction of the Pine Grove and after a few minutes aim and the law to standing at the Panchavati here the master mache is describing how he saw Saddam kishna as the God himself that is the realization that is the feeling la - and master machine waiting and at the fact when the Saddam occasion was coming back they found ceramic isne with at the back there's a black cloud and that is reflecting on the water of the Ganges and the wonderful that circumstances and there they saw the white cloth see Ramakrishna approaching did you see him as Salam o Krishna this other God is approaching to them but it is his personal realization sedimentation returned to his pool aside on the small couch the hearts room are shaking etre used to stay very close to selfishness almost the outside of his room and those who have read about ceramic kitchen you know this character Hara he also used to practice spirituality read lot of spiritual books particularly scriptures but it had tremendous ego just like any other than the ordinary people who always think that I have read the scripture and I know much better than anybody yells exit exit this has arrived she was there and he came and he was telling look at this navi Chaitanya but from cornica canal is the area from the other Naga Chaitanya though householder she has put on a red cloth request means the gala the householders are not supposed to because we have to leap to hurt the number with the tradition recently I went to earth we go very frequently almost in every two three months to have that the religious discourses and there they were asking me there are purse called that rabbi and he was asking it one of the decided devotees she was asking me why this color you are wearing what is the significance of this color this is the color of renunciation it is renunciation how to describe I have taken the life of renunciation in India no one will bear accept as much bong-sun sannyasins if you are a householder if you are doing something of the worldly things you are not supposed to wear it of course it is available in the market you can purchase it but you are not supposed to that is the tradition the moment you were putting it on you are not supposed to stay inside the house maintaining a family having the business earning money you are not supposed to some people who know sometimes they do they have the respect but still and they have the likings do but they are not supposed to so here they find that Hara is pointing to no no Chaitanya no I checked anemia and he is telling that his house early cinema Krishna's comment at this moment he said what shall I say I clearly see that it is God Himself who has assumed all these human forms doing the highest the spiritual condition when you look at this it is everything is nothing but God he says I see God Himself who has assumed all these human forms therefore I cannot take anybody take anybody to task not angry is again involved in lawsuit as right supporting and conversing that the conversation is going on the first that Saddam occasion said I cannot say anything why because he cannot see anyone except God as a condition of that keep finding the Rama the Hanuman ji he could not see anything but Rama every time all the time the same thing ultimate realization of the Gianni's what the see Chaitanya consciousness everywhere and of the devotees God everywhere so this is the ultimate realization at that time they cannot find any difference any difficulties everything is good God is doing it y para that condition of God is pure consciousness is completely inactive but opera that is the God is becoming battle people and God is becoming good people and the bad people in the God in the form of birth is now giving travel to the God in the form of good people these things goes on for us we think is a bad person why God is helping not helping not anything it goes and the God goes in this way and this is called Leela the creation it is so difficult to understand the moment we can understand it what happens we become completely free from anxiety and that is called Jeevan Muktha condition the in this life itself we are completely free we will come to that country that particular chapter where ceramic richness discussing about that how to live completely unattached in this line cinema Krishna said like that but again he comes down and giving the example of Norah in Granada hofstra he see again he is having the litigation after the passing away of the nari enemies afterwards a mediator and then when its father passed away all his relatives as usual they tried to grab the property and Narendra being the eldest son he was going to save that property to give it to his mother and brothers sisters so that they can survive so he was going to coat and all that so when that was reported not injuries again involved in a lawsuit now listen to the comment of ceramic dish now he doesn't believe in shakti the divine mother if one assumes a human body one must recognize heart this is the great statement we sometimes ignore the Shakti the power of God the one lady she was reporting to informing Saddam vishna the master I am going to an appeal image immediately sound is not extra did you inform to marsala Domini Devi she don't know oh no you must go to hard tell her that you were going to those places holy places take our blessings then your journey to the holy places will be beneficial do we go tourist if we go and take this the camera and then snaps and all disappeared but if you are going for the development of the spirituality to be a holy place you must take the permission and the blessings of the shakti so it surely means not disassociated from the God they are the God's power but in a different form that is the Hindu way of understanding the God with pure consciousness and God with activity and that is Shakti now not in having the human body is denying it why not understanding this thing and fix problem the river was in and haja not in the sales if I believe in Shakti all would follow me the when he was very young even that time he was a leader so he was having some friends and followers if I believe others why he mentioned like that nor endure because in the whole society at that time if you read the history of that India at that time a movement was going on to constantly telling that all the gods and goddesses of the Hindus are useless worthless there are all the imagination nothing is going to happen because the British was ruling so obviously some other people in the girl of the religious people they used to not that almost in the street corners dis to stand and this to have used the Hindu gods and goddesses and it was a terrible condition people who are afraid because if you go and tell them anything immediately the police will come the government will come on you and you will be harassed like them so people is to only avoid them but the young modern girl is to go and fight with them whenever there will be someone criticizing the Hindu gods and goddesses the young Narendra used to go and who over there itself he'll be having the conversation and denouncing him to that your fault you don't know etc he was very courageous but he was not going to call you why because he was thinking and that was the idea and you know it is very difficult to go beyond that when the thought is going on almost all people we have carried out with that thought and that was how can you worship a lady who is killing others and having the heels at the girl and goddess Kali the most of the people even today in India some of the people do you name accept goddess Kali and it all is a depicted that it is terrible it is terrible this terrible in the him Indian movies if you see something wrong some fighting the record is Cal in a very bad form they will tip it and not understanding goddess Kali is the goddess of knowledge but that you that will discuss some other time I have talked many times this is the mistake that the Narendra ideal and see Ramakrishna's world not in the but it is not good for him to go to the extreme of denying this divine so we have to take the blessings of the Divine Mother constantly praying to her he is now under Shakti's inst jurisdiction Shorty's jurisdiction as long as we are having I consciousness I associated with this body and mind we are under that jurisdiction of the Shakti there's some time to say Maya in the parenting they will say Maya Salam o Krishna see under the jurisdiction of Goddess Kali Shakti the power the shakhter they always follow that shorty and it's true we cannot simply deny it sometimes some people they talk about Ramana Maharshi or among or she denied it he never followed but to look at the condition the road was she from the beginning of his life when he was a young boy his condition was very high in the spiritual life the pc has already completed that all those things he has completed him in this life he has started from there and without doing anything if I try to be like him what will be my condition I won't be able to do so if everywhere a single accomplished single neuron gesture say I don't know the name of this country sir singers in Indian autumn and Jessica is very very famous even today wonderful songs okay Lata Mangeshkar in one day Rome was not built in a day we always say in English that means you have to prepare yourself and for the preparation very first thing is understanding there is Maya there he is power and that is why under the power of the Maya I am deluded I am thinking this body as high there is the first wrong thing that I am doing I have to overcome that but this is the condition present and what to do begin with one thing first faith and second prayer first faith God is there and then prayer Oh God Oh mother Oh father in whatever we like to call God please help me please help me please help me otherwise it is very difficult all the actions that we did in the past the result will come now and I have to suffer for me enjoy little bit so this goes on and this is the only way to go out of their prey into the mother praying to the Shakti please hold my hand keep me on your lap and guide me how could I go out today develop the spiritual life that should be the prayer and hadn't seen Narinder lately he is asking to the MasterChef no dating last few days I to see see him and bring him here in a carriage he is asking master Manasa as the ordinary teacher why because he knew who not even druggies so he's asking master Marche don't think that he is under the influence of the Maya that I will take care bring him here and master what about the paavana would he come here so frequently if he didn't have any good tendencies one after another he is just mentioning but immediately we have to understand why he is mentioning this and another young boy he is a friend of Narendra nod his name was power not huge to receive ceramic ashtray very frequently the ceramic business telling master Marcia would he come here so frequently if he didn't have good tendencies this is the point - not good diligences if we don't have the good tendencies we won't be able to read holy books for long time try to read the holy book for an hour you do oh my god my eyes are paining it is not possible to read I am not understanding what they say like this like this will go on but if you read some other books some of storybooks immediately we can complete eyes beside the flight we Niko so many people are doing mostly nowadays in computer these there sometimes some people are reading books some storybooks and then a two-hour slide and complete the whole book and leave the book over there itself but ask them to read some holy good book they won't be white tendencies and what are those tendencies past impressions you will never feel joy to some of our Swami's this start with a jealousy when they are very young can you imagine the highest philosophy their liking the highest philosophy there that philosophy when they're very young one Xiaomi I was talking with him from a Jew he was instructing me you should do these who do that everybody see me as farming and I can show you whether you were having the frame no I like to meditate a lot and so I used to practice meditation after coming back from the school my only game was to meditate or to do puja or to sing a jam do you think it is just in this life a me first start we team in that level is it possible the past lives so tendencies what are the tendencies impressions from the past life that we are carrying so now we have to understand I have to judge myself other people they may see something or we can predict in some other way before others most of the people they do like that so the hypocrisy is much more in religious life whatever they say and they behave that unity is not maybe not in their mind why tendencies that impressions and it says in this way that I will not come I do you know good tendencies what about variations are - they always meditate why is that Harish and Lottie results of a young boy and lot - we know a lot to Mirage and he was a servant uneducated boy he used to serve in somebody's house for money but afterwards he became a great secret saint and they've meditate do you think meditation is so easy we go and pay ten dollars and then meditate and in the course of meditation and this meditation that meditation and then we constantly telling the have an attention on the ear that you are emailing and you are exhaling and that wit is that so many ways but meditation means completely different thing controlling of your past impressions that is floating in your mind the moment you close your eyes and try to meter your mind from the error surrounding what happened immediately the storehouse open up and all the start coming so that is so difficult and loud to his meditating so much that is guru sri ramakrishna asking him not to do that so much so this is the tendencies and master possibly you are right perhaps others may take their place now and this master means surround is know why he mentioned like that he was asking these boys after they came to serve me but now they are slowly developed in the spiritual life so much they don't have the mind to anything so you better bring some of the young boys known to Salaam of Krishna so that they will take their place if you'll notice if we have truly the coursework not my ego and my word you will find a person is doing away another person is coming to you and the person who came to help you after doing some work very unfortunately develop ego and they go away so this really goes on in our lives also we have seen so many people friends you won't believe in Andaman where there was no one year one after another they came and they helped me to develop a huge institution whenever I wanted an engineer to guide me to construct a building on engineer came when I wanted a person to help me to appeal to the government and other organizations for the father same type of people came one after another and to maintain that so our to develop these to develop there one often other they came they did and they left with their time King and the person came and this is true I have seen it in my own eyes it has happened in my life so if you have got any opportunity to serve see Ramakrishna the purest of the pure don't leave that opportunity don't even allow your mind to be crowded or clouded with ego oh if I don't go out I don't like to go over there I'll stop like there's no naughty even so this is Amma Krishna he is telling that this forest they came they are no they are not leaving but they have elevated in the spiritual life so other people will come has Rana left ceramic is now and the master Masha does what they see in the state of ecstasy attract people he is asking the master machine oh yes very much what do people think of me do they think anything in particular about me when they see me in that condition we really knew a wonderful synopsis of knowledge so synthesis of knowledge and and renunciation synthesis of knowledge and love here we find in that the animator of Marche our Ataman EDB seclorum masterís Tanja sakru lannister Estanza you both the hands are now resting on your own land and put the helmets Gianna bhaktapur die named Gianna and birthday the port we get from the Lancer Don Kirshner this is the uniqueness as because I'm a monk of the Ramakrishna order I'm telling you know if you read his life and his teachings you will feel that so many people are now coming and joining disorder we don't have any machineries to propagate to some of the organizations they can propagate so wonderfully thousands of people they know their names but be done to societies here is America the oldest Hindu religious organization in America from 1893 but how many are the people they know us very few and if you go to other places they are crowded but he had very few why the pure spirituality is very difficult to get attraction because you meet good tendencies and very handful of people those who come over here stick to this if you look at their life you will see how wonderfully they're developing spiritually so this what's Adama Krishna is mentioning and he is asking do they understand this then miss Rama Krishna is asking then he said sick in pandava known as Kosh para eccentric cetera they always say that have I any ego he was describing about the posh Prada I just I'm not really that because time is very short I'm going to the main questions serrano history is asking his disciple master Marcia have I any ego and look at why he asked master machine if you've read there instead of the market immersion you can understand how clear his idea words he said he said and little you have kept heed to preserve your body and to enjoy divine love in the company of the devotees and impart spiritual knowledge to them so this is the clear idea unless and until we understand the sama pitch named this way we won't be able to develop our spiritual progress and that's called the pure knowledge again masters Ramakrishna is asking as a saris long history still no I have not kept it it is God himself but this is the answer no I have not gifted when they are samara the money they be when with ramakrishna passed away they whatever Ramakrishna is actually mission what you do mother turn he was having no mission at all he was just doing what the divine mother wanted him to do but the main thing that I noticed mother is telling there is all religious bad combination of all religions Exeter Exeter she said it may be that on the process of his sadhana it has done but what I really noticed in his life mother Maura nominative is telling renunciation they are they are they are not an iota of ego that is ceramic busines can we imagine that I am without any ego but some people even in Chicago run so-called prophecy she has written a book on sambucus do you know that criticizing see Ramakrishna some people are also what these people how did you understand ceramic is not the purest of the pure was not having any ego and these people they are the bundles of heroes and they are judging this in the human form the purest form of the God it is God who is doing all these I don't know anything see Ramakrishna stealing and March tomorrow certainly asking another question you see true that Kali has become Krishna if you go to Turkish nation you will find it's a beautiful you know the in India those who are following the Krishna they will never look at Kali and those who are following Kali never think of Krishna but the place where Saddam additional practices spirituality in darshan Asia both the temples are side by side and cinema Krishna started his worship thrust in the see the Krishna and then you until Connie and master Marshall asking this question is it true some people they say Sedano Krishna who never read anything immediately mentioned it is in the devi bhagwat there's a huge book they be bothered and the air they say the Kali hertzel became Krishna now let us go to this aim remain speechless when when the sadhana kishna mention God is infinite and infinite other ways to reach him whether Krishna or Kali or knowledge all paths and leading to the same goal only if you are having the ego you're stuck you won't be able to move aim remain speechless this is also we should notice because aim is just like us trying to develop spirituality but much much advanced why he immediately realized this all paths are leading to the same goal is very difficult to understand if you go to any person we invited one person to give it table over here in ramakrishna mission in Gurgaon to society we always accept that all paths lead him to the same goal as because our mentors our masters ceramic Christian Vivekananda Machado that they always talked like that so we follow here also we find the picture of Jesus on the same level of our gods Ramakrishna and the the bhagavad-gita so this master Marshall he understood it immediately other people can't understand that this is why you have kept these pictures narrow scenes of understanding they think this is this you know the moment you are thinking very narrow way the New Zealand things happen because there's constantly thinking just by killing some innocent people do you think that you'll be able to eradicate that philosophy it's not possible so how to understanding this way only that we are all leading to the same goal I am going in my own path and I say always go in your own path I have all best wishes good wishes to you and master MA she understood it Sadam Oh Krishna is technology it is through the grace of God that you have understood that without his grace doubt is never clear down we need to understand here there are two type of thing one is both the intellect another is d also intellect but to understand the subtlest thing in the spiritual life is called E and when we understand that many other things you know some of the people in the worldly life they are so intelligent they understand so many things and you know the one gentleman was there you are stealing if you give your money to me I will make that money double and more than double I know the processes and this way that we end truly he was almost impressed me but anyway I can't give the money to him so that way is really very % a team but I was not understanding anything what you say but I said it said you know that organization that organization of money I cannot use but thank you for giving me that they know so many things but tell them about the God or the spiritual life they will just ask question like the children do you believe in God said that the first question so this is the way we always think why D is not there but D is there and but they can give you many other ideas many other things but unless and until you are having the D that is also another type of intellect but it understands the solidity of the religion the subtle truth what is that all paths are leading to the same goal and then sadhana business say that the important thing is somehow to cultivate devotion to God and love for him this is one important thing to cultivate the love for God devotion for God and secondly saved but again he can leave an attached in the world the two different ways first is devotion whatever I see is God's good bad sometimes I am suffering God wished that so I am suffering no problem and I mean had to go for the respite to God only God is giving me the punishment and I have to God in and say please don't leave me in that way hold my hand whatever wrong thing I have done you are punished it's okay now you should please place your hand on my there is a devotional way and complete faith God is there and if I pray if I cry as my parents are giving me that comfort the Cortile also come and give me the comfort sure why not and the other way is again he can leave unnoticed in the world when we read the karma yoga ashram in Vivekananda the whoever comes past the always advise them to read Karma Yoga why it is not Karma Yoga is the part of guiana we thought what we cannot survive we are doing work different type of work and we must have to do some work some of the newly married the wives they count the only complaint is how we live over here we don't have any company any engagement husband is going out at the seven o'clock in the morning returning back seven applause in the evening how I Will Survive how many movies I will watch him pass my time we need to work but if we know the secret to do that work your feel and what is that secret unattached and here you find the yoga ball sister the greatest book of the knowledge it says Yasha brevity come yes my a to neighbor be na na hoga Iran are urgentiy jeevan mukta such appeal salam o krishna say tianni can leave unattached in the world Jeevan Mukta he is living at the same time completely free from attachment when I think that this is my family my husband my wife my and mine society I see my my mind go back again and ask you salut am i why do you have a touching like this we are living together surviving together okay but some deal become when we have to say goodbye to each other resolve years look back to our own life when we were growing up so many frames in the same locality how you used to go to the the ground to play and so many things we did where are those frames now and that way is slowly slowly we are green up and you are becoming alone but not lonely why I have another company that is myself my company's me I am sometimes closing my eyes and seeing myself within my heart and that is the light inside me and when I go to the holy company will you only book and learn that it is true and I see it close my eyes we draw myself from the world I may go back to myself and that is called Jeevan Mukta the fame the married and the world the Russia would not know what I'm going to do with that some people are going on collecting foreign money money money what they will do afterwards they don't know only they do not know that they won't be able to carry that ma fond along with but one gentleman who owned a lot of money and in read in the newspaper 35 percent of his own earning a huge amount he has given for the development of the poorest section of the society she would be remembered by the poorest section of the society and then next life you'll be on the path of Buddha because he has given of all those in all of our life don't think that this is the only life don't think the first time you are coming to the baton to society know if you could know that in the past life also so many good words we have done and look at your own family how many of them are coming over here and if you go and talk about this they will look at each other and say see look at this man they're becoming man even over here in a miracle if you are not going to the party not going to these and there people will look down upon you they are all backward people know you are advanced but who will understand we have to go under could Shiv abortion a compassion Siddhartha a compassion I am talking about the path of guiana
