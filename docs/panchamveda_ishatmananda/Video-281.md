[282. Panchama Veda 282 : Brother , Go Beyond Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp4Uu0g5z34)

namaskar good evening dear devotees and friends today wednesday and we will be reading the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna as you always call it the brothers before you start as usual we will start with this mantra in the last week we were reading the the gospel where bhagavan sirama krishna was mentioning a man needs the letter he has received from home it was the english at the page 694 the gospel of krishna by she and bengali published by the udbodhan as a complete volume page number 732 a man needs the laters he has received from home as long as he has not learned its content suramar krishna was mentioning it about the how many scriptures should we shall we read there's no end in reading the scripture there's so many so on that he was giving a wonderful example the man received a letter from home and there was a list of things that he has to acquire and he lost that later and he was thinking what to get it and otherwise what will happen it was an important thing so he was searching and when he got those letters and he read the contents and after that after reading it however he set out to get the things that is exactly what suramar krishna is meaning practice suramar krishna never read the upanishads or the veda or other other scriptures but wonderfully his own experience and the way of his explanation that always go and talibate the upanishads one one swami vivekananda mentioned to his brother disciples but with every word of bhagavan suramar i can quote from the upanishad as if it is so simple a man lost a letter which was containing a list of things that he is supposed to acquire from the city and take it back to his home in the village then he was searching for though that that later he got the later he read the content and that he was sufficient now he threw the later because now he set out to collect those things collected those things and then that was sufficient so this is the waste ramakrishna and you know in birdha and nagupanishad it also says the same thing here it says the intelligent seeker of brahman after knowing about the self alone should strive for realization he should not reflect on many words for it is exhausting to the vocal organs and just making a fun exhausting to the vocal organs that mean he should not go on reading chanting talking about all this the one word of one ounce of the work is more valuable than the pounds of thoughts and words so that is the way as swami vivekananda said that we have to understand that our life is very short we do not know what is going to happen when now we should have to go to the guru and then from the guru we must take the initiation and the mantra and the whatever the instruction the guru has said and we continue with that and that is a unique way you need not to bother about other things you are believing in the words of the guru and when you are choosing the guru selecting the guru you have to understand whether the person is having the knowledge of the brahman or god and whether he has well-versed and whether he has practiced that in his life and whether he is truthful whether because the religion and the spiritual guru his quality only quality is his spirituality whether he is a from this university and that university is not necessary his realization how he will understand that he must be having a great love for each and every one no narrowness and completely selfless there is no selfish attitude these are the two things now we get the instruction from that guru and plunge into that so that is the way here also suramar krishna also mentioning this now today only one gentleman was asking in a that what to do i am totally confused shall i go out and roam here and there go to the holy places the what to do how to realize god here in this video very clearly it is mentioning that one should do or practice what of course you have to remember this is talking about the path of knowledge so therefore their teachings are little different first renunciation tyaga without the renunciation one cannot realize anything and what we have to renounce the moment we think about renunciation with o then it is not possible for me because i have to give up the home i have to give up the family i have to give up everything no that is not possible for me forget about it next life we'll see no not like that renunciation is nothing but giving up the ego not me but thou o god that's all the renunciation means listening the ego giving up the ego that i i i me and mine that conception if that goes that is the first step as in the breeder negopanisha that is mentioning it is the first step second calmness first if i give up the ego if someone is objecting my views or ideas immediately i am angry why because it is my ego is acting that that man should receive my ideas accept my ideas who is he to contradict me it is not the ideology it is the ego that is acting the because of that ego i am behaving like that when there is no ego there is no desire the ego if i can give up fully if i can give up immediately this god realization because it is the ego only the i sense that is differentiating me from god the moment that ego goes i am nothing but that supreme lord so that listening ego and how it will be possible calmness second the calmness what is this calmness because there is no desire when i have a desire to do something so obviously if i am not fulfilling that or not getting that there will be problem in my mind oh what how i am going to do it etc so this is the prop calmness comes when there is no desire this responsibility has been given to me well i will try to do it as best as possible but suppose it is not what to do i tried my best i know i have tried my best and i will tell god i tried my best that's all that is called calmness self-control that means the all other the emotions that are there are the passions that are there so that can be controlled so when there is no ego when there is no desire automatically the self-control but these are the practices not in the one time every day i have to practice this the self-control the one one of our brother monk uh he also joined the order and he was a mathematician and he was a professor in a famous university when he became a brahmacari then the injured swamiji asked him to clean and sweep the floor of a long barranda where the monks used to stay the hmong's quarter small small rooms are there the monks is to come out in that open place just to go the staircase etc etc so his duty was to clean every day the morning time and afternoon time that because so many monks are going so you should clean it he told me you know in the beginning i was thinking what is it i'm a professor you should give give me the duty in the college he's asking this menial work anyone can do they don't need the education for that they don't know who am i the first two nights i couldn't sleep i used to feel insulted when the other swamis are coming out of the room and going looking at me that i am sweeping the floor i used to feel what is it they must be laughing then one day i remembered so i was almost thinking to leave the order and go back thinking that they don't understand the the person an educated person should not be given this type of job this type of duty i have come for god realization i will serve in the colleges so he was thinking like that and he was almost they're convinced that he has to leave the order suddenly one night when he was sleeping he remembered because he used to visit to an elderly person elderly monk and he remembered the story that that old swami told him and this is actually this way the accompany of the holy people that helps they'll be telling some stories they'll be telling some anecdotes they'll be telling something and that goes down into our mind in the subconscious it will be there but at the time of the this type of challenges the problems that helps and he was helped by that story that the elderly xiaomi told him somewhere in india that there was a shiva temple and there was a monk a very special he will never look to the people he was a very having a small little heart he made himself with the with some the leaps and all that he used to stay into that but early morning he will get up and he will go on sweeping the road that is leading to the temple thinking all the people they are coming to the sheba majority of the people they walk barefoot the days should not be hard they are coming to my god the devotees of my god my lord he loves them so obviously i should clean this path nobody asked him he took up that responsibility on himself and he used to do that when he remembered this story immediately oh my god that monk no one asked him to do but with great love used to do that work of devotion and here only my senior monks are there they're holy people and that too is a very clean place not an open public road or jungle road so there's no problem for me immediately his mind calmed down so desire the desire with the ego when that is gone minds become calm and you can control yourself we dwell up the senses regularly we had to practice meditation and meditation is nothing but withdrawing the senses from the sense organs from the sense objects that i the nose the ear elect that vibe since organs are there that they go out constantly to enjoy the saints objects rupa so we have to withdraw that no i am not going to eat anything of this i am not going to eat anything and by that way only one should have the sattva what is the i should have the holy company listen only about the holy words or the beautiful wonderful inspiring songs as we read the gospels we always find sirama krishna is asking the singers like naren and others to sing because those words the songs are nothing but the prayer so that inspired the mind and mind goes into the higher realm and that spirituality so that is the way somehow we have to keep the mind always on the spirituality which is love which is unselfishness which is calm which is blissful so that is the way we have to understand and he is telling that you should do and again the rishi suggested another next verse it was verse 20 it was 21 and this is 22 it says like this the seekers of brahman not the god it talks about the brahman the atman because it's a path of knowledge regularly read veda the scripture should be read regularly what are the scriptures the bunishads bhagavad-gita brahma-sutra the traditional but if you read the gospel of sirama krishna this is also the wonderful scripture because it is the gist of all the scriptures see they hear sadam krishna mentioned one person he was eager to find the letter where all those items were mentioned he tried to find that and when he found that read the content and then started collecting those that's all and that goes to prince the reference is there that you need not to go for all the scriptures go and get the instruction and plunge into he so that is the way we must so regularly one must read the veda and for the modern times this way that the gospel of siddha krishna the panchama that i always call it is containing all that knowledge few pages all of our senior swamis before going to bed either they themselves will read or they will ask the junior to read for them a 2-3 pages they will listen to that and they will go to sleep so this is called veda they will get up in the morning and also they will ask to read some holy scripture like this so regularly read the scripture and sacrifices what are the sacrifices the yagyas the what are the youngest panchama they mentioned for the householders first you must remember the god the moment you get up from sleep bhagavan sirama krishna he is to say that whenever you get up from the sleep the first thing you should see a picture of god or goddess so keep the picture of gods and goddesses in your room in your bedroom so that the moment you get up you see that the moment you see that holy face of god and immediately that very moment your mind become pure unknowingly this is helping you just looking at the picture of bhagavan si rama krishna mahasara swami vivekananda the moment because they are holy because their thoughts are holy you are taking the name of that god so that is second it is that you should read some scripture maybe from the gospel or holy mother's book or swamiji's book then do the charity then you can remember here they are not mentioning but remember your ancestors pitri yankya at the time of bathing you offer little water in your palm you take the water and pour it and saying i i am thankful to you all my ancestors then you are thinking about the human being if you cannot help the people right away because where you will go to find the people who need some help rather just keep one dollar a little from pennies away and collect that fund and give it to a the church or some holy place for the good work that they are doing that is the way also you are helping you're participating and it's called yagya first getting up and remembering the god second you're reading there's a devaya then rishi yagya remembering your ancestors and thinking to help the poor people illiterate people suffering people you are just keeping away little money every day from your own stock and that is also nriyakya and bhuta yankya what are the buddha yangyans just give little water or some of the grains so the birds will come and take and maybe the ants will take and like that buddha so these five and austerity what is the austerity if you are not getting something don't feel sorry for that that is called austerity so how it is possible suppose somebody you want that they should pay attention to you because you have done so many things for them maybe they are very close to you but they are not paying attention okay no problem so you also well that's okay i have done my duty so that is called austerity austerity means fasting austerity means walking bear food in the summer time austerity means taking physical all trouble that is austerity of course but at the same time when you were expecting you were expecting that these things should happen that should happen this is that because you are you are thinking that i am doing this obviously when they grow up or when they will understand they will also do the same thing to me not they are not doing it okay no problem for me that is also austerity how it is possible keep the mind to the higher thoughts so when we think that what are the spiritual practices that we should do the bridar and nagupanishad they are mentioning the two two at the sorry is a 4 4 21 and 22 these are the two three verses are there and they are giving them mentioning to who are the munis this is very interestingly they're mentioning over there they are munis because they are constantly thinking about the god and constantly taking the mind over there so manana sheila as a muni so friends now sudama krishna mentioned a simple that a person forgot the later and now when he got it he plunged for action and what is indicating what is his instruction when you have got the instruction from your guru a little faith that is there within your heart the god may be there you are not sure so we can say maybe there i don't feel but when the guru said in the scripture it is mentioned there must be something on that feeble faith just try and practice these the instructions that they have given that's all that will be sufficient and when you are practicing practicing practicing slowly slowly as bhagava krishna said our mind will become our guru the mind will dictate mind will guide and we will understand and he will feel a joy inside always every time so that is the symbol you will never feel jealousy you'll never feel hankering for anything whatever comes you are satisfied that shows the development of spirituality now suramar krishna he was talking and he was also joking that you know it is the birthday that the devotees were celebrating the surama krishna was very happy so now he asked the narendra to sing and narendra started the tuning at that his instrument so this rama krishna was making fun of that so like this it was going on then when the norin sang and particularly in dense darkness o mother thy formless beauty sparkles so this is the beauty he is singing a kali kritan a song dedicated for kali remembering kali describing kali and how is that kali though it is mentioning in danes darkness that means the all ignorance we do not know o mother then addressing that the all-pervading consciousness as the mother i can't find you i don't know you but i feel that you are there otherwise everything how it is possible going on so darkness is the indication of the ignorance and if you go beyond the darkness there is the mother and how is this mother though i am calling mother die formless beauty sparkles is the beauty the formless beauty so that is therefore the yogi is meditate in a dark mountain cave the dark mountain cave what is that in the inside the body within the mind it is the cave-like so within the mind it is still dark the full of ignorance the yogis were united with the consciousness trying to get the union that unification meditating on you oh mother who is not having any form so that means you are the consciousness the sparkles is the that means the knowledge and knowledge glitters knowledge is fire knowledge is light this is through that song this is mentioning in an ecstatic mood sirama krishna came down and sat by narendra's side he began to talk still in ecstasy the sudama question of the moment he heard that is the purity one today one person was asking me the surah krishna is bringing down the mind how is it by altering omkar because the omkara is also is a form the way his mind goes into the formless realm we cannot imagine that in that formless realm where mind remains no mind when the consciousness the little consciousness that we have the jibatma marjit with the paramatma we only read english intellectually we're trying to understand but when it truly happens what is tent experience unless one get that experience himself or herself no one can teach the surama krishna is coming down why because he is taking the help of omkara umkara is a shabda brahma it's called sabta brahma it's not brahman but somehow one can get the idea the glimpse about the brahman with the help of that shabda the sound and the form that om sirama krishna is bringing down the mind from the formless is coming to the form and then to this worldly level with the help of that so that is why he's bringing us down then someone suggested that he were that you should sing master slicing to nithya gopal shall i sing fi tunita gopal what do you say one should listen to singing to awaken the inner spirit nothing matter afterwards again what we were discussing we began the discussion with that the moment you get the hint that there is god and god is all pervading god is all consciousness in any form you can call god you can see god you can realize god in any name you can meditate and one should not waste time so through the song i have come to know this mother is a compassionate that's my mother he's full of love and full of unselfishness so that's why mother and this mother is having no form he's only the knowledge so it is sparkling it's glittering it's light and it is there in the darkness we have to go beyond the darkness and darkness symbolizes ignorance and ignorance is nothing but our ego so this way he is thinking it doesn't matter why should i have to sing then again slowly he's coming down he's mentioning about narendra he has kindled the fire that is nice now all is silent but silent means there is no war to express the silence when we are mentioning over here the silent night the holy night a silent means is a quiet night but here the silent means there is no word to express the realization so that is silence that is the mentioning here over here he has killed the fire that is nice now all is silenced there is nice that's nights too i am silent you be silent too the thing is to dive into the elixir of please you have to deep down you have to go and get that which is hidden within our heart that due to the ignorance we are not seeing it remove the ignorance with the light of knowledge then we'll find the full jar of the bliss that is what's ramakrishna that means the god realization is very practical time and that's why suramar krishna the gospel of surama krishna constantly every time again and again in different way to different people he is mentioning god is there god can be realized atman is there atman can be realized that when you talk about the duality you call god you give the name of that highest as a god and when you are trading the path of knowledge you call the brahman both are same but whatever you like no problem only don't stop only intellectually just move to and realize it the realization of upanishad always talk about the amrita this amrit means eternity not the body but the knowledge and when you go and merge into that eternity you are completely free you need not to come back again so when we have understood this birth and death this circle is terrible when we have understood that whatever that is here in this world they're offering to me as a sound as an object to see as a smell or taste or touch whatever these five things that five organs are going and enjoying that's very very temporary and that is the reason again and again and again the some people they will be trying it so many times but because of their ignorance they do not understand that they are not going to get the joy out of this some people are very fond of food some people are other types of joys some people go for drinking they think one bottle of wine they will give their joy they drink the whole bottle they know joy another bottle they again another bottle then they will just become like a wood there are no senses they will be falling on a nasty dirty place but they think that is the joy oh i drank my fool and fell over there is this that people should understand now these nothing nothing of this world can give you neither the money not the physical comfort not the name not the fame nothing those who have understood it what they should do strive to realize that there is something else beyond all these things a full of please full of joy full of peace full of happiness just remove your ego your all desires and you get that that is exactly what sadama krishna is telling that you should go dive into the police then he's mentioning shall i sing well i may then he is mentioning water is water whether it is still or in waves this is the beauty of surama krishna immediately he was telling i don't need to sing why why should i have to sing because already i i got that indication and my mind is already over there then coming down a little he's thinking it's okay whether the water is not moving it is water and maybe because of some desire that is the air making the water moving creating some ripples that's also water so this is the reason the hindus they believe in god in form and god without form and they're very very special we are vedantin we believe that god is without form all hindus believe in that but we take the help of the images of different gods and goddesses so that our little mind our little understanding our little conception about god can take a stick something and over that can concentrate just for the concentration to understanding we take the help of the images but we know it is not the same complete god so this is the beauty of the hinduism from outside it seems oh what is it who is the real god or goddess hundreds and thousands of gods and goddesses are there but we know the hindus they know the god is only one all pervading consciousness without any form but that particular aspect of the supreme truth can be realized with the help of the images so sudama krishna is mentioning shall i sing well i may narendra was seated near the master he was constantly worried about his financial difficulties at home he was now 23 years old srama krishna looked at him intently narendra became vivekananda sannyasi at the age of 24 so this time here the narendra because he is the elder son and his father passed away and his very close relatives they cheated his mother and there was nothing to eat so obviously as a son he was worried the master is telling to narendra smilingly undoubtedly you are call ka kha kha means sky and it indicates that you are the eternal brahman all pervading you are call the second uh that later the ko kha kha means the akash of the sky and that is the infinite but you have to worry about taxes that's the trouble here the taxes means some money to maintain the family sri ramakrishna knew what is going to happen narendra was not knowing so naturally he was oriented suramar krishna knew the what will happen he this will he will his mind will take a turn he will go and then the mother in the form of that supreme the brahman will bless and then the naren will become a sannyasi and his mother and brothers and sisters will be taken care all sudama krishna knew because he is god and the god knew the past knew the present and the future everything opened to him so now he is just joking with narendra you are call but you are worrying about the taxes by taxes mastermind not in those financial difficulties master krishna kishore used to say that he was kaw that is another person he used to say i am means that i am that brahman one day i visited him at his home and found him or it he wouldn't talk to me freely i asked him what's the matter why are you brooding like this the krishna krishna said the tax collector came today he said my pots and pans would be sold at auction because he took some loan couldn't pay obviously from the court that was the order if i didn't pay my taxes that is what i am worrying about i laughed and said how is that you are surely call the akasha let the rascal take away your pots and pans what is that to you so when we say something but can't practice that that is the mockery the one should not do that the krishna kishore was a householder and he used to declare that i am that brahman now this has happened and he cannot truly behave like a nora brahmana it is only the pure-hearted sannyasis i am use the word pure-hearted because if we are trying to be a sannyasi still having some desire for name and fame and then doing these and doing that for that particular purpose the people should know me and all that they they have to wait for the purity and purity means nothing of this world can tempt you so that is called the purity so this way the pure-hearted sannyasians can only say that i am brahman brahmashmi just reading a few upanishads or he listening lecture on that vedanta if one tried to practice that without the basic quality and preparation he will launch to that as the krishna the sudama krishna is mentioning krishna kesha because of this we should learn from that to narendra so i am saying that to you are call why are you so worried don't you know that sri krishna said to arjuna if you have one of the eight cities you may get a little power but you will not realize me the god aim capital the cities means power so that we one can control and here it is telling then then he says by siddhis one may acquire powers strength money and such thing but not god let me tell you something else suramar krishna is mentioning let me tell you something else and this is the topic for today go beyond knowledge and ignorance beyond knowledge and ignorance this is pure vedanta if one is having the conception of knowledge he's also having the conception of ignorance if you know that this is light that means you must have the experience of darkness otherwise how can you compare the moment i say this is light and that is darkness that means i know about darkness duality then when you have realized that everything is brahmana and there you cannot discriminate that this is the family life or this is the worldly life and that is a pure life or the sannyasin's life you cannot do like that after the realization of the brahman which is all pervading there is no difference that's why after observing swami vivekananda for a long time long period of time his disciples sister niberita miss margaret noble she wrote in the introduction to the complete works of swami vivekananda so in him there was no the secret or secular there is no difference the pure thing and the impure thing of the worldly things no everything was the maid of god so that is the realization the go beyond the duality let me tell you something go beyond knowledge and ignorance people say that such and such a such and such a one is a gyani but in reality it is not so gyani means a man of knowledge who is a man of knowledge a person of knowledge one who has understood that the consciousness or realized we should say the consciousness is everywhere and all that we see is nothing but the manifestation of the same consciousness which is named or termed as brahman nothing else everything is nothing but the brahman let's see people may say like that but in reality it is not so bashist now krishna mentioning and with the very famous rishi the bashishta we are studying the yoga bhashishta many of you know this bashishta was a great gyani but even he was stricken with grief on account of the death of his sons that means is my children that conception was there and that shows that knowledge was not there at least for that particular period of time he forgot that this is the way we have to understand this that one who is having this knowledge for him everything is nothing but the manifestation of the same pure consciousness in different forms and the children that we see my son my family the moment we feel like that is duality that means still ignorance is there a me and mind conception that this is really very subtle so it's very difficult to understand but at least intellectually we should try to understand this that there is something which is known as brahman and which is all pervading consciousness which is one without two advaita that is only residing only there and nothing else whatever else that we see is nothing but the creation of maya that's the power of that particular consciousness and that that cover the truth and superimpose something untruth on that and we are affected by that maya and that is why we are seeing the separation and the spirituality is nothing but the practice of understanding this game plan of maya and go beyond to the reality how with the knowledge who will give the knowledge the guru and how the guru can help us by telling that we are that tattwa mercy and how i will practice than the example i was so much afraid of a snake that was on the road that i was traveling and when i was shouting for help then someone came with the torch and with that light i found is only a rope appearing as snake so this world that we see that appears to us is nothing but that rope appearing as snake so when we understand that we go beyond this duality but as a practice practice and practice understanding and practicing with the light of knowledge we should have to understand this this and it is so difficult so sirama krishna is mentioning about the bashist the great rishi the guru of the rogue clan he is also crying for the death of his sons at these the lakshmana said to rama this is amazing rama even the bashist is so grief stricken lakshmana because he knew what is truth rama and lakshmana they started so they knew what is that so when the lakshmana is mentioning why bushish is crying he knew that he's all temporary and rama is telling brother he who has knowledge has ignorance as well he who is aware of light is also aware of darkness he who knows good and also knows bad he who knows happiness also knows misery brother go beyond duality so we have to understand it go beyond duality those who are studying the vedanta the students of vedanta particularly advaita vedanta very fond of listening about the the advaita pradhantic book like panchodashi and then the yogavashishta you have to understand this going beyond the duality if you have the conception that this is the world that means you have the conception also about the idea about the god the duality so this we have to understand yobam everywhere it is me the god when we are approaching through the path of duality that is also the same training same teaching you have to see me everywhere and i am that i am that i am that those who are following the bhagavan krishna but at the same time denouncing oh you are low caste you are low born you are these you are ignorant you are don't come don't come don't touch me i am holier than thou if that is there that means they are not the voters of sri krishna they are not worshiping shri krishna they are simply wasting time they have not understood the sri krishna i am everywhere in different forms in different names that don't see any difference it is all me how a devoted hindu can criticize others can heat others no you cannot so that is the reason the hindus are always they are going on the forbearing no i am not going to hurt anyone because that may be my god into that form i do not know so that's why hindus are always loving caring serving very broad-minded and they always encompass each and everything whoever came you are all the same so in the just like the ocean the different rivers are coming sometime bringing the dirk waters nasty waters and sometime very clear water river ocean is all right welcoming each and everyone come to my bosom come and mix with me that should be the conception of the hinduism the sanatana dharma the vedic religion why because there is no difference the god is everywhere all-pervading the rama is telling to his brother lakshmana brother go beyond duality beyond pleasure and pain beyond knowledge and ignorance to narendra so i am asking you to go beyond both knowledge and ignorance see suramar krishna went back to his small couch the devotees were seated on the floor shurinder sat by his side the master cast an affectionate look on him and began to give him advice now he is giving the attention to surendra and we all know by now that surendra was a government official he used to work in a a big business house that that should endure used to come not that he used to practice meditation or anything but he used to love krishna you know the great faith the salam krishna is a holy person he's just like god his company is sufficient for me that faith was there look at it and most of the time he used to come exhausted in his office and with the cool breeze of the ganga in the chanesha he'll be lying on the floor and sleeping when all the devotees are sitting and listening to the master suramar krishna he will be sleeping when the others will be glancing at him why this man is sleeping here suramar krishna will be like your mother will say no no no he is very tired let him sleep and these will be sufficient for him the company of god that is sufficient it's ramakrishna looking at surah and come come here every now and then come here every now and then nanta used to say that a brass pot must be polished every day otherwise it gets stained one should constantly live in the company of a holy man that means regularly they should keep touch they should keep uh then slowly slowly they can develop that uh you know what actually that truly the religion is so unless you come regularly listening to the coming means coming to the idea not that physically you have to come but you regularly listen to the talks trying to understand that read the book and then sometimes you are asking question and clarifying your all doubts so by that way slowly you are developing the faith and love for god then also at the same time you are practicing and practicing by that way it will be possible one should constantly live in the company of holy men renunciation of lost and gold is for the sannyasins it is not for you he is talking about the devotees the householder devotees it's not for you lost and gold is necessary for you so you must have something and that you should have a comfortable life it's for the sannyasins unleashing should not go for that the two different type the mentalities are different thoughts are different now and then you should go into solitude and call on god with a yearning heart your renunciation should be mental you are only thinking that i am going to renounce and i am not attached to these and that though i am having my property my this bank balance and all this but i know that this is the time limit this much is sufficient for me and the balance i'm going to give in charity and if the relatives are there if they need i distribute the money among the relatives so by that way and sometimes one should be very cautious about that if i am giving someone who is misutilizing the money maybe drinking and going to the bad places and just because he is my son or daughter or maybe a close relative out of emotion if i give that money because of the misutilization the wrong utilization that charity will have no benefit so one must be very careful about that too but then giving aways and why because i don't so mentally detached it is also a practice thank you friends now i think we should stop over here and we will read you know next wednesday from the page 696 the gospel of suramar krishna is there any question so the first question is from biswarup goes he's asking is it possible to surrender myself hopefully like girish course to ramakrishnadev of course but this depends on the practice and surrender means what you are surrendering your ego that is the surrender the girish also gave the ego now i am giddy she forgot that and he used to think that i am the servant of the master that's all so if you start thinking i am the son of the master i am the servant of the master and whatever i should do before that i will go i meditate i pray and whatever the thought comes in my mind i should try to do that i am not going to take any decision because i am not the owner of this body and mind the owner of this body and mind is bhagavan sirama krishna you can do that thank you srima biswas is asking what is duality a duality means god is there and i am here this is called duality the non-duality means i and my god are one and duality means god is separate i am separate that is duality thank you the next question is from dev janitor she is asking how to concentrate on god staying in a unhealthy atmosphere from close person yeah yeah i can understand dev journey this is really very difficult really very difficult so that's why bhagavan si rama krishna is suggesting that you should go to a secluded place near gyan you should go to a secluded place now and then and there you pray to the god pray to the mother and you tell this problem to them and you will find that slowly the solution will come and that prayer is very very powerful so you can try that also going to a secluded place somewhere where you can be alone and pray to the mother akshay is asking revered sir how to have more faith actually this is you know as as you are going on listening to this type of discourses then reading the book and listening or best part if you are reading the biographies of the great sages then you can develop the more faith and if you analyze your life i don't know how old you are but see a middle aged person if you are analyzing how i am surviving millions are dying but i am surviving there must be someone who is protecting me and i should give the service to to that god who is protecting me and this is the way the faith develops thank you then let us friends let us chant this mantra and we conclude ananta is [Music] [Music] [Applause]
