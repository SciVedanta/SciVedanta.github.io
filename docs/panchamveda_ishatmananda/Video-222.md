[223: Panchama Veda 223 : Sri Ramakrishna The God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dmtxxn5IOE)

good evening double cut ham rhythm dr. G venom copy be rewritten Calma sharper Shravana Mangalam sorry madam boobie grinning de bourree dodging ah today is a very special day serum - na who never could say anything about himself and always tried to hide himself so he is now expressing himself to a very close devotees and why I should say close devotees there are other people who are also there but in a wonderful mood in extracting mood he is going telling them but this is the page number five eight seven of the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna we will read from here it is one thing to learn about God from the Scriptures and quiet another to see so this is a wonderful statement when we read about God in the scriptures we develop some idea some conception and we think that is God why we differ almost each and every individual is different as differing with others about God why because he or she is thinking about God after reading the scripture from the books of the holy people and then developing a conception so they're thinking God is like this God is like that God cannot be like this God cannot be like that but once in a petitioner he is telling that that is completely one thing between you see God when you realize God when you become yourself God there is a completely different experience naturally they're putting changes when you hear about the place you read in the book in the geography book and you see the pictures you listen to the people who have visited that place but when you go to that place experience yourself that's completely different so that is the idea that is the thing and Saddam efficient is telling that there to learn about God from the scripture and quite another to see the Scriptures only give hints therefore to read the great three scriptures is not necessary so when we go on reading different type of scriptures what happened our mind goes wandering into these and in that and by that way our focus is lost so it says it's better to read only one or two Scripture understand that and all the time this is the one with Ramakrishna stilling and then he is telling the master went into an ecstatic mood that ceramic is 'no he went into this cities is a very very very special in ceramic krishna he was just not not talking joking and suddenly he goes to a very high spiritual mood when he goes to that particular mood and he comes with the truth blessed that those who were there just before him they listened to him he in that mood the master went into an ecstatic mood well watching the evening worship of Kali in the company of the devotees those who have visited the dictionary you know the the big huge big compound at the Masters room in in one corner Kali temple in another Colonel used to walk and then he was watching the are the evening ality it says that when there people are singing and the oddity is going on that time one should not meditate the other one should look at the picture because that is the time the main joy that expresses through that images are the pictures so he went over there and went into that ecstatic mood he was in no condition even to salute the image because external that consciousness was not at all there very carefully he returned to his room with the devotees and said he was still in an ecstatic mood he spoke to them while in that state slowly bringing it down and talking to them how it is we get a glimpse from the bhagavad-gita and afterwards in the Mahabharata when all this war was over in the Arjuna he requested the Krishna to tell that other word Gita once again the bhagavad-gita which was delivered to him to the Arjuna by Shri Krishna in the battlefield and after the battle was over they won the battle and after such a then he say Krishna can you please repeat what you said at that time the reply of the Krishna was I cannot because I was in that particular mood from where all this thinking this human body and through this human body is very peculiar we won't be able to understand some of the people they will doubt about it but this is really true when the mind goes into that the truth comes the flow comes and whatever you say that is very beneficial for the people who can accept it so Christian couldn't do that it couldn't repeat that because he was not in that mood see Ramakrishna in from that note he comes down and he is telling in the room was a man about 20 years of age who was a relative of the mukajee's and was very much devoted to master the Salam Krishna used to like him so he is telling master to hurry in an ecstatic mood take your initiation after getting your mother's permission this initiation is very important why because you are taking and see the what be careful about taking the initiation we can go to any person now it is innumerable number people are everywhere they're giving the initiation without knowing what exactly the initiation sometimes those who are practicing yoga they also said we have got the initiation those helped only they are practicing some of the physical exercises even than this enemy guard initiation but that is not initiation initiation is particularly for the development of the spiritual strength and that comes from the Guru and the Guru tradition and Serrano Vishnu will tell what is this cool tradition afterwards a few lines after we can't do that particular word what it says and he is telling take your initiation after getting your mother's permission why mother's permission now after nowadays in the modern time after 18 years you can take your own decision but in those days in the beginning of the 19th century so people were very well connected the family a mother the father or any senior person and that is the Indians society the custom you have to take permission for everything from the senior one mother was there so to take them permission from the matter I couldn't give him the mantra - I said I would initiate him say young Krishna say I couldn't give him the mantra then he say masters they're telling to that person I am seeing these - you believe my world there is not show or deceit here this is the guru is he in his character in his behavior in his attitude in his life he is not deceiving anyone there's not deceit sometimes we it comes in the TV or whatever suddenly it it will pop up an advertisement when you were seeing the news and senility come up so much of money they're spending on advertisement can you imagine so when you were listening or to the reading the news and it comes up and it goes for long time maybe a minute or so that long advertisement means how much money they have spent and Guru is sitting in a nice condition and sitting by the side of the river the tree the birds and animals as if so how attachment why he should have to give that but is men so this is the problem if the people can understand that they'll say okay thank you you are a good man active II suppose but I'm not going to take this decision from you and I'm going to receive the instruction from you so who can give the instruction through instruction one who is not that at cinema business telling not sure the cover name in Hindi Nastase a no-show at all and not deceit he will never do anything to deceit a person why it is not necessary as because the Guru the instructed the teacher is not accepting these were these universe as true as real so obviously why we should be so careful about the popularity and all those things it is not necessary if people the counter is good if they don't come ok with the God's will alabanza Ramakrishna whom he loved he is telling to dead I am saying this to you and this you means actually the Priya the prema card that's how blessed he is in the state of my mind believe my words there is no show or deceit here I just say to the Divine Mother a few moments earlier he was attending the prayer perhaps that time he said to the divine mother that is disclosing I just say to the divine mother Oh mother made those who come here referring to himself through sincere attraction obtain perfection those who come here to the ideology of noggins Ram Krishna what is the ideology of the ancien Tichenor purity love unselfishness there is a purity why because it is completely God and nothing else when the world comes in the mind the name and mine and that means ego is there otherwise why it will be and when the ego is absent what remain only the Hartman and that is why it is pure Atman is always pure so he says in this way that completely and then he is telling through the sincere attraction the people they are getting attracted to different type of people why because according to her mental condition some people are thinking if I go and he keeps his hand on my head all my problem will be solved so he goes to that not forgot realization for solving the problem that's all nothing bad it's okay what is all just beginning maybe but those who are really sincere want to get rid of this but then death and Burton did this circle after circle the shara Baqarah six types of changes in the body mind again taking some form somewhere suffering again why should i when they understand this then he said sufficient enough I don't need it that is called sincere and if they do not know I like to go and have some idea these and that experience these experience there then what I was just reading in the newspaper very unfortunate in the California that is a so the fire has come and it is in the billion years area the people are leaving their houses one person has given the name is a very famous and he constructed a big building of eight bedrooms he left that and with his children and wife going on knocking the different hotels rooms only to get the chance to stay the night and man who is having a building which cost billion and he is now going door to door to different because all the waters are booked so look at the condition anytime anything may happen we do not know what is to happen and just because I am a rich man just because I have constructed a uu building and then I am saying no not at all anything may happen any time and if we understand these this temporariness then we go to God and say God this is all temporary whatever we make god forbid that building should not be destroyed that shouldn't be burned but it is terrible fire is going on so this happen and naturally I should not be attracted to the worldly properties and things and comfortable thing is ok that much why should I have to spend so much of money so this way we have to understand sincerely coming to the god of insalaum - now I have given the title of the today star ceramic dish knew that God I am definite it but I have a hundred percent faith the salon Krishna is God and when sadhana business speaks about God about the truth it is so simple and so direct and so easy to understand but if you read the scripture just as an example I will read at the eighth verse of the issue Upanishad as a very famous supination ischial Keynesian it talks about the art man and it gives what all the idea it goes on giving as maximum possible so it goes on giving like this Safari yoga chakram a column of Brenham a snobby Rashid down above victim could be menisci Paribas a Yahoo guitar katate at Todd the other dog Shosh Aditya Samar para now some idea how much you could understand sir means eat that the Hartman Maria God all pervasive shukran pure açaí embody list a Burnham endless us Nevada without cinnamons that should dumb dangerous about a victim without seen kabhi amnezia menisci ruler of the mine and Perico transcendence I am both self existent now these are the words people are reading the Oh Ganesha and then they through meditating on the venetie trying to understand the meaning of fate but here how many of us would be able to understand this it needs the intellect like Shankar Acharya to understand and to realize this is really very difficult and that is where the God Himself comes down take the human form leave just like us with us and thing he says have a sincere mind and come to God what will happen success what in success spirituality and what only you need is the field and faith in the words of God that's what he is telling believe my words to whoever comes and then he wants to begin the life up in the spiritual life I always suggest please read the backdrop of Sri Ramakrishna and also the Gospel of John Krishna his teachings I could suggest this book that book and then so many other then people usually they feel the great joy our pride to code some big names who did that that they have not realized Souls they're good writers they have command over the language and they express things in a very nice way but they are not real realized Souls why should we unnecessarily spend my time and energy to reading that I want to know the truth and that is called Scripture that is called spiritual instruction after listening after hearing after reading real inspiration comes that is if you read the small book some of the instructions but from Hebrew man and the demon Raj you will feel yes these are the words Salaam Remi Vivekananda's words if we yes Marshall dominative is so simple but her instructions yes see ramakrishna says he says i talked to the mother divine mother o mother made those who come here millions are coming it produced so many thousands it's so difficult to control the crowd over there if you go to the Ganesha so difficult to control the crowd and say you come here true sincere attraction this is the important through sincere attraction attraction why I like to realize God that is the attraction and nothing else I like to realize God I like to see God in this life I'd like to stand face-to-face with God in this life in the Upanishads they say yah-tchi debated at usamos do not cheat aha a Bailey more tea - tea is a great loss if you cannot realize God in this very life because there's news there's no certainty what is going to happen after this life so that is the reason and Saddam additional says the sings here extraction often perfection perfection means understand the truth so what will happen got realization what is God realization obtaining the perfection what is the perfection I am that one and there is not two so Salaam addition to use this word obtain perfection so this is very very important except got realization no one can become perfect why little ego will be there when the little ego will be there so obviously you will never be able to be perfect after the god realization then only the Eagle will go down mind Rukavina atop city was seated on the veranda conversing with the Ramla has try and others the master called to him from his room he went out quickly to broad-minded in my master to mind sit down and listen to my words so this is called compassionate guru mohandro is a doctor coverage in a traditional way of potential medicine used to practice now this person he has gone but instead of listening to Quran Salam Krishna he is sitting outside and talking with some other people Sam Krishna calling him come over here he didn't call off a drug if we notice as I was also there and some other people are also there he called only Mahindra come here why that is the God's compassion those who are really good but somewhat little different way God comes out in the world through the guru and he says come here don't go over there don't mix with those people just like the mother protecting and the mothers they always say the parents they would be all the time guiding the children to don't go and mix with those people not that they're eating them but they know that their influence may ruin the child so that is the reason because of the experience to the cinema Krishnan knew this manners really develop the sincerity and now he is going and wasting the time and Salaam business did that moon whatever he is telling if the come and listen it will be good for them to history sit down and listen to my words mine I was a little embarrassed is a Tao master to the devotee Salaam peace to to the devotees God can reserved in different ways God can be served in different ways then he mentioned santa dasya sakhya vatsalya Maduro all these different approaches as a Rishi's they are Shanta they understand the God's work they believe in existence of God they'll also be that whatever is happening all around us by the will of God we have nothing to do just like the witness do you see and no reaction at all good bad these the Bree she's just observed and - nothing that's called Shanda - you always feel they going to serve the God I like to clean this I like to do to do that that is always there and third is secure as a like a frame the swami vivekananda used to call an American lady ten time so and she was by each the tension maybe vacant and death but she used to say that I am the friend of Swami Vivekananda and when they afterwards when Vivekananda passed away and she's to go and visit the balloon Mart then this twerks man what is your age usually the people are not supposed to ask the age of the lady but this to us then choose to say only six years or seven years something like that why the tea I made that my friend Vivekananda from the I was reborn so my previous age all those years I don't count so this is the love I am reborn so this is reborn is possible in the Shakya in the Arjuna also in bhagavad-gita we find after a long discussion then he says whatever you see I believe and parts earlier this is sometimes the motherly way of worshiping God the mother never care for the whole God is a big person all pervading powerful only the mothers are what will happen to God I saw a small movie and just before the 2040 symbol usually that ever becomes I was watching then the family a poor family they went to a Sun mana charge and that Christmas even it was snowing very cold outside the people with heavy trays there all game and then they were attending the church sermon and young little boy you so ain't with his parents and he was looking at the baby chart that Jesus just an image the small little baby lying down and having no clothings all people are praying to oh jesus oh God but this boy was feeling oh it is so cold why they have kept that without any proper clothings she may he may catch cold so what he he was constantly trying to go to me and to that because that was a decoration so that you know the tattoos hurt and also many other people are there the poor the condition and the Jesus is lying down little baby that's the image this boy he loved so much it is not only mother you see how the motherly her then he was thinking no I should have to do something because he's suffering these people the elderly people who is going on watching the faces our people closing their eyes praying to God no one is caring about so ultimately when everything was over they closed the door he somehow hid himself inside so what I can remember and then when everybody has gone he went and took the Jesus and then opened the door and went to his own house then his own craters and other dresses he put that into the Jesus then his elderly the sister came in what your dream see Jesus they kept it like this how the little boy can sleep and if you must be suffering the thief's little sister also joined in a key years so let us go and keep him back otherwise the pastor will be handling so they went back when they went back then they heard people here and there they're talking about the Jesus and one lady she was telling you won't believe Jesus came and told me I'm leaving this place well then this happening and she was all imagining things and telling Jesus is not there Jesus is lost no one then they could not find the Jesus they were thinking what happened then the old priest also came back what happened this - when they are going and a Polish man he found this - slowly trying to enter into the church and he followed them they found that he they are taking out the little Jesus and trying to keep over there they were halstead but all people including the priest say yes no no no they should not be punished for this but this should be praised for their loved God we already people we talk about God but we never feared - sometimes when you go through these it is very warm room we have to feel that God is sleeping shall he do it or not is that - room is sufficiently heated for the God can I also live in this condition that is Karla that's called feeling to be also there's a wonderful there's so many incidences in the life of Ramakrishna and his name was given best shaman awakened as Ramakrishna Ananda all his joy is in Slama Krishna so that is called a dog and Sudama Krishna is telling like this this is called the love for God sometimes he is mentioning sometimes Balarama looked on Krishna as a frame Balarama is the disciple he was a rich man and landlord but very humble program all the time he is to dress in such a way the people used to feel that he is a servant very humble they used to be and Ramakrishna is praising him but around looked on Krishna as a friend they were Krishna bhakta sometimes he would think he was Krishna's umbrella that is holding the umbrella on Krishna or he is lying down and Krishna he's using his soul as a carpet and on there the Christian is working he serve Krishna in all possible ways was salam krishna hinting at his own state of mind why it was describing the different attitude of a lover of God Master Masha is thinking commenting he described the gentleness trees spiritual moves chettinad II used to experience three moves in the import mood he would be observed in Samadhi that this is to be noted particularly as the same so when the spiritual boon there are three different steps the first the highest the completely marched in God no consciousness and no body consciousness and no external consciousness nothing they remain only that consciousness and nothing else Shami be vacant and then he has a point and there he is giving what happens in deep meditation ultimately in his poem he mentioned there will be by I I float not very strong but still that little eye is there I mean that I also goes away happens oh no only those who realises can only experience that it cannot be expressed no one can express it it can tell it was a prawn poach a jar in Bengali in the claim the one who realized that only they could understand that the Chitina dramatist is telling that he used to go into that state unconscious of the outer world external world in the semi-conscious moon you dance in ecstasy but could not talk expression was impossible but joy was so much and along with the joy along with experience of the divinity there was also experience of the worldliness so he used to express the joy with by dancing dancing in the conscious mode you'd sing the glories of God and ultimately when it comes down then only he will sing and in the baton today always give the example Japeth of necessity and to do the two real condition and the fourth as the vedanta says that to decondition salaam krishna explained the third there no experience of to only one plane toboggan de tuléar condition I and you I and dog is absent so that is the time no one can talk no one can sing no one can dance no one can do anything because it is all in that equilibrium condition then when it comes down a little bit down then little in the shrapnel Jakob addition something is there but not that true but still that joy is there the feeling of their joy at at the same time a little conditioned feeling of the world thing he is dancing expressing the great joy and when the person is mad enjoy can't do express that in words and then finally when the jacket and the body and mind consciousness continually is talking about God the devotees you are listening to my words try to assimilate them the friends sometimes some of the groups the very sincere groups in different places and small very small group in North Dakota and then Minnesota Minneapolis and also Detroit then Ohio and different places they are developing then I'll be going also to visit them Huntsville so these people they come twice or once in a month and the seed and the reed they ask me what should we do then I always tell Reed ten minutes from the Gospel of John Krishna at the biography of saddam krishna after ten minutes close the book meditate for five minutes assimilation a constantly reading and then finish this book what next what next this is not like that is the assimilation what ceramic krishna still today we read the five pages and from the five pages we find this is a sincere person going to to see ramakrishna with a sincere mind accepting selfishness truth is God and then it is sure that he is going to get the God realization why because the God has promised and what is the sincerity hundred percent faith in the existence of Salah vishna and why should I laughs Ramakrishna not just because of this picture not because of these are there but slam kishna is the embodiment of truth he is the embodiment of love he is the embodiment of unselfishness completely free from ego these I like so my old sincere effort to reach to those who ever comes the two young people that sister and brother I really wondered so they came and they were asking the Swami ji can you please still what is God and what is the difference between Matt dua and this advaita and all this I was wondering how these young people they are learning maybe the family tradition is there so then I'm told you just read from the bhagavad-gita they have read bhagavad-gita even the seven standard boy he was noting him and when I say God or Gita yes si no I told the 12th chapter yes si him no sir I was really appreciating there's a great amount of the parents to give them this idea I told since you know it read once again that from thirteen to nineteen slow curse of the bhagavad-gita the twelfth chapter and the twelfth chapter there the God is telling God that particular person whom God really cares like love why these qualities so the list of the qualities then in the again the 16 chapter whole 16 chapter except the three versus he is going on giving the description of the bad things why because unless and until we know the bad things we won't be able to appreciate the good and then we have to have the compare oh yes God said these are the things and some of them is presenting me I have to be careful to eradicate these bad feelings bad ideas from me so that is the help the God is doing but the first three verses he has given 26 good qualities whoever comes to me I say please read this - from the bhagavad-gita and let us try to develop a few good qualities from this 26 list if we can do that that will be the God realization why the mind will be completely free from any attachment so this what province Ramakrishna says ad put aside all duties and pray to God this is the instruction of the Raghavan see Ramakrishna the moment it is dusk immediately put aside all duties and prayed to God one is reminded of him by Ternes at the approach of the darkness one things I could see everything a moment ago who has brought about this change he is giving a hint and this is the phenomena every day we are experiencing of course the cities like this react grants country there is no darkness almost but some of the places I have noticed people here they like the darkness the natural way so on the street there is no light though there's a rich people's area and inside the house team life but that gives one shoe I don't know I am NOT practicing spirituality rather doing something else but spiritual people the moment it is dirt I was looking at those things I could notice all the seeing that suddenly changes come that means day and night it under that is all is coming in my life too and sometimes I am happy sometimes all miserable so it may happen anytime the only way is to go to God the ceramic isne he is telling muslims musulmans put aside all activities and say their prayers at their appointed times some krishna is appreciating life and then really sincere even the rich educated and poor uneducated all they will follow this and that's why shall I become the also appreciated this quality of them how in the whole society this thing has been given to them and I noticed in the Middle East also almost in every locality in every block then the mosque in the corner when even from the main mosque according to the time there will be called the ajahn immediately have to stop the car by the side of the road and you have to go to the nearby mosque and you have to sit down were they ever prayer maybe ten minutes five times a day whole society is following this what happens when you are praying even for 10 minutes but that time at least your mind goes to God and they'll be the words almost all of them they memorize and they'll be telling the God is one and there is no to God is all pervading God is all love Exeter etc remember in God and the five times a day means that's a very good practice and in the morning I do and the night again I do and in between I forget so that is the reason the Muslims they incorporated this system five times ten minutes I have seen in the Bangladesh in the moving train there is a special bogie left for that and they have the arrow din every other bogies for the mosque for the prayer you can go over there so the vegetable train so people will go and they will play even in the moving train all of them they will go and they sit down they play every one of them how much sincerity how much success that is not the question question is the habit the question is how they are developing cinema Krishna appreciated that even the Muslims at we then Mukerji is asking reading yourself is it good to practice japa please our skin and ceramic is new yes one attains God through japa the Japanese repetition of the God's holy name and that's why the mantra diksha the God's holy name any time you can do any time the good will say okay in the morning under the neck times and in the evening hundred eight times taking the name of God undeterred eight times it doesn't take more than five minutes maybe in the beginning when slowly slowly you are pronouncing maybe a hardly ten minutes but if you slowly develop the speed and the practice and constantly going all taking the name of God that is called japa you will feel that when you are sleeping that time also the Momentum's Klim probe will find that subconscious mind that name is going on and create effect to see ramakrishna stealing that yes it is by repeating the name of God secretly and in solitude one receives divine grace the words of God the Salama Krishna is the god he is telling this to the truth then comes is vision you go on repeating the name of God and a time will come you will start seeing gods and goddesses then come the visions suppose there is a big piece of timber lying under water and first to the land with a chain by proceeding along the chain link by link you will at last touch of the timber is under the water you cannot see it but the only way to reach the timber is that chain link by link if you go slowly slowly then time will come when he will reach the timber the example is just like that there's a part you don't have any idea of God and where it is how it is you don't know instead of doubting have little faith in the words of the Guru and the mantra that you have received and grew on repeating that mantra just all that and nothing else Raghavan sit down Krishna say not this guru or that good but once Ramakrishna is dealing just take the name of God and with a faith and sincerity you will see God you will reach God and this moment what we need two things faith and practice faith in the words of Pergamon still our vision of the God and then practice taking the holy name then he is dipping higher than worship is Java and the eternal worship that we are doing higher than that is the chapel higher than Java is meditation why the Java the name of God and meditation feeling the presence of God within higher the meditation is power power means transforming into that higher condition another muhabba a DePrima the stiffest II when the mahabhava comes that is only for the avatars art many people cannot have the maha father only Chetan know my privilege to have the mahabhava and the prema another one Saddam history is to have the mahabhava and the prema it's not possible for the ordinary people to reach up to death but he can go up to power J Dilla they've had prema when one attains prema one has the room to die God the premium is that love then the God is always with you so this is how it happens mother what a small-minded fellow he is now this small passage I read like unglued he looked at the hot rod and Hydra we know is a wonderful character is to live with Pokemon still on Krishna is to read lot of scriptures part at the back of his mind it was always there to express that to the devotee to impress this that the great scriptural knowledge on the devotees to get the attention of the devotees friends this is the problem when you come to the guard we start with that humbleness we'll learn something we read something then we start thinking I can teach why not and from then all this day we used to go up and then from there down begins I can teach I can tell maybe five people are wandering and then following and so happy why ego subtle ego and I am thinking no I am talking about God only but who asked you to talk about God and how you are talking if anybody's questioning you and not listening are you not feeling angry so these are the way we have to test ourself discussion is one thing but instruction giving instruction is another thing and it is present almost in a everyone why ego a little we read little we hear little we'll learn and immediately we can talk we can give about the sermon about that without practicing so Salam o Krishna stating this to Hofstra who had this characteristics is to read aloud he knew many Scripture but the problem was he always is to think why people are not coming to me Schramm kishna has not read any book but people are going to him but he was God himself attraction was completely different and here only I have learned and mucked up something memorize something now that and impress people here it says love of God - huzzah some distance telling when it is intense and spontaneous is called Raghav of the love of God intense and spontaneous we are not trying to develop love it is called rather bhakti formal devotion depends on scriptural instructions it comes it goes but rather bhakti is like a stone emblem on the Sheba of Toshiba that has sprung up out of the art that is the string right there it cannot remove it then Haslam is army when expression okay maybe it will not be like that these this last few words are so important one day I was returning from the Pine Grove still the Pine Grove small patch still their induction Isha when they saw you telling your beads as well he's telling the huzzah I saw you I said to the Divine Mother now I have marked this verse modern what a small-minded fellow he is - Hara is telling he leaves here still he practices japa with the rosary whoever comes here referring to himself will have his spiritual consciousness awakened all at once I should conclude here and we should meditate on these words friends this is the last class because of the and quickly the darkness is coming it is difficult for the our senior citizens people to drive and come in this class and slowly the winter is also coming this is the time people go out of Chicago so we have decided that we will stop suspend these our Tuesday and Friday classes because after the prayer only it becomes the night so we will again resume this class and generally March from March on the world I also send you I have already send you the number to pull a team there they will find that so this is the last class and of all these lectures have available in YouTube and also in the cities and if you read the book and listen to the description there are discussions it will be beneficial and when he tells the Hofstra why you think in the name of God by Counting the beads that means when you are in the presence of God the presence of God he must have to feel that is the main thing hasta the poor person of course he was blessed he only enacted that role what was given back to him by God himself he is a he read scripture he wanted to realize God but ego took him out though used to leave the wheel God just won another wall apart if you go to see the Dutch nation ceramic kitchen was inside the room and he used to live outside the room on the open space and just one small wall apart but he could not realize god and he used to think is to take the name of God meditating Salam Krishna told mother why are you doing this living here can't you understand this so strong Krishna is God we should believe it we should follow him [Music] dong gun trigger big ground way he shall but our permission the party you that said three down Krishna but Hamas too our Sunday discos Sunday service will continue up to December and then January and February
