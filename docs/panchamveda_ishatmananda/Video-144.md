[145. Panchama Veda 145- The Gospel of Sri RamaKrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdqMC_UsVto)

and this month and begin the rocket our madam doctor Giovanna Kobe be really dumb calm Asha Bahama Shravana Mangalam srimad Artem Ravi green on te Bora garden aha now the last time when you were we were reading we found that ceramic busines was telling a story that he heard from his guru totapuri G and that story actually to explain as Swami Vivekananda said each soul is potentially divine and rather we can say that it shows that each and every soul is having that divinity and in a very beautiful way how we are - we are divine having the divine power we are constantly thinking that we are very weak a sinner and human being so that is the true the story Salameh fishness guru who was an updo 18 total Arijit he was narrative and the story goes like this once the tigress attacked a hard of goats a hunter saw heart from a distance and killed her the tightness was pregnant and gave birth to a cop as she expired the car began to grow in the company of the goals at first it was notched by the three goats and later on as a groovy girl it began to eat grass and eat like the goals actually the cop became a big tiger but still it is grass and Britain when attacked by other animals it would run away like the goals one day a tiger attacked the heart it will amaze to see a tiger in the heart eating grass and running away like the goats at its approach it left her it left the goals and caught hold of the grass eating tiger which began to bleed and try to run away but the fierce looking tiger dragged it to the water and sailed now look at your face in the water you see you have the same face like me it is exactly like me next it pressed a piece of meat into his mouth at first the grass eating tiger refused to eat the meat then he got the taste of the meat and realized it at last the tiger said to the gossiping tiger what a disgrace you lived with the goals and aid class like them and the other was really ashamed itself in this story Kazama Krishna himself is explaining again it says eating grass like enjoying the worldly life the bleach and run away like a goat is to behave like an ordinary man going away with the new Tiger is like taking shelter with the Guru whoever gains want spiritual consciousness and recognizing him alone as one related to see one's face rightly is to know once real the beautiful story Xiaomi Buganda also depo repeated this story in his own way a little change but the main story is just like this and that he says when you go to a realized soul a guru he can only introduce you that you are that self in the Vedanta most of you know a hombro march√© me that sama see that is the conception I am that grumman he were also the same this way the Guru and the shisha has ordinary human being constantly thinking about himself that I do not know anything I won't be able to do anything and that weakness all these type of things are there but the wind the Guru teaches him the only things that you see the grass that you are eating or trying to you are getting afraid these are all weaknesses give away that what the Ramakrishna say to the devotees why to everything the spiritual power see Ramakrishna Studer there were silence all around disturbed only by the gentle rustling of the pine needles and the marveling of the Ganges in one place just today I was reading the one gentleman is mentioning about the beauty of the cat America each and everything has been depicted as if he is showing us in the movie through words how nicely each and every step is describing when he was telling like this those whose mind is pure and here they are trying very hard to realize God they immediately understanding that what a foolishness the Guru is here and I know the truth that I am the god but still because of my weakness for some attractions for these worldly things which is so temporary I cannot realize myself when he was thinking in this way obviously all of them they were silent and that they were hearing the disturbed only by the gentle rustling of the pine needles and the murmuring of the Ganges the master wing to the Panchavati and the into his room talking all the while with aim the master Marcia who is noting the disciple following him here master my said sometimes he has mentioned himself as aim or the master of the disciple like this followed him fascinated master Marshall actually explaining about himself fascinated because the moment he heard the story the simple small story study for the children in our that the book all the pictures are there children read the story but for them the meaning is completely different but the man who is trying to realize God the moment he hears like this I am that there immediately within his mind the transformation comes and he thinks that while still I am bound so fascinated with the story at the pancha bhutas ramakrishna dust with his forehead the raised platform around the banyan tree those who have visited the destination that still it is there ceramic is nice to practice the austerity over there there is still holy people they go they look at it immediately they remember the some ones that over here days of the days bonds and years together practicing spirituality still the Ganga is flowing the holy leave River still those trees are there the place is also there only we have to practice like that that gives the inspiration this was the place of his intense spiritual discipline where he had wept bitterly for the vision of divine mother where he had held intimate command communion with heart and where he had seen many divine forms master machine three lines describing about the scene Asia the master and the EM past the cluster of the buckle tree and came to the new Hobbit now about is a place where the in the olden days is to keep the musicians to play the music and then afterwards man masa de magnete became the she's to live into that the nowadays very famous now the moment they say destination Hubbard immediately people the associated with Ramakrishna movement they know that is the place where Marshall Adam unity be used to live hosta was there and we know that that character the special character Hara here Raghavan see Ramakrishna just me after him another person huzzah he was also reading the scriptural books studying there but his mind was filled with worldliness he was constantly trying to ingress people so that he can earn some money whereas he is speaking about the devotion a mainly hustlers to speak about the knowledge but his mind was all the time thinking for the money so the hafsa cinema krishna saw him master said to him don't eat too much and give up this crazy crazed for outer cleanliness as Rama was to do like that people with grace do not attain knowledge just in one lines Ramakrishna's guiding him if you are having this type of peculiarity you will never be able to realized the brahman you will never get the knowledge follow conventions only as much as necessary don't go to excess that is the warning for those who are trying to practice spirituality that is why again and again I say the gospel is the guide those who are really things here in the spiritual path gospel is the guide see how the excess that we do many of the times we do so much of excess some people rebating four or five times and every time they are changing their dresses every time they are thinking that this we should do that we should do the food the clothing the behavior constantly the much excess we do we go every month of ponta so here his master is giving he is actually telling to huzzah but that goes to each and every one of us who are interested the master entered his room and sat on the couch see Ramakrishna was resting after his midday meal when Surendra Rahm and other devotees arrived from Calcutta salindra afterwards we will know about him some Christmas to love him very much he was a very rich person and naturally when they're very unstructured family rich family he never bothered about the God or the spirituality so the his life wasn't different but at the age of 30 he came in contact with cinema Krishna and immediately he changed he lived only 40 years in those days longevity was like that he lived only 40 years but within this 40 years 10 years he came in contact with ceramic dish now and God totally changed so we will read about the surrender a little afterwards round round doctor damn doctor has donated his own property in Calcutta now on this that property is a huge awesome Ramakrishna mission Optima is there and we call it Joe goes down because sadhana Krishna told this is the place for meditation it was so lonely that Joe was done mod and like balloon mod in the jihad and not also the release of Ramakrishna is there and he will wonder there a temple small temple is dedicated in the name of Rama Chandra doctor his disciple he was the first person who came to see Ramakrishna and started telling the society about see Ramakrishna it was about 1 o'clock while him was strolling alone under the pine trees Harish came there and told him that the master wanted him in his room someone was going to read it from the shiva some Higa a proof book containing instructions about yoga and the six centers that is the spiritual life holy company what is the holy company when a person comes to the asana or the holy person but actually they should do reading holy books either together or alone or quietly sitting and meditating or quietly all alone stalling so that is that is the way one should get the benefit the Salama krishna was introducing this beautiful way these people came all the way from Calcutta deduction nature and Calcutta it was for distance and particularly in those days difficult to reach the destination when the Ramachandra came rom doctor he was a doctor and shrenger he was a very rich man at the same time a devotee magistrate so when deben ceramic isne had someone to read from the shiver Sumida different type of books his days to read and see ramakrishna is to explain afterwards on his own realization and when Heda entered he hard ceramic crystal the master as he is mentioning talking completely in the different way they were supposed to read the book on yoga here the dhamma krishna is talking about the devotion the gopis cherished ecstatic love for Krishna there are two elements in such love - and - Ramakrishna himself in started I and mine that should not be practiced but here the devotee he is selling - and - how is the feeling that Krishna will be ill if I do not serve him that is the iris this eye is not the eye of the ego associated with this body mind complex this eye is associated with the devotion love and that is manifesting as in a motherly way if I do not take care of God then what will happen to God can you imagine the way the Hindus the thought no fear at all about the God just opposing fearing for the God because the God cannot take care of himself I have to take care that is the way approach to God and constantly thinking I Ness and - eyeness is the feeling that krishna will be healed if i do not serve in in this attitude the devotee does not look upon his idol as god but my own but my baby my child i have to take care - is the feeling that the beloved is my own just as a mother carrying the baby if i am not taking care who will look after the baby so it is my baby and i have to take care I and mine which are the causes of bondage is completely changing and becoming the source of liberation the Gopi has such a feeling of - towards Krishna that they would place their subtle bodies under his feet lift his soul should get heart that they say the wind they saw the Krishna is running walking here and there this to feel that I should go and lie down at the feet of the Krishna so that seed should not get hot can he imagine the devotion constantly forgetting his own self and completely dedicating now the Ramakrishna is mentioning your show the remarked I do not understand youth choice Chaitanya Chintamani Krishna chintamani the word that used change someone is the one who is thinking about the old universe is taking care protecting the team car money Krishna I do not understand how it is to me he H capital is simply go father go follow the image of baby Krishna so this Gopala I can understand gopis are also telling like this oh where is Krishna our beloved where is Krishna our sweeter they were not conscious of he's being God so the moment we think God is there is a distance and we are afraid of God when I am serving something will it please the God or otherwise if I do something maybe the God will be angry I will be punished no care about that because of the love tremendous love I had the authority to do this and I know the God on mind the cinema dish nur is introducing this form we have the pure love for God forgetting that is God rather cherishing the idea that God belongs to me I have to take care of God and constantly in every moment it is like a small child saying my daddy he is giving the example how this go piece they were behaving if someone says to the child no he is not your daddy the child will argue and no yes he is my daddy see how he has observed the behavior of the children and that he is utilizing to give this example God incarnated himself as man behaves exactly like man that is why it is difficult to recognize an incarnation again and again see Ramakrishna is giving that hint unless and until the mind is pure people won't be able to understand that when he is giving this hint and he says when God becomes man he is exactly like man he has the same hunger thirst disease grief and sometimes even fear Rama was stricken with grief for Sita Krishna carry on his head the shoes of his father nanda so how the god is behaving when they are taking the human form but human when he is really unselfish longing for God then only can understand this purity then only can take the benefit of this that is what the Ramakrishna giving the hint in the theatre when an actor comes on the stage in the role of the holy man he behaves like one and not not like the actor who is taking the part of the King he plays his own role this is another example and then he is telling one and impersonator ba who rupee in those days the there was very less items for entertainment the one was very famous one day for people they still dressed themselves in different forms and they still come to the people and people is to enjoy that the Baku rupee impersonate her dressed himself as a world-renowned Singh monk pleased with his correctness of his disguise some rich people offered him a rupee he did not accept the money but went away shaking his aide afterwards he removed his disguise and appeared in his usual dress then he said to the rich people please give me the rupee they replied why you ain't a very fusing our present why do you ask for it now the man said but then I was the I was in the role of your holy man I cannot accept money likewise when God becomes man he behaves like man the another indirect way he is giving the monks he should be AB like a monk the moment you have taken up disgrace whether you have become perfectly holy or not you should be constantly aware that you were wearing a dress that the holy man your behavior should be accordingly so that way is also giving and that is the reason one should wear the when they become monk a different type of dress to wear why to remind himself I am a monk and I have to behave like this I cannot behave like that there are some norms there's more many people they do not understand because that is the idea we go in this way and you should not feel the attraction for the world things at Brindavan one sees many places associated with Krishna's life now he is changing there that discussion and he is telling about the Brindavan is such a holy place but the people many people they do not understand the importance of that place when a person is going over there or leaving over there if they only remember what happened over there and that is the pilgrimage when you go to a holy place a pilgrimage place what actually we should do is remembering the things that happened over there see Ramakrishna again indirectly teaching of that at Brindavan one sees many places associated with the Krishna's life Sri Indra we were there during the holidays he was a rich man from Calcutta they wish to go and visit those places so Surendra went over there visitors were continually pestered from money when you were going over there in the Brindavan so many holy people are leaving over there and moreover in those days and even today some old people they go and they stay over there Boniface peace because after the retirement when they they have their family don't want them they usually go to Kashi urban Davao these are the two places and they are naturally just for the survival we were up visiting there he asked for some help money the priest and others asked for it continuously we told them that we were going to leave for Calcutta the next day but we fled from brindaban that very night Surendra he was a rich man and he came to see Ramakrishna and he was revolting or tea and then he was thinking that very in a smart way he has handled that problem people were asking for money and I did in this way I told tomorrow we will go that is still time is there but in that night itself we came away so we need not to give that master what is that shame master didn't say ramakrishna didn't admitted to tell it but you know this is the man who is to help so much pasta ramakrishna he never hesitated thinking that who if i say this type of harsh word to him may be that you will stop donating me what will happen to me we never bother about that why because it loved him and that is the way a religious a spiritual person should try to guide we will comes near him without hesitation to tell them the truth for their betterment for their guidance what is that that you played like that you could give some money or you could say I won't give instead you behaved like that shame you said you'd leave the place the next day and ran away the very date what a shame you went over there that is the holy place and you are telling lies standing over there and cheating the people who give little health to survive that is what they say then one time when our country became free if after the 1947 the economical condition was not very good and the government was trying to use the maximum resources in the society the ramakrishna mission offered as because Rami Vivekananda he said education you have to give education the ramakrishna mission was developing the schools because educated monks were there and under their guidance is schools were coming up the government helped giving little money and some fifty percent not the 35 percent salary for the teachers and the staff they took the health belongs to run the institution properly and the more better way so the there was a as the governor of this place the Chief Minister was there and he said give the swami in ramakrishna mission Shamim to start a school of his officers there in those days ICS officers they were trained by the Britishers very intelligent people so they have kept everything in the budget and they have given that these are the things that should be given to them salary for the teachers and then for the construction reason that nothing for the monks but the chief minister he was not a Hindu he was a Brahmin and when he saw that he said what about the monks nothing has been given no provision for the Dame for the eating and they being there for their clothing their maintenance nothing has been given been the answer of those officers but the amongst way they need money look at it and that Chief Minister is a very famous Chief Minister dr. bill on Chenjerai he said are they going to out for begging for their food and then come back and help now tell me suppose you give an apartment to a government teacher a headmaster so you have to give him that complete this salary and of course all other things so much money you are spending for one teacher than other teachers and here the only need little money for their food and for the maintenances that also you don't like to give this is called judgment with the monks are over there they are living very meager living only little food in exchange they are giving the high moral value to the society their lives their teachings that is giving constant consciousness to the society what wrong to help them a little that is what they say strong and here also see Ramakrishna scaling the shame you could should not do Sri in the embarrassed here and there we saw the babaji's the Vaishnava things are called as babaji's and the pedantic sense of called Swamiji so these bodies in the woods practicing spiritual discipline in solitude that also he noticed now he is remembering that now he is telling some Christians to love shrenger very much and that's why immediately just the affectionate father he is guiding him he should not have done like is master did you give them anything you saw them they are practicing in the solitude surrender no sad rich people they love their money so much so they don't like to give it to anyone you like to always have that for their own then the Saddam Oh Krishna is telling that was not proper of you one should give something to mom and devotees devotees here it means who have left their heart and home and completely depending on God but they have not taken the dead were other clothings that not taken the sannyas of house but they are depending completely on God you should help them one should give something to wrongs and devotees those who have the means should help such persons when they meet them mushara domine baby in our excellent way she told in Bengali jar our child shimamu jar 9c Chavo suppose you can help then you please give because by giving by helping a religious person you are also getting the benefit of that and suppose you don't have the means to help then go on taking the name of God so that way both will be benefited I'm going to bring the bond with mother Babu the moment I came to the true book heart the struggle God is the bathing place in the Jamuna where according to the tradition Vasudeva the father of Krishna crossed the river carrying the newborn child through a stormy night that's called Google that is caught the river in a flash I saw the bottom crossing the Jamuna with Krishna in his arms it's not imagination is realization he saw immediately see Ramakrishna in many places he went to see that particular god or goddess but then he told no it is not the place like when he went to the birthplace of chaitanya mahaprabhu then some of the people they said this is the place it will no it cannot be which is I am NOT getting the feeling that is a beautiful way in Brindavan and mathura thus tradition says that the disciples of Jatin about Prabhu they discovered this places it was completely covered in jungle and in the northern part of India the yupi the jungle means we're very difficult to the interview according hubs are there these two go over there with great difficulty meditate over here get the vision of that particular place what are the things that happened over there according to the scripture these two tally and this to declare this is the place that happened over here there is a wonderful way of understanding thing discovering things it is a spiritual way the cinema Krishna told one evening I was taking a stroll on the beach of the river there were small patches hearts on the beach and big palm trees it was the cow dust both holy in the Indian language they call it gold who leaked out dust why go to leave duly means the dust go means the cow hundreds of cows when these two come back to the villages after grazing and outside and naturally from their hooves lot of dust is to go up from distance people could see that it is completely making dirt and that was the evening almost the evening was approaching - the name was go duly it has the translated over here cow just our the cows were returning from the purse to raising dust with their hooves I saw them folding the river then came somehow hard boys crossing the river with their cows no sooner did I behold this scene then I cried out o Krishna where are you and became unconscious when Saddam o Krishna the people is to some they were there all the time this to be very very cautious to the care of him now and when he is to go into the Samadhi so naturally the body somebody had to stand over there to take care I wanted to visit Shah Mukunda and Radha Kunda kunda means the pond and name was Shama and Radha they say that Shama means the Krishna he been in that and the rasa in another place so module Babu sent me there in a palanquin we had a long way to go food was put in the palanquin while going over the middle I was overpowered with emotion and wept o Krishna I find everything the same only you are not here this is the very meadow where you take tended the cows credo followed me on foot I was bathed in tears I couldn't ask the bearers to stop the palanquin at sha Mukunda and radha kunda i saw the holy main living in small mug hearts facing away from the road this day their eyes should fall on the main they were engaged in spiritual discipline one should visit the 12 groves these are the places in Banda vana and when one goes to a holy place one should remember it without talking in anything else must go on reading and remembering and praying that is the way one should go for a pilgrimage recently I went to Thousand Island Park you know the very famous place particularly those who are the followers of Shama Vivekananda they know the importance of Thousand Island Park there the manifestation of pedantic knowledge and the personality of Swami Vivekananda manifested so much over there in the Thousand Island Park still with houses there that area is there each and everything and this is the beauty of the America they never change anything though they modify in such a way all modern amenities aware but at the same time the moment you reach over there you can feel this is the shop we began on the visited this is the place this is the way become the game everything as it is but very nicely in a modern way of of equipment the whole village maintained in that way then how those villages over there they honored him everything is there we went to that particular house a lady gave that house to show me the vacant the sheen budget first and from all over the America different group at 12 or 13 I think twelve of them they went over there a small house you cannot leave there more than one or two people can leave others ways to leave here and there and they were camping outside also but every time this to go and this to seek ways to meditate just to listen to show me gee the very small room the living room most of the time ecology is to stand up and pacing up and down is to talk inspired talks that is the book and so fortunate the some of the people they know Toodee down and it has come now published in the book form so when a group of young devotees there are volunteers I told them I'd like to go over there they also join me and he found out all the paths how to go and where to stop and one devotee was there in New York he received as over there and he was driving his own car all of us could be there I think seven or eight of us all the way we were chanting reading meditating and afterwards when he came to that particular building we sat over there we felt as if we are in the presence of Shama T feeling then he went inside the jungle where Swami ji is to go with one or two devotee spiritual instruction for them because all are different the minds are different so instruction are different some it is to take them completely still that small block of their stone is there the swami used to sit on that and the devotees to sit on the other used to talk and then he lives to come back to steal that road so it is not me I have to be careful you have to go steal all those things out there that was a wonderful experience at least I had over there when I came back I was remembering and those places are still there which is believing the devotees should take the benefit of visiting those places I don't know but maybe there are reasons so they don't keep it open all the time only for a few days and that too as I told people are not allowed to stay there I was also not staying there I was living with the other devotees in a hotel nearby water not much distance agree of the car but main thing is going on remembering one should I went into Samadhi at the size of the image of Banco Bihari sodunke Bihari there's another name of Shri Krishna the famous temple is there in that state I wanted to touch it I did not want to visit Govinda jail twice at Mathura I dreamt of Krishna as the cowherd boy and very interestingly she died and mater had also the same dream the hill guy was physically serving see ramakrishna and motto the rich man he was providing all other things for his up and maintenance and all so both of them were blessed by Shri Ramakrishna so they also saw Krishna in their dreams and here it says that in Shri Indra you have both now he is talking to surrender you had both yoga and Baba Yoga means the detachment boga the attachment you are having the board then immediately he was telling there are different classes of sages one is Gramercy Brahma rishi brahmer she and the table she beaver and Rishi and Roger she Raja the king and the Rishi then his immediately is mentioned sukadeva is an example of the Brahma she completely constantly meditating on the Brahman living under Amin so he has no other thing no body consciousness even the sugar diva so he is known as the Brahm marshy Brahma Rishi now he didn't keep even a book with him there sukadeva an example of the de Bercy is not other not other was a God divine at the same time Rishi and he was also thoughtful he was thinking and his life was completely different he was with the kid gods again is to come to the world people to help them to guide them to inspire them so that way and Jonica was the king and he was the father of schita this Janaka was a Rajah she was the king at the same time completely detached that is called Janaka the rishi devoted to service work work selfless work that is called the devotee of the divine mother attains the term and the moksha he enjoys artha and kama as well and see ramakrishna is telling if you want anything all the food you can get if you become a devotee once I saw you in the vision he is talking to the surrender I saw you in the vision as the child of the divine mother why we used to laughs remember so much not because he was a rich man not because he is to help him peace is the point that we have to know the truly religious person never care about the worldly thing who is going to help him so I should be careful dealing with him not like that behavior equal to everyone and at the same time these type of personalities like Saddam Oh Krishna who could see the past present and the future he was the issuer so obviously he saw this our devotee and he said I saw you in a vision the child he was the child of the Divine Mother and you have both yoga and yoga otherwise your confidence would look dry he is mentioning but it is not good to have much money why he is mentioning ever I find that joy do Malik did them only goes another and travel of the reach but used to go just ramakrishna is to go to him also talk to him to do more to almost like a framed way is to talk like the ramakrishna cinema krishna once visited german league and he saw so many people are coming and you do he is asking what is the rate now about the rise what is the rate now about the plot of land and these and that is as the business people they did is to do Sudama krishna was sitting and watching and he could understand that he is simply asking it not that he will purchase the people are bringing the gold people are bringing the clothings people are bringing many things he is bargaining with am talking with them asking for the rates but he is sure that he would own purchase some krishna realized it and said why you were doing like that then you do only good this is the way a rich man should behave otherwise how people will come to him all these people would come and weakening desire that i can sell the things to a rich man so the flow of people on the outside will be other people they observe my god so many people are going and selling their things to this which man to that way in the society i would be so this is the way that people always do one day i rank to a very famous man he was in Calcutta High Court as a judge I told I want you to come and speak on such-and-such program can you please come and he said oh give me some time I have to see my diving whether I am engaged or not then after some time he rang back and told Tommy gee I should not be able of it that way with you you know most of the pages of blank I am not engaged at all but the moment you get the invitation if you say yes you natural people and then go they don't have any engage mean that means he is not that we shot by others so you have to tell I'm busy I cannot come at you okay change your date and let me Jane so this is the way 1d way it goes so out of just that practice I told you then I realize that you are a monk I should not talking that way to you I am sorry I am open please tell me when I have to go so this is the way the world goes the jessamine link was also behaving like that but see Ramakrishna is tailing the one should not have too much of money because they become like that unnecessarily knowing new he another person to has both yoga and yoga I saw him and his son leaving the band before the image of divine mother at the time of Durga Puja though they were in a humble way they were doing that but they had the proudness we are worshipping Durga shrilled are now asking this question said why can't I meditate now as a surrender is asking and Sagami krishna's answer is very simple this is for him you know the mind as we have already studied the Yoga Sutras we know the mind is sometimes catered in Sanskrit disease Shiva when it is dark and Mura it can't think about anything so that is the moral condition then it is gathered is called big shift B means negative shift shift remain scattered not scattered so gather it then a kagra one pointed then finally Malou the concentrated that is the different stages of the same mind majority of the people they go by the scattered or molar dot darkened so that is the reason here's when the surrender is asking like that why it is again just to mention like that baggie Stan shamsher promise Olesya obesity brown possession a lobster Munakata on Abbas speak to Arnie in the yoga Sutra it gives this nine different reason why mind behaves like that the first and foremost is if you are think physically also when we are sick we cannot concentrate the mind and mental sickness terrible so that is the wave stana also mental tiredness sometimes we become very tired when we are practicing meditation we become tired mentally that is the time one should sing the devotional songs or go in the company of other devotees applica chitchat so that we also some share is a doubt so naturally mind will never be concentrated dramas are the desire for enjoyment and ownership it is physical tiredness ability desired non-stop desire for enjoyment or be dirty visit even stop oh- no stop constant one of them that I need this I need this I need this some of the in early ladies I have seen one after another I have visited these are the places then I am going over there then I am going by so much no no no sorry I'm getting the opportunity I am going and these are the holy places I must visit and it actually you have visited all those places now concentrate we went one place that is the way you have to develop so they don't understand that why because the mind condition is like this and they are thinking they are using the time properly by visiting holy places recently if we people came the lady scheme all the way from India spending so much of money why I have to go to all the barranco societies all the places Swami Vivekananda visited and she is carrying some of the books written by the system the gargy and the research work these are the places I have to visit actually in India also so many places somebody visited have you visited those places but these are the way we are unnecessarily camouflaging and cheating our own mind time is short so we have to concentrate developed meditation prayer reading so this is the ability go on and on and on when you are going to stop then brandy Dirr tional is a wrong understanding wrong prescription and then all of the vomica to our that is more more higher stage also when I am trying to reach to that condition but again falling down I can't reach then mind becomes restless and after anibus Victoire after realizing that particular stage I cannot continue that is also create the mental the Chanchala that is all this type of scattered things shirring the way Nisei said why can't they meditate cinema krishna so compassionate he understood immediately right this moment traditional way to ask him to concentrate is of no use so he is telling you remember God and think of him don't you surrender is telling yes sir I go to sleep ripping repeating the word mother master that is very good it will be announced if you remember God and think of him this is the simplest way so he is giving this instruction to shrenger ramakrishna taking the responsibility of shooting them why should shouldn't worry about anything master much recommend you have come to this such a guru and you have given everything to your God the Living God see Ramakrishna why you are ruling the swindler is he was actually the his early life
