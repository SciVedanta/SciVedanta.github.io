[229: Panchama Veda 229 : Sri Ramakrishna and Vedanta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gajiglaxes4)

being there devotees dear friends let us begin our the weekly study of the Pachuca veda the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna Tabaka Tom rhythm topped achieve annum Kobe be rewritten Calma shop 'him subhana Mangalam srimad artem booby green aunty a buried Arjun aha this the way Bhagwan Sri Ramakrishna he is expressing the different different facets of the spiritual life it is really wonderful and those who were sincere those who want to realize God there are too many other things are also there like good people there are good people they don't cheat others they are not stealing they're good people and there are people who are also practicing different spiritual things disciplines morality all those there also another but the third category they are very sincere to realize God very sincere to realize God in this very life of course they are very rare very few as in the bhagavad-gita it says Manu Xian arm Sahasra issue Castilla to teach entry yet the time opposite Dianna question mom Betty tatata of the millions and millions of people only handful they truly strive to realize God among those small group only a few will be able to realize God so naturally that sincerity everyone see Ramakrishna and the law first class who you were studying he said but for those who lead householders life and those who identified themselves with the body this attitude of I am he is not good so you can remember those who are attending this class regularly the ceramic Isner the to show mr. sannyasi was visiting him at dictionary in his room and dave practice by Dante Sousa Ramakrishna took up that the Vedantic discourse and he was asking or do me think about it etc then he said this the badonk means I am he he means God I am God so this is an attitude this is a goal I want to know myself and so by the process of knowing the ultimate result I find that I am God so when you hear this when you listen to this we it gives us a shake is it possible I am God so that is a different kind but it is true and it can be proved you know very you know the Barrentine they always give the arguments and the proofs also but this is not for ordinary people the people in the world people having the desire it is nothing wrong I am having the desire to earn these to do these nothing wrong but only thing we should have to remember when see Ramakrishna is telling the for the house under sly and those who are identified themselves with the body body means eye and mind so this eye and mind the name and form those who are having this identification very strong for the this path is not correct that is what salam o krishna is telling it is not good for the householders to read bid anta or the yoga vasishta when he means that when he says the read why because if you're sincere so obviously you have to understand I am NOT very good in mathematics suppose I'm not good in mathematics now I am not supposed to study the science the science means you need the engineering you need mathematics here is a base so obviously oh this is not mine this subject okay no problem I can learn something else the those who are studying yoga vasishta or the B dontoh means what here C Ramakrishna is not telling that if you just study for the just for knowledge I like to know it academic knowledge no problem if you like to know what is there in the yoga vasishta the conversation between sri ramachandra and his guru no problem just for academic knowledge I can read it but that subject if I am taking as my Scripture as my Veda for the self-realization and I am attached to the body that will be a wrong choice that is exactly what salam o krishna stilly why I am taking so much of time to explain this this is very very essential otherwise people make always the wrong choice so that is the thing frames I will read from some of the yoga vasishta as Raghavan C Ramakrishna said and in the yoga vasishta itself if the gibberish to chapter 1 verse 3 it says ah hum but the be mocked us geometry yes Justine is chay-ara now at M Tamaki noted young Sirach means Shastri a de carb√≥n who is qualified yoga Vasishta a well-known text of the vedanta is deeply philosophical and rational in his approach to truth it says this who is qualified he only is qualified to read this book Rittman means he's taking this particular Scripture as a guide to his realization self-realization he only is qualified to read this book of pedantic knowledge who has the who as a result I am bound I want to be liberated that this is the important decision I like to be liberated I just like to read this book to know what it contains no problem but when I take this book as my guide book for the self-realization then it is I am bound I want to be liberated and who is neither ignorant not the knower of the truth ignorant means no basic at all neither ignorant means the one who is not at all having any basis of the pedantic knowledge it is not for him I am God or I am the self if you tell to some child then what will happen he won't understand anything of it but if you say this is Krishna and Krishna is playing with his frames and Krishna is also eating Krishna is sleeping Krishna is making so that is the beautiful way the child will slowly grow into spirituality and then slowly he will understand so the state bass tape this is the growth be danta means Upanishad the knowledge that take the aspirant beyond the ignorin subdue allottee and that is the bear anta who is qualified to study Balanta and here again adi shankaracharya he is mentioning the who is qualified to study again we have to remember study means who is taking this particular Scripture as a guide book for his spiritual success made hobby perusal withdrawn whoo-ha a poor oksana owed acharya art nodded daya Gupta luck Sharna luck Sita made hobby Purusha withdrawn so that is he says it must be made avi very intelligent otherwise it is very difficult to understand within this body the self is there because the the way you have to analyze it that is my god I should cook some food for God I should go and cry before God I should pray is that we easy but when you say there is no God you cannot depend on anyone you are the god so obviously that person should have high qualification should not have any desire in his mind should understand that this body and this world completely illusion I have nothing to do with it then only he is qualified to follow the path of Balanta that is exactly what vagabonds the Ramakrishna is telling and here also we find made are be perusal with Duan whoo-ha poha beach oksana is very good in debating why debating because so many people come and tell against and if you don't understand and if you don't know how to refute you'll be carried away by those so ideas so obviously one should be very very qualified in debating so you have said this so let me take up on this way that is the debate I am NOT this body I am NOT this mind the how can you say that you are a body you are in mind how can you say that you are not the body the right this moment I know I am this body but in reality I am NOT the body so you have some arguments you know how to understand that body is changing anything that is changing is to be destroyed but my goal is to become permanent and what is that permanent see so that slowly you have to argue you should know about the basic Balanta and some practices of it and if you have the desire to become famous become reach become known to me naturally this is not for you the Vedanta is completely different if the people are not clapping then people are not following me then I am dejected then you are not a bit antic student because you have to understand this world has nothing to do with you Shankar Acharya is travelling he is establishing the Vedanta but you knew it very well that this is a temporary but temporary in what sense this world is not that tomorrow it is going to be destroyed no it will continue for a long long long period of time but still it is temporary we have discussed this many times now here Shankar Acharya stealing ad Acharya art knowbut daya he is qualified to realize art man Ahmed daya so these are the lucky lucky ana these are the qualities qualification Raghavan Salem kishna said their householder should not study why but they have the responsibilities they have the families children that they have to keep the money in the bank they have to have the property they have many planning's that you only they have to go and when you think that oh I am NOT the body at all why should you care for all this so this is the reason again in ceramic richness say that that those who are sincere see Ramakrishna whatever he said he said only to those who are really sincere to and trying to realize God for them only and then some of the sentences in some of the world some of the conversations are there he is telling for meaning I don't be dejected oh then why should I read the Gospel of Serrano Krishna because I am not that way qualified no not at all any moment those things may come the the Pragya it means we do not know what we have done in our past birth any moment it may open up the force of that power of that knowledge will come but we should read and understand and that ached in this way a ceramic is not as my personal God okay I should and I and ceramic Krishna are one it may be in sometime one of his direct disciple Swami charlatans and the G whom he praised so much he went to his master say Ramakrishna said I have a prayer but yes what is that he said please bless me so that I can see the art man in every being that is the path of knowledge the end of the path of knowledge the goal of the knowledge Salameh Krishna said oh that is the very long journey but then only you can understand that way but anyway I bless you you will have that those who have read the biography of Xiaomi sedan and the G do you know he really realized that Hartman in every being so in his behavior so that was proved Swami Vivekananda they another one turian energy so like this there are another group is there direct disciples of Salaam Krishna they never bother about that they told I like to be with God I like to see God I like to talk to God you know problem there are also monks they I like this so we should not confuse this thing and again in support of vagabonds the Ramakrishna statement that those who lead the householders life and those who identified themselves with the body this attitude I am he is not good we find in the Kotoko nation I am quoting from Shankar Acharya I am quoting from the yoga vasishta now the catawba nished it says nabhi de tu dis cherry tart Nishant nasa ma iturra now Shantou mana so VAR p pragya nina up north the one who has not withdrawn from bad conduct what is bad conduct anything attached to it this world worldly life and to achieve those things is a process that is adopting is not good there's the bad conduct lack saints control because of that only the bad conduct the Saints control we can't control his speech he uses film the languages are his thoughts are all the time polluted with very worldly very basic things whose mind has no concentration or is not together concentration means together whose mind is not concentration is concentrated at one point it can't do that cannot attain this self through knowledge cannot attain the self through knowledge I am repeating to make it very clear through knowledge we can attain he may attain God in some devotional way a path of karma path of yoga but all the discussion is going on the path of knowledge so I should not I should understand me I should read my own mind I should know these are the things that there I am not qualified so let me read the venetie let me know what is there in the other books of the Vedanta but my party's devotion all my path is unselfish karma work nothing wrong Adi Shankaracharya also in one of his commentary he said the knowledge of the self cannot arise for the one whose mind is under the hold of desire and aversion when he was giving the commentary on bhagavad-gita it was the chapter seven twenty seven verse he mentioned this so friends we come to this academic knowledge we should read taking up the path of knowledge for the self-realization my goal my end of my spiritual achievement we have to be careful if I am if I see the yes I don't have any attachment to this body to this worldly life I don't have anything to do with these worldly things I must take if you like you can do that the devotees in the room remain silent Wednesday Ramakrishna was talking like that so Krishna was smiling a picture of self-contentment he appeared happy in his own self the art Minh that is the joy and when you feel when you realize that you need not to go for anything else for the enjoyment for the joy for the Bliss exactly that they saw in the person of ceramic is 'no it was manifesting in his bottom person so here one shadow whispered to the other look this is the state of the paramahamsa this is the state of the paramahamsa we always called Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Parma means great and hamsa is a symbol of the brahmana he is that great the supreme Brahman the supreme Brahman it is only one doesn't need the help of anyone anything else to be happy now this discussion is going on those people though they came then the left then we will start from here again master at first he is telling to the other devotees particularly to mr. aim master master at first I was stark mad why am i list so now but I get into that state now and then mad means completely forgetting where I am for completely forgetting the body used to marched himself with the supreme joy the Brahman and he never wanted to come down from that state that supreme condition and sometimes some people after lot of practices spiritual practices self restrain then they reach over there and we the reach they cannot come down they don't like to come down there is a full of joy and the joy on comparison we cannot compare it anything else and naturally what happened they forget that they have a body which needs food needs the other things to sustain then slowly this s Bhagavan see Ramakrishna said after reaching to that the ordinary sod occurs the ordinary as parents they died after 21 days because the body is not at all concerned for them they forget about the existence of their own body but the sadhana Krishna and about others like him they come down why because they are their mission is completely different that the guy did the torchbearers did the light houses so obviously they had the mission to come down once again so can you imagine the tremendous mental capacity the mind goes into that realm which is one which is not - which is full of joy and then again is coming back to this body sense this world around so he was telling us to go as to become mad no I am NOT because the condition is more importance has been given for teaching than his own elevated conditioned aim the master Mercia who was always with him he said you don't have just one mood he is telling to see Ramakrishna you don't have just one mode as you said you experience various moods sometimes you are like a child sometimes like a madman sometimes like an inner thing and sometimes like a goal and now and then you are a natural person see the different moon in one song they have mentions ramakrishna ass and not tune manish a new person new human being it's so difficult to understand him and sometimes he is just like a young man young boy the making fun with others at talking in destroy and the next moment in the ultimate the realization of the brahman that mood changes it is very difficult and that is the reason Xiaomi Vivekananda mentioned after observing he said about our average tire he is the highest among all the incarnations why because he know about our no incarnation no manifestation of the God through human being we find so many varieties of moods Salam o Krishna them he said yes like a child but I also experienced the moods of a boy and the young man when I give instruction I feel like a young man then there is my boy sness at this boyishness the that me used to have the fun and all that and saddam orchestra is talking about he's so very beloved disciple not in what do you think of Noreen he's taking the report from the master ma che master ma she was the teacher at master obviously used to meet so many students so ceramic ISNA wanted to know from the master ma che what do you think about Noreen the master MA shame said he has good trait sir master ceramic is new yes the shell of the goal is good the pan pure made out of it will give good music he says to me you are everything Salameh krishna is appreciating because is very difficult to understand when a person in his life so he's eating he's sleeping is going here and there just like a normal person to understand that he is God is very difficult and young Noren hardly that time his age will be 18 19 or 20 even in that time is a young age he could understand ceramic is not the serum krishna is very happy and not him said you are everything that means you are God if I forbid Noreen to do anything he understands it very well that means he's a very good disciple when the guru is asking something to do a son not to do the disciple should obey Noreen was having his own personality and we know most of us we know Sharma Vivekananda the great personality his own discrimination but at the same time he immediately used to understand why see ramakrishna is asking these and he's to follow his words he who would renounce the world must practice all these disciplines what is the discipline obeying the words of the guru and the scripture he who would renounce the world must practice all these disciplines strain we have to understand sometimes some young people they come and say why should I have to obey you you means anyone in church the question is when a young man is coming why is coming to become a monk and what is this monk could monk are supposed to believe that there is only God and nothing else so naturally the main the problem to understand God is the ego so that is the reason the training is in such a way that your ego should be crashed ego should gravy then slowly become completely humble and when you become humble then you will be able to understand and that is the reason the instructions of the scriptures and the Guru because Guru has gone through that practices and following the scripture and now he is giving you those instructions you must do these people should do this and if you follow that then only it is possible and the processes breaking the ego and that is the reason that he said not in he always understand and he followed that he would renounce the world must practice all this discipline they are made for sannyasins they are made for sannyasins that these instructions are made for the sannyasins this is the discipline so that is the way one has to break his own ego the long and almost the beginning of the organization the ramakrishna mission a boy came and joined young man from calcutta his father was very famous and very rich so naturally he never liked it like a bigger he he is roaming around at the humble grace so why my son should be like this one day his father came from Calcutta to see what my son is doing and he saw his son is sitting and dressing the best tables with other bra Majoris other navier shoes then he said for these you have joined for dressing the vegetable I will give you cart load of his tables come back and if you like to dress the vegetable do that in a house why here his reply was the wonderful and he said father is not dressing the vegetable or cutting the vegetable any work through which I can satisfy the Divine Mother that is my goal is to make the Divine Mother happy whether by studying the scripture all by juicing the vegetable is the same to me that should be the monastic attitude and when it can come when there is no ego when there is no desire the people should appreciate me they should know me they should take my photo they should take my signature no not like that they cannot become a monk the monk is very humble whenever he is explaining the scripture he knows the scripture and when he's doing some ordinary job that time also he's very sincere he knows everything whatever we do my goal is to make the Divine Mother happy and the blessings of the Divine Mother so he this we find while practising shod and I man should be very very careful about the last and Luca master to him Noreen's mother said to him about me even we are enchanted by the sight of him he means this Ramakrishna not to speak of you a mere child that means the Norns mother nor his mother was educated lady and she was she was also having the great personality and he taught English to not in so in the beginning so these are the things he was not an ordinary lady johar judgment about cinema Krishna is days that we have we become enchanted the salam o krishna giving the hint that even the family the mother also liked him today I went to the village to see milk on toast theoretical performance it will given at Nobunaga's house noon Kanta in those days he was a very famous singer and the theatrical performance means mainly based on the life of Krishna so these two enact in the life of Krishna and they'll be narrating in this way and then the songs will be there that was the entertainment in those days but through that the people is to learn about the moralities high spiritual values and it was organised in the know be near his house the children there are very bad ceramic is mistily they have nothing to do but find for the wind he singing or doing these these young people they were finding faults the Amish don't never liked it so something is happening we must learn some moral values from that particular song or the drama but only finding fault that salam krishna didn't like friends those who were the followers of see ramakrishna must note it so when we are reading the gospel of t ramakrishna as the Pancham of veda it is also the knowledge and in almost in every line you will find is a teaching is there what is the teaching he is telling that if you are sincere and he have decided that my path for God realization of the self realization is the path of knowledge you should be having these qualities as we have already mentioned over here and then when you have decided that I am going to realize God you must follow your the words of your guru your preceptor and the scripture and the third don't find false whatever is happening take the good of it that is in almost every sentence assembly every lines will find the teachings and he says that the children are very bad they have nothing to do but find fault in such a place the person's spiritual feeling is restrained in such a place where the people are constantly talking negative criticizing so those the company of those people is better to and not to have the company why because your spiritual growth will be stopped then so that is the ceramic is nestling to him can you tell me why people feel so much attracted to displace meaning himself what does it mean so he's all the time we'll find again and again he's asking this type of question to him why he's the recorder he is noticing everything the if he is not having clear idea about ceramic isne and if he himself start thinking in a different way why the man is talking like this this moment he said these this moment he said these so ceramic isne made everything clear to more the master master master mouche time and again proved that he was in that is really not only devotee but very intelligent person can you tell me what does it mean why people feel much attracted to this this means Ramakrishna a few paragraph before theorem krishna said then one should be ready to give up everything and never ever think about the name and fame if he wants to become a sannyasi a renouncer a monk then he said some people are coming to me does it mean that I am saying something not practicing so he is making the thing clear can you tell me why people feel so much attracted to this place meaning himself what does it mean m-master Masha is telling it reminds me of an episode in Krishna's life at Brindavan it's from the bhagavata the tenth chapter of the bhagavata is the life of Krishna and the Krishna as a young boy he was playing with his frames and the grazing the cows the Brahma Brahma saw and he is this our master is this that lord vishnu in the form of shri krishna he was being so normal like a cowboy so naturally Brahma got confused and he was thinking to judge whether he's truly God he took away all the cows and Krishna was sleeping under a tree he got up and oh my god where all the cows and not only the cows are the friends also all the boys no one was around but it was time for the people that those children to come back it was evening dusk the Krishna the God himself in that form manifested all cows and all those boys and came back because he is the creator so he created another story says when they came back the cows started loving the the cobs and also the mother started loving the children so all become so much these Tula but that love that traction became many-fold why because it is the pure God who manifested that is the feeling there is the story the he said M said people are coming to you because that same attraction as the mothers of the cowherd boys they felt for Krishna and people are also attracted to you in that fashion then Ramakrishna giving the argument that is the attraction of God the truth is the divine mother creates the spill and it is that which attracts people divine mother creates the spill as a holy man and obviously people they get attracted and they like to talk to him they like to come to him they like to help him like to feed him why because the manifestation of the God and that proves that God is the source of love people cannot restrain themselves but to come to that particular person within whom death manifestation has come now see Rama Krishna is telling well not as many people come here as used to go to cash off shame so the so practical the keshavjee under shame used a great auditor the ceramic isne is telling so many people used to go to listen to him that many people didn't come to me and how many people respect and honor K shop he is known even in England Queen Victoria spoke with him it is said in the Gita that God's power is manifest in him who is honored and respected by meaning but so many people do not come here you see how he's asked trying to judge the in so many people going to cash up general Shan many of you those who are reading this book you know that he was a great scholar so obviously not only scholar is a very famous speaker the people always get attracted to those who can place those things and through the language through the words the very attractive way in India in the history of the world there are many great leaders who really were very good speakers orators so we in this to speak the people whose commitment mesmerised the key ship was one of such the people is to go to him to listen to him the Serrano Krishnan is telling C's or how many people you said the God manifestation so obviously people are attracted now why people are going to Kesha of course he must have also developed the that manifestation of God is there they didn't come to me that many number didn't come to me does it mean that I am not having that manifestation of God this is the question very tricky question the ketchup is drawing so many people but I have a bond see Ramakrishna the God Himself could not why master Masha is salute to master ma che see how he is tilling it was the householders who way into ketchup Shan householders means those who only you know that they are going to ketchup generation case of generation is very famous if you somehow could go to him can get some acquaintance with him then in the society I will also make myself somebody so that this is the householder tin tendency not religion not true spirituality but with the social acceptance so the mass term as I mentioned householders yes that is true the worldly-minded must emerge she used the word householders but ceramic isne changed the word he said worldly minded why boy worldly minded because if someone is very famous if i can somehow go and make a con connection with him busking in the reflected glory as they say i am all the time busking in that reflected glory I know Keyshia I talked to him I troubled with him and then that that way he is having some influence in the society that much so Serrano Krishna never wanted those type of people so he is maintaining will what Kesha has found remain a long time aim is now asking to the master the he keshavjee under chain found it not Ovid on the another branch of the Brahmo Samaj so will it be the perpetual it will continue master why he has written a Samhita a book of the rule for the guidance of the members of the Brahmo Samaj him but it is quite different with the work done by divine incarnation himself chitinous work for instance masters ramakrishna yes yes that is true him you yourself tell us that Jatin they've said the seeds I have shown will certainly bear fruit some time or other incarnation and speaker hell and heaven difference there great difference those who are great speakers but temporary they cannot remain for a long time but the people who may not be good speakers but whatever teaching they gave on the basis of their own realization practicing the truth that is completely different so here he says Jatin not even realized soul and not only that he was an Avatara too and he whatever he said obviously it will continue for long long time who knows ketchup generation now very few those who are very closed that Brahmo Samaj and those who are reading the gospel of ceramic is not the biography of the ramakrishna come to know about keshavjee understand who else but chaitanya mahaprabhu half of the world is buying now bowing down chaitanya mahaprabhu the great sage great saint so this is the difference in is telling master many people go to the semaj founded by Shiva not and his friend isn't it so M yes sir people of that short master smiling so another Shiva not he was also in the group then he made his own fraction he also started one so some people are also following him so like this only is there two clubs even the some people will start a club and some programme are going on then someone over there is not satisfied with the authority who will break some of his brains they will start another risen spirituality is not like that it's completely different the person who is stablishing never bother about that but the sincere followers did take his path and that becomes a trill part for the God realization so this is what Ramakrishna is telling Master smiling yes is the worldly-minded go there but not many of those who long for God and a trying to renounce last and Luca the famous speakers are raters so many came and particularly those who can as a religion the people are automatically attracted and those who can express that that religion in a very beautiful way so naturally people go over there but the thing we have to understand why I am going there are two things one is entertainment and other is enlightenment for the entertainment because he speaks the beautiful way and sometimes cutting jokes and sometimes pawning the words and then Angela presentation is a very good presentation some of the people they call is a package a good enjoy but is it really helping you to grow in your spiritual life are you sincere in that are you getting help from that teachings speeches this is only those who are truly trying to realize God the sincere devotees that's where is Ramakrishna again and again mentioning this word worldly-minded they only like that type of famous people to get associated with that and to Brok though i know him i talked to him he came and stayed with me that all this thing so this is not important friends see Ramakrishna is teaching is don't waste time for those things if you like to just to know just to enjoy the talk enjoy the lecture no problem but time is very short human life we do not know when the end will come so we have to be very very sincere we don't have much time left maybe some young 20 years old maybe 40 years maybe 60 it doesn't matter we do not know he is going to die at what age the human birth we have God desire to realize God also has come opportunity is there to realize God so why not why should you with time so this sincerely we have to study we have to practice and then in this very life we should realize God and that is exactly what Raghavan C Ramakrishna is teaching in it will be fine if a current flows from this place master Mercia is telling to see Ramakrishna it will be fine if a current flows from displacements from Salam o Krishna everything will be carried away by its force because ceramic is nice realization and ceramic is nice way of teaching so everything will be carried away nothing that comes out of the place will be monotonous and moreover it will be for everyone those who like to follow the path of knowledge or path of karma or Parata bhakti a part of Diana no monotonous neighbor and there are every aspect Sudhir so all will be carried and that hasn't really happened and that is exactly what happened true Shammi Vivekananda see Rama Krishna entered into Swami Vivekananda and that what sir master MA she was praying to see Ramakrishna wishing that has happened now the master smiling I keep mains own ideals intact those were following the ideology of Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna particularly we the monks and the Brahma cheiron's and the nonce and the very close devotees we must very carefully listen to these I keep Maine's own ideals intact I ask a bush neighbor to home to his bush neighbor attitude and a shakhter to his this is serum krishna he never say is that give away all paths and only follow me neighbor he's so broad so that is ceramic rish 'no sometimes some people this is this the cart no it's a philosophy it is not a cart cult people will only say this is the only right attitude only follow these and don't follow anything else don't follow this will say but no see ramakrishna and his followers will never say that cannot say that ceramic is never the ideal he said I asked Abby Schnabel to home to his bush never attitude and the shakhter to his but this is also I say to them never feel that your path alone is right and that the parts of others are wrong and full of errors Hindus muscle man's and the Christians are going to the same destination by different paths so that is why he is the the culmination of all faiths the ceramic isne is the home of harmony all different thoughts different paths different philosophy different modes all are coming and mingling in to see Ramakrishna so this is the cinema Krishna the Christians Muslims Hindus all are going to the same destination by different paths a man can realize God by following his own path if his prayer is sincere the DC the teaching of Slava Krishna no narrowness no narrowness but people should not make the mistake to understand this broadness someone came and told you people are teaching like this what didn't you become a Christian I too got for weight I am born Hindu I love this in the path I feel that this is the way I can realize God I am following but I am not criticizing others rather as best as possible I am trying to encouraging them helping them entering brothers friends let us go you go in your own path let me go in my own let us go and reach to the god that is the goal why should he fight with the path we have to reach to the goal so sinhala krishna is telling I am not changing anything Swami Vivekananda also afterwards he said in his famous lecture that all paths are leading to the same goal so this is see Ramakrishna BJ's mother-in-law said to me BJ another he afterwards he became a bush naba but he was one time one of the leaders of the Brahmo Samaj his mother she said we're going to tell Balarama Balarama the disciple of sri ramakrishna he that he was the main person he was a gem endure a landlord he's to helps Rama Krishna and his disciples a lot even after ceramic richness demise Balarama that it is unnecessary to worship God with form dad it will be enough if he prays to the formless satchitananda as because this Brahmo Samaj this too so there his mother BG his mother was also telling his why don't you tell Balarama Playa Salaam o Krishna why should I say such thing and why should he listen to me even if I say this is the thing mother BJ's mother she is practicing okay but know why he should not become this conversion to make the group that is very wrong one is coming out of his own okay you are welcome but unnecessarily when some time people are economically weak educationally weak or they're in great need then I can help you if you get converted into my faith this is a same conversion in that too is a scene you tell your philosophy you say frames I am following this philosophy and I am satisfied and if you like to follow me like to come to me okay I can also be with you as your guide and friend nothing wrong if the people are following you but unnecessarily you are thinking that I must have to have the big number and converting people those who don't want that is seen the conversion no it is not rather we should have to not the change conversion means I am imposing my idea on somebody no it's they they should understand the right thing the god is the only goal of human soul and they should choose their own path and philosophy and let them go so that is exactly what Raghavan see Ramakrishna said so friends we should stop over here and we should remember as vagabonds Ramakrishna is telling there may be great orators but if the and the orator means as the bhagavad-gita said the power of God is manifesting that is true but we have to see whether he can guide me to my goal and what is that goal god-realization this is one thing second to realize God the Hindus they always say there are four paths but the path of knowledge is very very difficult if we have any desire we should not choose that path and we should not think oh we had deprived where's the best part not like that best good is nothing like that any path I follow suit me and I should reach to God or the Hartman true devotion also one can just to the Brahman the artment again and again it has been saved in the Bhagavata also there are karma the karma through the path of karma also one can do and also there are some people who are having some doubts now the this problem all over the world and there are people who need services and we cannot physically go the doctors nurses they are doing it but shall we also go and help them you can but with proper care and if you really know how to help them otherwise just a number of people they go and they create problem no that is not the shaba and you can do the saber by sending some materials and by praying also so this is what see ramakrishna is telling any path can lead and lastly finally state all paths are leading to the same goal and ceramic is not believe it ceramic is not help them Salaam Krishna blessed them those who are followers of ceramic esna should also do the same thing - let us conclude with this stotra by offering our
