[53: Panchama Veda 53: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee1ccDfn7bQ)

so let us begin foreign a in our last class on we were discussing that 19th we were discussing that bhagavan sram krishna is visiting some of the devotees house and he was a very close one and salaam krishna used to like him love him so one thing we can understand we can observe the pattern how he spreading his message not through any newspaper or any article and in those days there was no tv radio no media the god himself is going to those people's house those places where he can get some other people also so that is the wonderful system he developed before him it was almost absent but sirama krishna he is going to the ordinary householder's house previously we have seen that the bhagavan buddha he is going to different places shankaracharya he is also visiting some of the places different places inviting the alarmnet people discussing with them debating with them and then spreading his message here sirama krishna he is going to only ordinary people very ordinary people and then he is talking with them this is very very important and this time takur has come for them only and particularly for the ordinary people the householders so he is visiting different houses and whenever he is going he is not only talking or visiting or meeting only those people of that house no he is encouraging him to invite many other people so nearby people and the neighbors they are coming friends are coming relatives are coming and takur is talking with them this time he is in shurendra's house and he is talking with his brother you are a judge that is very good but remember everything happens through god's power look at it even if we go on reading hundreds of scriptures uponeshas vedas will you get this straight direct teaching this is the specialty of sirama krishna you are a very special person you are in the society you are successful person but remember that everything happens through god's power this is a wonderful teaching the moment we can remember that then what happens the particularly two people they suffer one very successful successful people and they think that i am successful that's superiority complex oh these other people i don't like to talk to them i like this i don't like to mix with them i don't like to sit with them so that way they try to survive and slowly slowly they are going inside the cocoon and through this ego only they are destroying all their good deeds we do not understand this this is not affecting immediately this is we cannot see this so this is the difficulty the person is a good person maybe he is donating maybe he is visiting the pilgrimage pilgrim centers but because of his ego he is ignoring others criticizing others looking down upon others and by that way he's reducing all his good deeds and going back to the very wrong place so that's why sirama krishna is reminding and we sudama krishna god himself when we read the gospel of sirama krishna this is the specialty one should read with very very careful mind and you will hear him again and again sadhu-sanga sadhu-sanga so many people thousands of people hundreds of people they will be going to the temples churches and they are doing so many other good things also they are fasting for months together practicing so many other things but unfortunately not listening to those words which are really beneficial for spiritual development they memorized so many slokas they can chant the whole gita they can chant from the bhagavata from the punishers line after line but only thing that is very simple thing that they forget to get learn here that is ego that one should be free from ego and how to be free from ego he is telling over here he who has given you high position that is how you be became a judge he's talking with the judge he the god has given you this eye position and that is the reason you have become a judge very simple but the person can never believe it i am doing i am doing only this much only this much in the beginning this ego the eye confidence the swamiji is telling develop the self-confidence i can do i can do when others can do i too can do but at the same time you have to go on repeating with the help of god because if the god is not giving i cannot do anything so here shiramakrishna is dealing the brahman devotee that shurendra he is mentioning he has heard but as if not giving much importance on that teaching this is also another thing so many people they go to the to listen to the sermons they will be attending but they don't pay much heed to that why they are not shadakas the shadoka his whole attention in such a way his mind develop in such a way whenever the word will come out that particular word which is beneficial immediately he will catch it so that is why this is the difference when a person when so many people students they are listening to the teacher and one or two only very intelligent students they can understand these are the sentences these are the paragraphs and these are the places of the topic of the subject we must pay attention so this is the specialty of the shisha the disciple the student the listeners so that's why when this bhagavan is telling if you read this paragraph sarama krishna is going on telling his reaction is not much he only listen to it he is going to another question immediately he is asking the brahma so much preaches the freedom of woman and abolition of the caste system what do you think about that so he is talking about the high spiritual thing now he is talking the asking question about the relatively social problems there was a time when slavery was a great problem and not only here in america not only in the europe not only in africa and almost every places even nowadays in india there are places where they'll be giving some money as a loan to a person in the villages remote places the people will not know and they are so illiterate and so very ordinary they do not know the whole world has changed just for the survival they will go to a person who is rich he will say okay take this money then he will go on telling that this is the interest that you are paying but originally you are not paying the original is going on accumulating only little bit of interest you are giving then who is going to pay back who is going to give like that so your son also should do your daughter also should work your wife also should work the whole family is going on working all through their life but the poor family the poor people they don't understand when they are going to be free from that depth they can never become free still it is there involved in society and how we are going to solve it there are so much of education still there are so many torture so many things are going on the society always rotate in this way one after another the problems crop up it goes on like this so that is one part and second is the development of your spirituality cerama krishna immediately answering see this men feel that way when they are just beginning to develop spiritual yearning the men are feeling that we have to fast make everything correct in the society there should not be anything wrong that way they are thinking but in the society always there is something you cannot solve but those people who are sensible people good people who can become a devotee who can realize god he thinks that i have to fast go and make whole society happy can you make the whole society happy hundreds of people are dying for an ideology and when that ideology is established then again thousands are tortured millions are tortured we see in the history it is always there in the society suramar krishna is telling if you are concentrating for the spiritual development concentrate on that this is very very important then he is telling understand god alone is the highest good the eternal substance and that all else is transitory this is very very important god alone is the eternal good the highest substance eternal substance the highest good god alone and everything that we see is nothing but the transitory nothing remains everything is changing everything is moving the how long we will go on thinking about that a little bit whatever possible water comes in the way that is sufficient i am going to solve all the problem impossible so that is the reason those who are really interested to develop the spiritual spirituality those who are really interested to realize god they are called moon mokshu mumuksu mumuksu means those who are having the desire for liberation the liberation the concept is not there in the mind the concept of god is not very clear and look at these people each and every one they're going on thinking that my religion is the best my god is the final and whatever where you are leading to this is the speciality of sram krsna's teaching then he was telling solving a social problem particularly prevailing in india you asked about the caste distinctions there is only one way to remove them and that is by love of god lovers of god have no caste the the last time also we were discussing and we know most of us that there was an incident that happened in the life of maha sharon devi and we should not forget that we are discussing about this uh this incident that occurred happened so many hundreds years before when the indian society was totally closed to society very very orthodox society narrowness was too much ignorance about the true religion was almost absent and that time mahashara damani devi a lady and that to a widow she is she has gone to bangalore and people have come to respect her some just by hearing that she is the guruma the mother guru of the spiritual mother of swami vivekananda he has a very famous personality so they all have come to listen to mother to see mother and there are many many incidents in bangalore there's they talk in a dialect in a language which is totally different and mother was not knowing anything of it and she was not able to speak in english also there was no lingar franca for her to communicate then how she was communicating this is interesting all people who are so satisfied when she's simply sitting there quiet and they're from bangalore mostly from bangalore that karnataki language that they speak mother can't they are also quiet mother also acquired but everybody is satisfied and that is called spiritual language the mother's thoughts the blessings the messages is reaching very clearly to their hearts and because of their devotion they have come majority of them with a great devotion and they are going on receiving that here what happened one person is to come he was a so-called low caste and he was he used to stand outside the temple mother's house was adjacent to the takur's shrine and naturally people were not allowed to go inside like that and particularly that man unthinkable because he was untouchable so he was not entering into the temple he was standing outside the temple mother could observe that he is regularly coming standing over there and could understand that there is something wrong then she came to know that because of this reason because of that he is belonging to a caste which is very low considered as a low cost and the local people will never appreciate that he is entering into the temple and how he solved the problem one day suddenly without any discussion she called that young man will you please come my son and distribute this prasad to all the devotees sitting over here that's all the devotees were so happy that they are going to get the prasada mother and that boy he forgot that he is a low-caste person he is not supposed to enter into the temple happily with joy he entered not only that he entered into that room where mother was staying to bring that plate full of sweets to distribute among the devotees and to enter into that room he had to pass through the sanctum sanctorium with that holy place nobody mind why they forgot and what the why they forgot because the devotees they are very happy to get the prasad that mother has touched and mother is giving and she is giving through that boy all the cast systems was removed sirama krishna is telling you see this system can be removed just by love of god god has created and naturally all the creation is nothing but his creation and we belong to the god all of us so that that is the way sirama is giving the teaching sir what do you think of your lord your theological society the brahma-samaj people is telling that you are singing the name of hari it is good but again that gentleman is a judge and he is keeping up his point he wants to get some answer so he is going on questioning sirama krishna first he said first he who was asking now what about these two things about the education of the women and the caste system secondly he is asking what do you think of theosophy that there was a very prominent society in those days that's called theosophical society their headquarters still there i think in either in madras or in bandichiri one missed annie basanth she was very famous in those days and madame bolovaski cardinal alkart madham balboski was from russia and cornell alkart from america he was the only american in india at that time we can say or and then any person the vasant was very famous they were practicing this theosophy this to believe that still the spiritually spiritually elevated souls are living in the himalaya in different caves and in the jungles in a very remote places and they have the capacity to travel physically from one place to another because of the yogic power and these great souls if they come they can solve your problem so not god they were actually concentrating and devoting for those souls who can solve the problems if they are called a meditated and prayed etc so that way and people started believing them so the souls are coming from himalayan suramar krishna couldn't appreciate this type of thoughts because this only a limited thought about god he is telling i have heard that man can acquire superhuman powers through it and perform miracles the superhuman power and miracles this has nothing to do with the religion the pure religion those who are really interested to know about religion they should not go up for this so what we are going to acquire by that this something very interesting but otherwise it is nothing now in the iphones everything is available but the villager he will be wondering how you can say this thing and that thing here the people before going out checking how will be the weather then fixing that i am going over there in the car itself so gps they are fixing that i am going over there and this is my home address asking the car to drive up to that and wonderfully someone constantly watching you and guiding you is it not miracles the moment you are mistaken that road you cannot take immediately they will be taking we are calculating you have made a mistake i am calculating and then say take turn left turn right turn and then then they will say you have reached your place here in america people who are habituated for them this is very very normal but if you go to the places where people have no idea they will simply wonder someone is talking so this is very very special so this way what do you think about the theosophy the master is telling i heard about the miracle then he's still telling i saw a man who had brought a ghost under his control the ghost is to procure various things for his master what shall i do with the superhuman power suppose a ghost is under your control you can do so many things but the master immediately is asking what i am going to do with the ghost he cannot bring the god for me he cannot bring peace for me desirelessness for me what i am going to do with that ghost this is the question of a devotee the moment is a desire within the mind immediately the person will jump on his feet oh my god do you think i can control a ghost and i can do all these things there will be no problem in my life i can know everything beforehand see all this desire cerama krishna is telling can one realize god through them if god is not realized then everything becomes false this is the line we have to understand are we genuinely interested to realize god then this is for you if not well there are many other options many other things and you can obviously can surely free to follow that then when those things will never give you satisfaction come back that is why sirama krishna is telling if anyone has called god with a very pure mind at least once he will surely come to me so some people will be simply quoting sirama krsna's name along with all others gandhi srirama krishna and this is a very great person no doubt but sudama krishna so this is the difference you have to understand why people can understand why they are writing because in their mind also this conception is totally absent about he's a good person he is thinking about others he is giving donation to others they cannot think beyond this and he can do miraculous things they cannot think beyond this that is the important thing that is the reason to understand sirama krishna means you have to lift yourself to a higher plane of spirituality and higher plane of spirituality means desirelessness and how the desire will go because i have only one desire god realization and if you have that god realization desire know it for sure god will protect you you will get everything which is some you are supposed to get from the society sure but we don't have the patience the swami vivekananda is telling unselfishness is more paying but we don't have the patience to practice it unselfishness is more pain look at our life we have become little unselfish not 100 unselfish because still i have eye consciousness so naturally i am not 100 percent unselfish but a little unselfishness that i have it has developed within me by the grace of god takur ma shamiji i'm getting everything so much of respect so much of love and so many other things which of my career of my place persons cannot think of much better people they are not receiving those things which i am receiving i am getting unselfishness is more pain but we don't have the patience to practice it the here cerama krishna is telling about that what philosophy what the people are coming and helping you and then the ghost controlling the ghost what he will do with all those things then he is telling bhakti is the only essential thing he has come to calcutta now it was about four o'clock in the afternoon november 1882. he is he has arrived in calcutta to attend annual festival of the brahma-samaj sinama krishna he was not a brahman but he used to go to the brahma-samaj any opportunity you will never miss he will go he will be there he will talk to them sometimes officially sometimes unofficially why because in those days those brahma-samajis were educated people most of them were western educated people and they were a little bit will of people in the society and they were trying in their own way to understand god spiritual life and that is the reason surama krishna is going so this time he is not going to the jungle to fight with the rakshasas the demons no he is not going to organize the army to fight as a krishna deal it was now this is not necessary what was necessary in this age to make the thinking capacity perfect if you can understand a philosophy perfectly properly if you can understand the subtleness of the spirituality properly not only that you will be happy yourself at the same time you can make the society totally change to a wonderful place like heaven and that is why this time to establish religion dharma's dharma starpana the god has come in the form of bhagavan's ramakrishna and how he is doing it not with the bow and arrow not with the sudarsana chakra he did the same god did one time when it was necessary but now through education and what is that education perfect knowledge what is that perfect knowledge desire free desire desire free desire what are the freeness from the desires from all these objects that we see in the world because it is all transitory because it is all moving out because it is all going to end sometime that is the things that we should understand and will be free from those desires only one desire that will be within our heart that is i like to know the truth and that is the wonderful thing that long long back in dupunishad also we find that when they are reaching up to that truth they are behaving in a very i want to face the truth i want to know the truth and i have come over here i don't want anything else that golden plate that is covering the face of the truth you remove it the golden face golden cover means so many other things in this world name fame and money everything position everything that is there before reaching to the truth you get all these things that is called temptation in the christian christianity is called temptation and bhagavan buddha in the buddhism they say tana the personality of that tanha tanna means desire is always there in every religion they say devil and the temptation the devil is the personality of those desires temptations of the worldly things transitory things temporary things that is called temptation it's called tanha and krishna in our vedic term this is trishna is the thirst desire to get all these things how we can be free from this here we find bhagavan sirama krishna is telling bhakti is the only essential thing one obtains love of god by constantly chanting his name and singing his glory a very simple a very simple method constantly remembering his name and chanting his glory constantly remembering the god just we are going on chanting his name rama krishna saranam ramakrishna there is a beautiful song ram krishna ramakrishna means remembering and i am taking refuge at your feet oh lord i am taking refuge at your feet and now the devotee is almost all over now it has become all almost a state song of the ramakrishna mission ramakrishna ramakrishna ramakrishna like that just we are going on musing like this when you are bathing when you are cooking when you are driving when you are going ramakrishna and when you are thinking like that suppose in the red light when you are waiting for the green signal look at the sky there is a cloud you think that bhagavan srirama krishna is sitting on that cloud just like this and looking at you imagine that the squatting the bhagavan is sitting you can see his feet you can see his hands you can see how he is sitting over there and then he is looking at you just imagine and where you are with god how just by imagining and continuously when you are going on thinking of god what will happen your mind will become pure how it will become pure because the impurity that is the object of this world are totally absent when the object of this world is totally absent when it is not there your mind is pure this is the only purity and impurity we do not understand what is purity and all people will be marking their forehead and these and that they think pure it looks good that's true i also sometimes apply because when the people they come over here and look at me they touch my feet with grater because that is necessary also and when you see with the these dresses you know that reminds us that we are monks we are supposed to behave like this and the western world when you are walking working when you are putting on the as they call civilian dress this is not army does but still they say the civilian dresser then you are forgetting what you who you are but you have to go on remembering i i don't belong to this world so your thought your manners your behavior your thinking constantly 100 times you should be alert i'm away from all this so that is the way we have to think of so this is the thing let me tell you one thing this is a great sentence god can be seen you can see god unbelievable way in a so simple way he is telling as if anyone just now god can be seen then he is telling the vedas say that god is beyond mind and speech i think i was telling you many of you who are attending my classes the sirama krishna he never says anything after that one can raise a question philosophical question o naren he who was rama he who was krishna in this ramakrishna in this body but not according to your vedanta see immediately he said that according to vedanta there is no avatara so if he had stopped over there he who was ramo he who was krishna is in this body immediately people with the frowning they will be writing how srama krishna say like that according to vedanta he has already answered according to vedanta you need not to bother about that vedanta means here also he says god can be seen how because in the veda it says the bang mana agocharam the mind it cannot reach over there the side the eye cannot go over there thought cannot go over there they all return back in the veda we always read and here he's telling veda says that god is beyond mind and speech bach means speech mana means mind so you cannot even express about god because you do not know what is god you cannot express her one of our swamis used to give the arguments sometimes some people used to say there is no god at all there is to say i must go and touch your feet because you are the only person who knows about god if you don't know about god and how can you say with such a confidence that there is no god how can you know if you have no idea how can you know that there is a that animal that's called llama it was a mixture the llama we had one lama heart and ganges and i have a desire to go to peru to see a llama now if you don't have the idea which islam i was traveling in gujarat suddenly one a shot of a cow and a sort of a mixture of cow and horse and very forcefully one animal jumped across the road and the driver said nilgai nilgai i had an idea nilgai means nil means green so i was thinking that it will be totally green and guy means a cow so green cow so that conception i was now when i saw that animal just like any other ordinary so if you don't know you cannot recognize so similarly if you are telling there is no god that means you have pakka complete idea about god that's why she was so confident about god so that is the reason one cannot say they may say i have not seen god or heard anything from him so i have doubt about god that can be okay but you cannot say here god sudama krishna is selling veda said that god is beyond mind and speech the meaning of this is that god is unknown to the mind which mind he is explaining salama krishna attest to worldly objects so ramakrishna never attended schools he never read any upon each other veda but he used to go to the monks and he used to sit by their side he used to listen their arguments used to listen to their discourses he used to listen to the recitals and he had a photogenic memory he used to remember all this he himself has not read but he knew whole thing this is the first and secondly from his own experience of realization he knew what is what so that's why he is telling like this that the god is unknown to the mind which is attached to the worldly objects so that is the reason vaisnava charan he is telling vaishnava charan he is a very famous devotee of sirama krishna used to say god is known by the mind and intellect that are pure so the ramakrishna himself could say but no he will never take the credit of something which he is not telling he has heard it from someone so he is quoting him perfectly and telling god is known to that mind which is pure here we find the same thing in the bible blessed are those who are pure in heart for they shall see god is it not the same the same confidence you can see god the same authority that jesus is also telling you can see god but unfortunately we are going on telling we are sinners we are sinners we are sinners and purchasing with with great cost it i don't know how much at least the four feet by four feet place so that we will be there inside that ah the under the earth and waiting for the final call and then we will go to heaven and i was hearing from someone they were telling if you want a place which is very calm and quiet and not by the side of the road you are not getting the disturbed by the sound of the vehicles and then there is a flower garden etc the cost is even when we are dying there is also choice after death we do not know where we are but the people conception has become like this we have to wait for a long time so comfortable place is necessary i don't know someday it will be that they will be demanding that after my dead there should be air cooler because it is so hot and in the the far house when they used to die at that measure there they used to give all keep all those things that was very desirable and there's to kill all the slaves and the slave women's because who will serve him when he is in the heaven so they used to go along with then this is the conception the conception of heaven conception of god can you appreciate those conceptions now in this modern age we have to think we are simply going on continuing just because somebody told something and why not say why how so these are the questions we can get the answer from bhagavan sirama krishna who realized why we have to we can see god right now how with a purified mind how the mind can be purified then sudama krishna is telling they seek the company of holy men again and again every almost every page of the gospel he is telling seek the company of holy men satsang satsang satsang sadhu-sanga so that is so great the people i have seen in the temples they are so eager to go and bow down before the all their images all the deities good and then they will be burning the light then they will be chanting then they will be showing all the lighting sex before but never listening they are not at all interested to listen and they don't have time also if the time is there no patience so when they are finished with the gods they will go down to the kitchen so in between there is no time to listen that's why bhagavan sirama krishna this is the importance of sirama krishna and we are very few because nobody likes it when you tell the truth when you tell that you have to be sincere very few followers when you say something just oh you just go over there do like this and then when you are holding your ear and sitting up and down for three times all your scenes are over next again you are free from sin and continue again people are happy but are we not really cheating them in the name of religion it's a complete in the beginning you can say yeah you come and do this that is the way they always bring and then they should get the education and elevate themselves this is the duty of the ramakrishna mission monks and the devotees why dharma i really i believe it and this is our holy duty to tell people and to practice be and make swami vivekananda say bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling only three what is that holy company second practice prayer and third listen to the instruction of the guru this is also very very important listen to the instruction of the guru without that you cannot make any progress but you should not think that the human guru is my only guru no the guru is only god but the god's words are coming through a human being and that is the reason you should have the respect for him and whatever he said it is not his own words it is the guru parampara the guru parampara these things are coming down it is not just he thought and said no particularly i do not know about others but about the ramakrishna mission gurus all the in charges of the ramakrish vedanti societies are gurus so that is the difference between the india and the western world particularly america and great europe but the swamis are in church armies or gurus they give initiation but where from this come from the traditional guru curve from that tradition it is coming and they are only becoming the mouthpiece and they are delivering that up to that they are trying their best at the same time the blessings of god is coming down this is not so simple in the ramakrishna mission particularly i know in the chicago those who are getting the blessings must be all over the gurus after the initiation they will be touching one thing on your head that is swamiji's relics can you believe it here sitting in america so this is the way we have to believe the guru and this guru three things then only surama krishna is advising listen to the holy person go to the holy person listen to him again and again and again and again because so many dots are there already accumulated on our mind on our mirror so we have to rub those clean those when you hear from here when you hear oh this is very good when you go you are go out five minutes ten minutes we forget so that is why again and again you have to come and listen to the same words one person who used to serve suramar krishna he used to live with suramar krishna so wherever suramar krishna is going he used to go and he used to hear the surah question is selling the same thing again and again then he became bored why do you say the same thing to everyone then suramar krishna said bashko volvo turkey i must say this what that is up to you he didn't give him that to answer because stop him like that you shut up you don't know why i'm doing this because this is my prerogatory i know again and again you are not harping helping they will never understand so that we are here when we are reading over here you can see that again and again sirama krishna is telling that tapasha you have to do and you must have to make the tapasha and telling this purify the mind these three things what one is going to the holy person second prayer and third listening to the guru these things purify the mind the moment our mind is purified we can see god he said jesus said and this established truth but how to make the mind purified that answer is also there and here he said yoga yet yet to where there is no thought waves that mind is called as dead mind and tadibachar tapa and that is called tapasha austerity to make the mind dead dead means not thinking anything of this world that is called takasha through austerity and what is that austerity practice practice and practice again again and again then only it is possible then the scriptures they say this is called liberation moksha means liberation the sastra siddhant what is the sastra scripture and who are the where from the scripture the books they learned about it because they realized the souls they told this the sastra and delusion we constantly go on thinking about something and creating an idea and then we are reacting or acting accordingly why we are acting like this because we have created a picture an idea and that is why this delusion we are going to die that is no delusion someday we are going to die all of us someday we will go some early some little afterwards that's all and there if somebody goes on thinking i am not going to die this is a delusion the people will surely criticize you some people will be there always criticizing you srama krishna bhagavan buddha jisu krishna sri krishna vivekananda all they got this some people criticizing them so some people will criticize me also why should i be mad let them criticize let me go so we are free from delusion the moment you think no one should criticize me you are in mohawk you are in delusion when i was very young as a brahmacari myself and another senior brahmacharya we followed one senior swami to bombay at the book fair we are in advaithasrama we never learned the puja we learned how to sell books so we used to take books in the uh the national book fair international book fair the bombay that time so you went over there that swami in his own way he was arranging because he was the leader and we too used to say see that xiaomi is asking us to do like that if we could do like this it would have been for better we if we we could sell books we could attract people all we were going on giving our ideas next year there was a again that was in delhi now that senior brahmachari he got sannyasa he became the leader myself and another brahmachary we became the this time we found i noticed that he is in a separate room with two in the same room two separate beds and after the work when he came back again we are discussing the same thing had we if we could do like this we are not having that freedom otherwise we could do better so that then finally that was a calcutta book fair is a huge book here i got the opportunity to become the leader that the manager swamiji told now this time you are the leader i was a vermicelli but even then he told me that you are the leader so then i pointed out what are the things that we used to discuss that should be avoided no one should say a single word i should keep all the drinking water and this facility that facility for the swamis for the brahmacharyans for all people everything i planned and then i did one day this was the noon time there was not much rash only one or two customers so two brahmacharyans they were they were my assistant so they were sitting inside the small room and their tea etc was there so they were drinking tea and i was selling that book i was talking so these are the book these are the book you can purchase this is a good one they're like that then i came to near to that place and i could hear they are telling why this brahmacari maharaja is telling like this he's spending so much of money for i hired a car so that our swamis at their will they can go back to asrama take rest and come back i thought by that they will be happy now they are criticizing for that so you are going to get the criticism when you are working so one should not be mad brother israel nobody is criticizing that means something wrong with me if nobody is criticizing something wrong with me so i should be very careful so that is why two things we should do what praying to god please guide me second whatever you think from within good for the others not for myself good for the others good for the association good for the center shanga you do you will see you are in the right path so how this can by shadow sangha if you are going and listening to those monks in your
