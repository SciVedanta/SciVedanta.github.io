[133. Panchama Veda 133- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ce0vOhqB30)

good evening let us begin the Pancham evader by reciting this mantra tava cotton rhythm dr. G venom Co V be rewritten Col Machado servin among golem three Magatha come boo be grinning PE gory dodging ah then the last class we were we just began to discuss about this one the ramakrishna with the devotees adduction Asia is the part - the part one we have already studied to iterate and this is the part two it was Sunday it was December 9 1883 I am reading from the 330 pages of the gospel of Salaam additional then ceramic Asia was describing the condition of mahaprabhu sri chaitanya the chaitanya mahaprabhu how he used to behave in his spiritual moods to say that he said master Shi tanya experienced three states of mind mind either increased ages states of mind first the conscious state when his mind dwelt on the grows and the circle second the semi-conscious state when his mind entered the causal body and was observed the bliss of divine intoxication third in most state the highest state when his mind was masked in the great cause now here he says it is the mind so when we talk about the god-realization when you talk about the spiritual experiences where it is coming to our mind not on the body not on anything on the mind so the mind is the main instrument again the Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna said with this mind you cannot realize God you need a purified mind a mind which is completely pure same mind when attest with all these worldly things so the first thing sri chaitanya mahaprabhu his mind is built on the gross and the subtle the gross body means as in the Vedanta we always and in the other word gita it gives in a beautiful wave maha bua ankara with the abject amoeba in Brioni the Shaykh injure pancetta India Gojira these are total is the maja Buddha these are the gross Maha Bua the five then stool abhi sure again five in the real tin mon bodhichitta uncle 424 top 12 so these are the twenty four tattwas truths by which this whole thus world retaken universe each and everything is made up so this is called the gross when our mind goes out each and every one of us is experiencing this this is the experience of each and every one now - we draw the mind from this and go into the certain and then to the subtlest and then to the core these are the stages we drawing the mind why should I have to be drawn this is the question in a normal way my mind is going out and we can see all these things we can see we can taste we can hear we can touch all these things we can do we can enjoy and sometimes we suffer so these things are going on suffering and enjoyment so why should I have to read through the mind from these because these are all temporary in the pancha - again the victor on the money someday will be studying the conjugacy the serious began to study the big Tyrande money he is telling that slowly slowly we have to give up what how to how to analyze from the gross to subtle subtle to subtle as thoughtless to the cause we have to go that these are the steps of the Vedanta so this way when we reach both of our cinema christie is giving the description of the chicken about Prabhu who was dreaming his mind is dwelling on that ordinary mind our mind always on the gross label so we always feel like this it is filled with that and from the young stage when the young when we are young if we start withdrawing our mind really because we it has not been colored or you can say contaminated by all these different things so check the nama Prabhu he first first mind is going to alt on the ghost and the subtle and what is the circle the last time also in the arc Nevada Shankar Acharya is mentioning about the circle punch a pranayama nobody approach it with a brutha these are called sukshma angam sukshma anger subtle body the one is gross body behind this is the subtle body and then again at the back of that is the causal body there is the main cause we have to go back to the that one and for that we have to give up these were nama and Rupa this nama Rupa the world of this nama Rupa when we can give it nama means name Rupa means form everything in this universe is nothing birth the combination of this two it has a name it is a fault and as because it is all changing so it is not permanent our goal is to reach to the permanent so we are we trying and going back going back going back that is the when we next stage we go that's called circling and from the circle when you go he says that from the second semi conscious state when his mind entered into the causal body observed in the pleas of divine intoxication when it is going to the causal body and the beasts of white one there is not two so obviously mind is full with that and that one is full of joy and that full of joy sometimes people say consciousness sometimes they God sometimes they Brahman in different way they try to express those who have experienced it so obviously you have to go back to that and that is the goal and then when the mind was merged in the great cause that is the last page the last page is that and to experience this songs ramakrishna sterling this agrees very well with the five oceans pancha culture be laksana art MA we will study began third that is the first tape Francesco Shah galaxina Atma since this is not actually the way we understand religion the religion has to a different way of expression one the external way it is rituals and other things which almost all of us can understand and we can practice second it goes to philosophy so obviously when the philosophy it becomes very subtle is only the thinking why I am doing this the answer of that why so here it says it agrees very well with the kosher sponge a kosher we simply say body and mind but bonanzaville said no how because they have experienced it they analyzed it and more gross to subtle that is the analysis is the system of analysis the puncher culture the Annamayya mano maya it goes in this way see Rama Krishna is explaining explaining the annamaya and the pranamaya that goes the gross body corresponds to the on no Maya and the pranamaya these are the two dis called gross body subtle body mano Maya and big gonorrhea the mind the body at the whole world is nothing but the mind and big Annamayya the knowledge and then finally it goes to the causal body onon the Maya kosher we always think that if we reach to that at his great this is the final stage sometimes when the people they are climbing the Everest Mount Everest they can go up to the just below Steve the lasted above below the summit last day below the summit but that the most difficult part why because there there's so much of joy my don't want to work I am fine over here why should I I'm not going down everything is one he starts enjoying that condition and don't like to strive further and then it goes beyond and Marge's with the great cause so up to that is also the third stage also it says the third innermost age when the mind was merged in the great cause below that bunch of osha there is also the seal there's also that cover that's also temporary so that is why see Ramakrishna is giving it is the causal body was observed in the place of divine intoxication but he saw that is also not the tongue so can you imagine if we make a pyramid like this we can understand the 24 doctors at the back that is on the base then it goes then it goes then it goes and the top is so subtle to reach over there and to make yourself stablished over there is really good difficult most difficult so jesus said blessed that those were pure in heart but he shall see God he is not talking that only if you will see anyone can see but the mind should be pure and what is the condition of the purity is completely free from all these worldly things purity and how to get out of these connections of this worldly things unselfishness not that you have to go and lock yourself in a corner of the room or in a secluded place hiding yourself that is the mostly the people think in that way but Salam Krishna completely broke it and he said why you can see God by closing your eyes can't you see God by opening your eyes so that is the speciality of vagabonds the ramakrishna most of the people you will see the soap that our holy people if you see the pictures all with closed eyes with a rosary in hand with a closed eyes most of our grandfathers pictures are like that and also the holy people closing their eyes why we have to go inside Ramakrishna is asking in the opposite way way whatever you see is nothing but the same God can't you see God is open eyes there is nothing else except God so the wonderful condition why should I have to be afraid of so many other things I am turning my face beside I see who my god this is here so again I am turning my face oh my god is it here and where we will then you turn to the sky there are also so many things are flying it is so impossible to turn your face close your eyes so if you can only see each and everything that the manifestation of the same God it is completely over so finally the great cause as manifested in this way and when we go back easily to that great cause what remains no one can say when we say when people are telling after experience that this is the joy complete joy full of joy that is a different stage it is even not the vinyl and when the final stage see Ramakrishna is telling that you have to go the when chitinous mind marched in that t is capital that he would go into Samadhi this is called miracle for at the jerison rd dara and shaitan jeremy's in earth just like this stone the dural Samadhi Samadhi means the loss of the yoga so the terminology used of the yoga community the Somali and nearly kalfa we have again and again discussed about that culpa means some object by which we reach over there and me means negative there is no object then what original and what is that original then they say I am sorry we cannot express it you have to experience it yourself the subjective knowledge here in the we will find that in the punch of the she is a very famous book some bead a guru / the big dirty some be they say call it zombie now some say Artemis on serum and some like this is a bunch of the sheet that Swami vadhana he said some being the Chitina the consciousness our that Sarasa mission the women wing of the ramakrishna mission not being actually they're completely separate but they publish one magazine every month some beat their consciousness this some be eco rubra that is only one the beat that they you cannot break it in the bhagavad-gita we find about the art man is saying you cannot cut it you cannot burn it you cannot wait it you cannot dry it the same Artman is called some big a guru one ability that is on the first chapter for sloka of the pancetta she and again in the 42 smoker of the pancetta she it describes how you go this is the unique way they say there's a the moon job gossip gossip is that only the gas we know that Glasser let's come over here to this it come here this winter Glasser that is going we are discussing about how to reach to the Atma according to the pancha regime we are reading the gospel of sadhana krishna only taking the help of the Pangaea she and some big a guru pond a big today the consciousness is one you cannot break it but how to reach to that oneness then he says if you are going on as the internal pit of the Moon yoga's can be separated from outer covering one after another going on taking out the seeds of the grass ultimately is a so the cell can be distinguished from the three bodies the gross subtle and the cause there's also self when you are discussing about that only the three bodies and then also we can say that puncha kosha that is also but here it says gain the self alone amar emerged as the supreme brahman the cell alone emerge as supreme brahman bhagavati Ramakrishna has given the same description in a another way is if you go on opening an onion if you are just covered opening that outer cover outer cover outer cover finally what you see you ingest into onions are available in every absorb just go on practicing that you see what is there what is there some will say nothing no that is everything because that is the the moment you open the cover what remains that is called Brahman and we had to reach to that and ceramic wizna he is going on giving the description of the chaitanya mahaprabhu while conscious of the outer world Chaitanya's and sang the name of god and while in the state of partial consciousness he danced with the devotees and while in the inmost Liat of consciousness he remained absorbed in Samadhi so these three stages the first you can sing you can talk a second stage joy is so much you cannot talk the only thing that you can do you can dance with a Shiva in great joy he is dancing the dance is the expression of the great joy and only in a physical way that we are trying to express and finally everything stopped so in the Samadhi so this is the ultimate joy cannot be expressed through body or mind all words so do Samadhi the den serum location aim to himself his master heating at the different steps of his own mind there is much similarity between Satan and the master three more master marsha he is observing ramakrishna purse last two three years and when see ramakrishna is giving the example of caitanya mahaprabhu he is thinking at the same thing I see in him too then sri ramakrishna stealing shaitan was divine love internet love incarnate that is the incarnation but completely loved and that is the reason it was very difficult for him to express most of the time used to sing and dance and to forget external world he came down to art to teach people how to love God so we will we know how what is love we have love for so many other things but when we love God what happens to us Hinduism is a great religion and it gives the we out to each and every want to reach to that if you like to go through philosophy you have the bear if you like to go through work if you have to go through devotion and meditation all here at Ratana mappable is taking up the people's mind that through love and how to love forget even your body we have seen the love of the mothers only last Sunday it was the Mother's Day and we have seen the mothers the last bit of food also she will distribute and then she will drink a glass of water in such a way as if she is also satisfied and she will go and sleep the children won't understand that the mother is sleeping without food they are hungry they are asking food and she is all going on really when they are grown up if the observed then only they can see that how the mothers are sacrificing so much so that is the because of the love the same mother cannot do it for others just because I love my children so out of that love all this physical discomforts also she is bearing chaitanya mahaprabhu came to teach the love how to love God even the forgetting the body there is no need of utter yoga is mentioned suddenly he's mentioning about the hata yoga a devotee does compare what is this utter yoga like now it is very clear the began thing and the people want to have the spiritual experience what are you is not necessary it's only to keep the body little fit so that she says a man practicing at a yoga 12 a great deal on his body he washes his intestine by means of the bamboo tube trees but that this all a description he is giving and he says that the be done teen do not accept her to yoga there is also Raja yoga the Raja Yoga describes how to achieve union with God through the mind by means of discrimination and bhakti so this is called Raja yoga swami vivekananda Patanjali Yoga darshan he has analyzed that and that he has given the name Raja Yoga Raja means the highest the greatest so Raja Yoga by means of discrimination and bhakti both things are necessary but the Raja yoga only closing the eyes on to only practicing the astanga mark and fashiona pranayama pratyahara this is okay but discrimination which are oh why should I do it most of the time when the people they calm enough sharmaji can you teach meditation I say what is the purpose what do you want to do so that is the first thing that you have to finalize it then only you can start otherwise not the first thing of the hata yoga discrimination why do I need the discrimination and what is that discrimination actually discrimination between the temporary and the permanent the God is only permanent each and everything including my body and the Sun each and every thing is nothing but temporary because it is changing we can observe everything is changing the Sun is also changing my body is also changing mind is changing so anything that is changing cannot be the permanent so obviously my goal is to reach to the permanent and how to do that he says discrimination utter beach architecture that begins the great that work at a beach Arkadelphia I mean bechara means between the temporary and the permanent one is only permanent sometimes people call it God Abaddon tingly Brahman yogi is called Artman so that that is the be Chara that consciousness and it says at the same time Rock T the devotion the devotion to God only if you are having that capacity to analyze and moving towards the consciousness that is guiana Marga bhakti the devotion they are also having the discrimination they are also having the concentration they are also having that karma that is also so all the fourth eyes having all this for but thrust is given on that particular path here it says discrimination and octi now this weekend will be going to ganges and we'll have a retreat on Nara be a rock team the one gentleman was describing nada as a reporter so people can understand Narada is roaming everywhere and collecting the information and give but he was a great devotee and he's we he has described there are many others per Ashura others were there but not as the thing is in a wonderful way and saddam o krishna he is killing that is the real prescription for the modern-day people what is that Todd or pika akela Archer oughtta cut wish Maroney paramo Bakula ty t this is the narrative of thee Todd or pita tada is not he or she there is no Shiva or Shakti is only the consciousness it is only the Brahmin it is only the self a dart man or a PITA offering Aquila Archer otta each and every action that we are doing offering cleaner I am doing but that I is completely absent doing for you so that is called completely giving to him and then afterwards aroma Bakula the love so the bechara and bhakti and that's what see Rama Krishna stilling discrimination and bhakti this yoga is good what are you guys not good and life of a man in the Kali Yuga is dependent on food food means all these things that is dependent naturally these are the two things which must have the Ramakrishna then the description our master Masha is giving each and every place wherever he was present not that all the day's all the movements all the moments when this master the teacher he was presenting duction Asia he has noted Ramakrishna was standing in the road by the side of the knob earth now what with the small place where in the beginning that was main tactually that smaller double storey building meant for the musicians early in the morning or the evening sometimes this to play the music so that people coming to visit the temple there is to have the nice music just to enjoy that then afterwards it was converted into a place residential place where cinema krishna's own mother is cleaved and mass or a demonic baby so they stood Eve over the earth they just call now but and he was standing by the side he was on his way to his room he saw the that three mom sitting on the somewhere and meditating hello you were here and then immediately is it get results very soon if you practice a little then someone will come forward to help you so this is the assessment of ceramic resna because he could see the mind so whenever someone came to him sometimes used to say he is a good person but doesn't belong to this that means this Idol lodge and see Ramakrishna's ideology is manifested in this way he is a good person he is also progressing but not to this and said but you that master who is noting down the to him he said you will realize God very quickly because you have advanced a lot in the master Marche looked up at the Masters turtle he remained sitting on the floor because when the Kodama Krishna suddenly appeared before he even said you are almost reaching to the gold the naturally the great joy see Ramakrishna time is right for you look at it if someone came to tell us that what is the joy the time is right for you the motherboard does not break the shell of the egg until the right time arrives what I told you is needed your height you that what I told you is indeed the RAM sorry indeed your ideal that master Mercia didn't disclosed ideal and that is called I am the God our God is awesome the philosophical idea and that is given to someone and that is your ideal and you should develop your life in that way that is called mantra diksha my there are so many gods and goddesses are there for the Hindus and of them the Guru said this is your idea the see Ramakrishna is reminding you what I told you is indeed your idea see Rama Krishna again mentioned to aim a spiritual idea the spiritual ideal is again repeating to me today I gave the caption the spiritual idea different people they are coming their ideals are different and that is the uniqueness of the Ramakrishna some are very active they are not selfish people unselfishly they are working going to the fields and helping the people and arranging so many things very active people hardly baby six for meditation they will come to bow down to God and they'll take little name name of God but to go on repeating the name of God all the time 24 hours some people the Jian ammaji will be discriminating if you go to Balu what I have seen the Swami's some are really very working and all people appreciate them only they are working but there are some they would work that way whatever you ask them to do they will do but most of the time they are discriminating the reading books they're discriminating their Idol is dead like if you read the great master and the restraint of the Ramakrishna mission when it was doing up the one Swami was there and afterwards he became Xiaomi avid Ananda he had the habit of reading books he could read really the Sanskrit and his understanding is to do that and his love was in that but an organization means so many other Swami's are there someone should go someone should clean someone should do these someone should do that too that way it was organized and his duty was to clean the vessels after the cooking and heating and all that you were supposed to and every time used to say I will do it afterwards and used to go and his to eat and read that was not accepted by others when the leader came Narendra nob he was their leader all of the same age almost and they've complained against him and he said Kali is sitting inside the room and not coming out and who will do his duty then immediately Narinder not swami becomes a he say as Salam o Krishna announced that he is the leader everyone accepted him then immediately he said I will do that allow him to study that is for him don't disturb him Kali portion dark again afterwards Shani Avedon and you were the great scholar and all the sannyas a month or exit exit to that he collected and he gave wonderful then afterwards karma yoga also when he came over here just to give the wonderful lectures writing books researching all that way he manifested but the physical labor he could not do too many others dig deep so that all that was there so they always our senior Swami's they say ramakrishna mission means is a bouquet of flowers different type of lobster there may be very good flower and may be very ordinary flower but that is the beauty and sometimes leaves are also there because all together that is that okay so this is the beauty to so many varieties of people are there but they are going to the same goal because of the idea that is the idea the see Ramakrishna idea some is working some is meditating some is discriminating some is devoted but at the same time all are together reaching to the same goal that is the beauty and that is called the idea master master usually he tried to practice jhana yoga and used to constantly discriminate and argue with Ramakrishna Ramakrishna told him don't argue that is not your bath I am telling you God is there God can be realized believe it and promise to me that you are not wasting your time reading that type of book and arguing with devotional books that is for you thanks Collider all are not the same but if we try to copy someone we unnecessarily waste our energy this is my path and I'm going to follow it and by that way I am going to reach over there ultimately God realization that is the goal whether he is coming through this way or he is going in that way that doesn't matter at all so that is the main thing I saw you know that nowadays people always claim different type of messages good messages someone sent me and in the work sack there's a new app there someone sent me the life is a wonderful exam but some people try to copy others forgetting that each has given a different question paper so if you question them is so completely different if you are copying the other one even completely fair this is my path and this way every go Ramprasad he was a great singer and his complete all his devotion came out through the songs only and he never that way we never give them description in his biography that used to meditate for 12 hours and used to do these live constantly he's composing and singing and his crying is spraying he is fighting with his mother and that way he is realizing so that is called idea each and every one according to his nature according to his temperament according to his understand he is getting his own idea be satisfied into that and proceed to that and we should you even ready to that goal that is the thing see Ramakrishna told that what I told you is indeed your idea Swami Vivekananda came he was a gana Marquis constantly his discriminating his mind is very sharp master moisture by age he was little digit senior than the vivekanandan or in Bernard he also followed tried to follow and Serrano Krishna told know when someone that many people they were fasting for a varchar not in the to know I am hungry I'm going to eat why should I trust master Marche also trying to do that immediately same Krishna so that is not your path you should follow this every ekkada she that is a special occasion you must first that's for him and for Narendra don't try to copy is totally different type the people is to bring food some pistol could understand why they are bringing with all their prayers and in the ramanuja in the be sister advaitha instilling that is a very very special thing the food what food you were eating and from whose hand that's why in a misunderstanding in our society but Saddam Oh Krishna could understand instead don't eat this food but keep it for Noren nothing is going to happen to him because of the his body consciousness was not there the first day when he came to see ramakrishna ramakrishna saw name and then select soliloquized he said can there be such a personality with high sattva-guna in calcutta a city like Calcutta - like this sattva-guna his mind is all on the top level never connected with the body so obviously whatever food he is eating and things that he is doing not connected with the ego let him do it very difficult to understand must emerge and all others mr. ping Ramakrishna is favoring him he is not the questioner favor the question of idea you must practice in this oh you must go in this way when you join first in the ramakrishna vision so any brahma cherries oh you can see me that my I was also very strong body and another brahma cherry came my friend although the same age group he was very lean and teen and he was a very very devoted is to go and lie down before the mother's temple in building mud and he'll be praying for half an hour one hour in the same posture he'll be lying down and praying and praying and praying and praying and we need to get up we could feel that he has cried so much with his player I once or twice I like that I tried to but it was impossible up to five minute statement is a whole can lie down like that it's so difficult one of our Swamiji noticed it and just to make him he is to ask me a go and give him a shake like you you should follow your path right or no show me he's a totally different way mine is different so I used to go and hold him but at the same time I knew his path is totally different still now after 40 years same way he is practicing he is going he never cares for the lecture or writing articles are going to talk to people nothing he chews a little in the ramakrishna mission you must have to do some work and usually when we are taking food that given by the devotees you to give them back something so he's some whatever responsibility so little sis mentality he is practicing following is a his background his science so naturally he was given to look after some that type of work he is carefully doing morning and evening another time going on praying there is a way you cannot follow him he going to imitate him we will be inspired but it is very difficult so it is better to follow your own nature and to develop but one thing is very common that is your IT of your eye to Raja God is our goal and to reach to God if I feel that by singing my mind is becoming calm and composed and my mind is becoming free from the ego that is your bath by working by meditating by discriminating by prayer that should be expressed should be given so see Ramakrishna is telling the spiritual idea what is the spiritual Idol particular thing good for you that is called spiritual idea and that we have to understand and sometimes guru understands that and tell this is your idea follow it have complete read on guru and go on the guru when he is telling you this is not he it is coming from the god the moment he says like that apparently oh this man is telling like this again no not like that it's going from the god and when these days is coming from that particular tab but the water comes from the main source is the god that is the water is flowing to the tab reaching to you to that particular tab and that tab we consider as guru but this is the idea whatever the idea that is what see Ramakrishna say and then he said one can certainly see God through the practice of spiritual discipline this is a unique statement one can certainly see God whether the Brahmin Kshatriya Vaishya or this country or that country nothing nothing nothing anyone by practicing spiritual discipline and that is the question what is the spiritual discipline and he says the vision of God is the only goal of human life issue a lot minutia Giovani hood - again and again he is to say issue Allah the spiritually we have to go and god-realization the vision of God that is the ultimate a human life how spiritual practice what is the spiritual practice he said in many different places - three things sadhu sanga then what million bars third solitude the legend Bosh then world discrimination and then finally clear first piece here is throbbin Manan needed Yasin needed the asana server now you have to here here here if you go and listen all you have to read books and after reading books the problem is the young minds when they are reading books they understand things in a totally different way so that is not completely clarified information is there they'll be some people were very intelligent they can quote from different scriptures but that is also not the thing understanding so Sidhu Sangha with the law Sabu again one who has already realized God or whose mind is completely free from karma and closer free from bar sonars there is a holy man how you'll understand that against democracy link that you will not have any desire when the worldly desires have gone completely the only man now whatever he says that you have to listen first second you have to apply according to your own capacity then some people like ramen Mar she is a very high Advaitic type of realizations we doubt the primary preparation if you try to follow him what will happen so that's why you're right yo your ideal means you have to understand what is good for me or suppose you have to go to whatever he says that is your ideal and don't locate these and then continue and go for praying for others appreciate others whoever is going on that way great so that is called so bad by practicing the spiritual discipline and to practice this only to go and listen to the spiritual talks that also need discipline today I go oh nice that man has come over there beautifully is giving the lock lecture I go over there and listen mean because another person hundreds people at the air $20 ticket so I go and listen that way doesn't do the regular this is you have to go the sravana that is called not only study the server now literally sharing their only hearing not that you had to understand it so subhana then monana constantly going on brooding on that particular it applicable to me can I follow that is a beautiful ideal very high ideal wonderful thing but is it possible for me to follow if not well let me once again go back so let me listen there must be a path for me so they go back they go back to go back and then define what this is the part that is according to my temperament but some of the disciplines you have to follow like getting up in the early morning that is the traditional way it goes and then you have to practice meditation in the early morning half an hour before the sunrise the same so accordingly you are getting out and you're washing and then meditating or praying and then reading the books and again you're doing little other work and trying to avoid the worldly people those who are constantly talking about the thing that is which is too much worldly so if I sell this land I am going to get this profit I do these and I get to that table all worldly things as possible maximum possible ever then people are criticizing people all the time hankering for name and thing avoid those companies as maximum as possible and then control your mind we draw your mind and go on constantly praying and different type of advices many different people they have given our Brahman and the G that are invisible of sadhana Krishna he said keep a photo of that would always with you take it out see immediately you are reminded and go on repeating his name praying to him whatever good thing that you are going to eat before that mentally offer it to God anything good that you see or hear mentally offer it to God and by daddy what is happening constantly remembering God the constant presence of God practice in the presence of God the practice practice practice comes gently at your limit that is called spiritual practice spirit is circle and then the growth is the body so naturally spiritual practice is that and I am NOT going to harm anyone rather I am going to help everyone so that is called spiritual friends we will conclude today by reading again once again one can certainly see God through the practice of spiritual discipline in the next class we mean touch at this point what are the spiritual disciplines or the different type as because it is a Hinduism you can understand those who are practicing the path of guiana they had different type of discipline those who are practicing yoga are the P or the Karma different type of discipline but some common and some spatial so these are the spiritual disciplines the only thing is very common I am going to realize God and only by practicing these I am sure that I am going to get Lescott and in this very life yo J is a VAD is Atta Septimus be much easier they need ma te Venus T and what is that in the baton so they say booty booty shimmy Chitra V da ha prick a small low con of Otago NP and seeing that God that consciousness that drum on that self in every being manifested in different names and form I am impressed I am in peace and in please that is the goal the vision of God is the only goal of human life only gold thank you very much
