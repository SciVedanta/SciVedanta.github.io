[136: Panchama Veda 136- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQY1teKAx-4)

you good evening let us begin with this torah Tavo khatam rhythm topped achieve annum kuvira's Edom cosmos sharp 'him iran among golem srimad article boobie Glennon ta buried our jannah the sir now the ceramic is not in our last class we were reading from the Gospel of ceramic isne today we will be studying from 337 page but in the 36th place 336 page he he was telling one cannot renounce by mail wish this is very important sometimes some people under some situation they think that they can renounce the world but renouncing the world the great thing is not possible for all that's why Marsha Adam any baby he/she is to give lot of respect to the sannyasins those who have renounced apparently it looks that is that ordinary what they are doing just they have changed the dress are living a bachelor life that's all it is not so that is the main thing those who are really striving to realize God that life is a blessed life unthinkable so this ceramic is name is mentioning why the reason he is tearing one cannot renounce by the mere wish there are four ruptal mom inherited tendencies and the like so inherited tendencies so one is all be able to think even to realize God thinking to renounce the world is impossible for many many many people so some people who are thinking they're coming out they're trying but sometimes they cannot be successful some of the spur young boys who come and then after some time they leave young boys and girls they come to embrace this life but after some time they leave who forced them to bring over here who takes them out karma brought up the Karma so they got that opportunity to come but they could not continue some people to come and then afterwards something happened physical ailments or mental del D so this is very very important those who are truly announcer one must appreciate them one must have lot of respect for them in the society this is very very essential otherwise the ideal is lost the human being and the animal the difference is here that everything is there and I can take I can enjoy but I won't so that capacity that the human being is having then only it can come and in the doctor we have already discussed many times because the ramakrishna is repeating and we have also discussed it here actually three different types of Karma's are there they say the result of karma what is that one is sanchita Agra me Proctor just three almost all the Hindus they didn't know sanchita means stood up what has already been done result has also come but activity from that result has not started so this is just waiting it is in the storehouse not used there is called Sanjeev Agha me whatever we are doing now so that will be it will be open in the next so that's called a gamma a gamma means is it will be coming but are upped this is the brought up the whatever now we are doing that comes under this category the parameter the past we did now that result has started acting so the product the previous earned result started giving and this way the fruits we are having either enjoyment or suffering everything because of that now one should understand this why again and again Hinduism they are talking about this two one is the Karma theory and punar janma bada the rebirth theory why rebirth theory because again and again we are coming and what is the Karma whatever we have done before the result is coming that is why it is so important important because we have to reach to the root and get the liberation and for that we need to understand these mind karma my work and the work is not only physical mental also my thought should be pure my action should be pure and then only I can go beyond this circle of birth and death that is the ultimate holes in the ISM is standing on this and we cannot go beyond this because this is not just we are our emotional thinking this is based on a lot of discussion and final this coming to this decision why people suffer why this is happening now suppose is a question sometimes comes suppose someone has already realized God in this life is it that immediately his product karma will stop assist no in one of the scripture says / Optim puja a diva not to be done below by eight Sutra Buddha Buddhist leisure the other bus card ku tuna MOOC as the knowledge is not lost at the time of dreamless sleep should be the dreamless sleep when I went to goes to that condition when I come back again my previous knowledge everything is there I'm a doctor I go to sleep and when I come back once again I get back get back that knowledge so that is the thing similarly when I have realized God that knowledge is remaining even though I am suffering even though I am having this so this is the main cause do in this body with so many things happen but at the same time we have to understand that product is continuing but at the same time I am free it doesn't matter what is happening marshals are money baby of course say it and see Ramakrishna also in different places that those who are trying to realize God practicing spirituality dream tapasya taking the name of God all their Karma's are lessened they were supposed to have tremendous thing in this life to suffer because of that prayer and the austere life and the dedication to God slowly that comes down that is the product of karma and see Ramakrishna is going on then he was talking with other people there is one sect that prescribes spiritual discipline in the company of women a different type of sex he is discussing different type of people in different ways they are practicing and then we find in one place when see Ramakrishna is telling something the people who were listening are they practicing that master maya himself is exam example in means master measure way into walking alone in the pan chapati the people they came then they got are there all these descriptions I am skipping him aim wind alone when walking alone in the Panchavati he was walking alone that is important sometimes he is going to some place where there is no other people all alone then he thought about the Masters as assurance master means the Ramakrishna whatever the sadhana Krishna say am not only writing it down but also is pondering meditating on that assurance that God can be easily realized and in the scripture we find Shobana banana this is banana when we are listening something we must go on pondering over that every month at the end particularly in summer time here in Chicago we organize that retreat when the people go over there of course very busy people but if they can come in the Friday that that is the way the routine has we made Friday they are coming away from the job and all mind is over there and then the Friday night they sleep next morning they get up start with the chanting of the bhagavad-gita and Holy Scripture then they are going on listening all the devotees all around the subject that is there they are reading also about that going on discussing on that pondering over there at least one day so that gives a lot and lot of mental strength that is that is the reason spiritual are these retreats are necessary we go in a group then we listen something then the potluck is there and socializing and come back to sort of a picnic in the name of religion nothing that is also good but at the same time we have to understand if we are really sincere serious it should be two or three days we form the common theme and with the devotees and the same minded people then Olivia disc Masha Masha sivanna monana these are the opportunities if possible one should a bill and then develop and slowly slowly go beyond the Karma Paula that is very very essential and he was going on thinking to lead a life of intense renunciation say Ramakrishna is constantly talking with master Masha his mind is slowly blooming see Ramakrishna could understand that mind is ready slowly blooming we will find afterwards at half past 3:00 in the afternoon aim again entered the Masters room induction Isha and sat on the floor so that is showing the humbleness and dedication a teacher came along with students seeing those days also that system was there to introduce the young minds with the philosophy of India and Devinder ISM so his teacher he brought some the students to talk with the ceramic ashiness students naturally they were sitting over there teacher was asking question and he was asking question about the image worship so that time in the society a great question that all divots were going on discussions were going on about the image worship because some of the people and other religions they were continuously going on killing propagating image worship is a very lower type of religious practice why the God is all pervading how it is possible for God to be in that image so obviously it is a sacrilege it is going against God you must think in a different way going on that some people they were getting converted some people they were adjusting and some people and here see Ramakrishna he was there the God himself to demonstrate that that is nothing wrong and that is the reason long long back the Hindus they have introduced this to help people the ordinary people their mind all the time going here and there asked them to think about something bigger and without any form name and form is it possible for than the people to think it's not so obviously this image worship was introduced when they were asking the question doubts see Ramakrishna was telling what is wrong with image worship the began to see is that with antha means as the brahma semaj so they was always telling in the Vedanta there is no images etc okay began to say that Brahman manifest itself where there is existence light and love therefore nothing exists but Brahman so there is a simple way he was telling us because the students were also there so he was giving that simple that this is also possible then he's that was his own that was this wonderful way of teaching immediately give the example so the people can understand it is not that that is the only way that one has to do not that all through your life you have to worship the image he's telling how long's the small girls play with their dolls the simple because you need not to give any example so that we don't understand where it happened maybe in every household the children they always play like that particularly the girl children they they always play with the dolls how long they're and this is very interesting anywhere in the world not that the children's are getting education of the with the play with the doll in in same school nothing like that but anywhere in the world you go the girls the small little girls they are so fond of playing with the dolls even I was seeing in the TV and advertisement the parents are busy with the new house they have got and the small little girl she is also taking hard the doll and also feeding the doll and giving the proper dress so they are going out etc exit dog everywhere if you go to Africa in Asia America Sousa Ramakrishna is giving an example which each and every one can understand see the one attains God when one feels yearning for him when he said there he looked at the aim master master why the master marseilles because the great teacher he could understand Salama krishna to understand that his mind is opening up so he is guiding him and not very harshly but giving him some this the guidance in wonderful way one attains God when one feels yearning for him and intense restlessness is needed through it the whole mind goes to God so that is the main thing what is the condition to realize God that is the topic we were supposed to discuss but as because it's the gospel we are going on reading the different pages and we go along with that here is the main thing what is necessary to realize God intense yearning in many places in different ways this thing has been said all other things are okay but this is yours and the person who is trying to realize God that is his quality that he must feel otherwise it is impossible one attains God he was looking to that aim was sitting on the floor this thing is not looking at the teacher of the students he knew that this is the man who is getting ready and one attains God when one feels yearning for him and intense restlessness is needed through it the whole mind goes to God then he is giving the example a man had a daughter and she wanted where is my husband because he saw someone is having the husband and the marriage and all that she told where is my husband she was going on asking to her father the father told Govinda and they were having the family deity the Govinda the Krishna so the Govinda is your husband and she started crying to that Govinda why you are not coming to me I want to talk to you and to see you one must have childlike faith and the intense yearning that a child is having this is called anthropomorphic anthropomorphic means the Hinduism believe in that there is imposing human nature in God imposing human nature on the God that is anthropomorphic this is wonderful in Hinduism and how it is possible complete faith how it is possible intense prayer I have a complete faith that God is there and God should come because my father told that you are my husband he must have to come I saw that lady is having the husband and they are going together they're enjoying I also like my husband to come to me and with that simple faith and intense yearning the little girl is going on crying God appears see Ramakrishna to make this point more clear he is giving another example another story the story of the jutila recently I received one message at the video someone made a beautiful video then similarly one little girl she was killing to her grandma who are leaving by the side of the jungle and she was very much scared to cross the jungle path to reach to our school and she was dealing to the grandma I don't like to go to the school because I am scared and same way than the movie that grandma also is telling that you have to become a doctor and engineers stablished in the society without education is not possible and don't be scared you have a brother over there a frame his name is Rama they start give that drama you go and call the drama and Rama will come that happened same story of jutila they depicted in the rama and all oh brother madhu shodhana the young small boy he was going on crying Oh mother shodhana please come again the same thing is happening a child's mind so simple full of fear when the mother estate it must be it can never be something else that fate that's again and again see Ramakrishna is telling childlike faith sometimes some people they are go on some philosophical points I could win see Ramakrishna said we must believe it there should be fate long back when I joined his organization as a brahmacari I was in a treatise Toma one Swamiji came I think he went from America he was here posted here so I was given the responsibility to serve Him so going and cleaning his room giving that drinking water and all the small little things that I used to do and then one day I was sitting with him and talking Sami did this how is this how is this obviously then ultimately we reached to that faith whatever the argument you go on doing there are questions are there always then the wind this thing came about the question of faith then he said I believe in the words of Saddam Oh Krishna that's all there i have anchored and my boat is tired over there I don't move anywhere if no other things are happening no answer I get from the philosophies from the Scriptures I believe in the word of siddhaloka Sheena that's all so the faith faith and faith cinema Krishna is going on and third story he is mentioning as a very very interesting way the master Masha has written as the family deity was there and Abram mean he was leaving he asked his young boy that you must feed the God family deity and see that he has taken food then only you can take food otherwise not the boy offered the food and he was sitting and waiting God will come and God was in the image and he is also waiting there then afterwards he felt hungry but he cannot eat because father told the others the God is coming you cannot God must come God markie then only you can take so the great faith he was sitting and then typically started praying crying if you don't come if you don't take food then how I will take food then the really the God came and took the Prashad and afterwards when it came out of the room and other people saw that there is no fruits and sweets and that some the Hindi word is believing the boy you must have eaten sitting over there it will know God has taken these people they were not believing because the only offer that's all they don't believe the god will take and there are stories in the balloon mud when the direct disciples of ceramic is not they used to offer they will never offer anything that ceramic is not even liked you'll never not only that when they are offering the banana they will see the small little that here like thing is there in the banana that also they will remove so the wind that Cucuy is eating that he should not feel any problem and it disturbed so the wind you are offering the food in such a way as if that man is going to eat most of the people they go and they offer and the cover is already there there is emerging remove the cover and somehow they will show the light and then take away in that fashion and they offer the fruits without cutting without washing the same fruits they will be offering there is no love there is no faith how God can eat a whole the mango or some other fruits if you can you eat can you offer that to a respected person in that way that is the question why no fake and Salaam o Krishna here is giving through these three stories two things faith and intends or and that is the basis of spirituality this is the first type of spirituality and the last step to complete faith and complete yearning so that is the thing he is telling give the offering to the deities and the boys gave and then all this thing happened then afterwards late in the afternoon the Sadam Oh Krishna was talking to master MA chère they were standing on the south side of the Narvik so master mascha describing such a way those who have visited the Dakshina sure the visualize that in the south side of the Narvik they were standing and ceramic kitchen and master measured they were talking since it was winter the master were masters Ramakrishna wrapped in the woollen shawl he was wearing so we can close when you read close the eyes you can visualize the whole thing master see Ramakrishna is asking where will you sleep in the heart or in the Panchavati in the heart in the Panchavati master my he is asking the master ma she is suggesting won't they let me have the room on the upper floor of the Nava if you go to the kanesha there's two in two corner to nobble now what means we're early morning and in the evening time the musicians is to sit and play the music so that was the system so that the people in the distance or the people who are visiting the temple they will have that listen to that music and that atmosphere now it was stopped so just simply the building was left over there still that building is there both of them master master used to prefer to that other different corner and there all alone used to go and stay if you go in even today you'll be so lonely used to go and sit on that now this is a very important thing see ramakrishna is telling the hobart you have selected the novel that is okay Ramakrishna what they will let you have it will not work but I suggested the Panchavati see Ramakrishna already told the temple authority to allow master Masha to live in the heart of the pan charity why because so much contemplation and meditation have been practiced in one place where the contemplation meditation prayer on all spiritual practices have been done that becomes really Searchers with that that helps one if you go and sit in the ceramic isness Ryne in the room Dakshina sure of course so much of people they all go I don't know why they go we must be there having some faith but majority of the people to go as a as a tourist so they do not understand even then if you go and sit over there imagine that Ramakrishna was there sitting on that and all otherwise he is just walking all side here and there you are sitting you're feeling that East wonderful meditation and the feeling when I was very young one night I wanted to spend over there myself and my friend both or I would get went and we are first we were sitting in the that half round that veranda there we were sitting and then we felt sleepy and then we spread it a small the cloth was there exploited and they were sleeping this is a wonderful thing happened some day we may tell you so then the early morning we could go and see the modularity of goddess Kali that the main purpose so this is the way if you go and stay over there and feel that master my shy he is asking that he should like to go to the na wa salam o krishna is suggesting punch ability the participative skills that heart is there but they have made it more comfortable and they're the same name of God has been chanted so often you will wonder today in an hour or two before I was just a same going through my email I received an email from an officer who visited this place and he has written the moment I entered into that place I felt so much of peace I never got that anywhere I am interested to know about this religion who can guide me and how can I contact I have written him to call me anytime or to come and visit exit Exeter who made this is an American it does not know anything of this it came for different purpose to check these are different things are there he is from that department he came to check buriganga G was guiding and showing them he came he passed through that and immediately failed that his mind is not ready for this type of vibration but his mind seeking for peace and the vibration reached we come here we discuss about God we read the holy books we sing over here we meditate we do the evening prayer and morning prayer all the time so the environment that's called tan Matra that tan Matra is very very important and the tan Matra has been created so that helps but to helping to whom and the person also came and he was taking this dog the donation book he's a very strong man he tried to open it he couldn't so he completely lifted the whole heavy box and he was going out there somehow that time our the dome he was here he was working he came he saw him was the matter where you are carrying this now you were thinking I will shift it over there oh no leave it anyway he left it over there then again we put it another person came his purpose was totally different he didn't feel that that vibration so if you have done something a little and yearning for that I want peace I want God I want to have the spiritual life anything something like that whatever way you think the moment you come over here you would feel if you go to some of the temples that not very clean maybe very small not very lighted but inside if you go you will feel but some of the temples are there so neat and clean properly so kept everything super fully you will go and see as if you are in a museum seeing these and that coming out tan Matra done master is very very important that's why inside the temple people are not supposed to read the newspaper or jag something else nothing nothing but God why by that way it such as the environment but if you go and talk in different just any social that's why you feel that puja is going on big big temples but that feeling is not there that is very important here's the Ramakrishna mentioning about that and then ceramic Esna is telling it was evening incense was burning in the Masters room he was sitting on the small couch absorbed in meditation him means master Marshall was sitting on the floor with rock Allah to and Ramallah you can visualize that picture they're all sitting and meditating see Ramakrishna he is telling to master masse the sum and substance of the whole thing is to cultivate devotion for God the sum and substance to cultivate devotion spiritual life now friends I don't understand other things spirituality and the signs these that if ladies carry nothing wrong but when you are sincere seeker for spirituality this is the book this is the guidance or otherwise so many other things that their intellectual things will happen you are just enjoying the reading or that is alright but you are really really interested to utilize your time properly this is the thing so that's way the gospel is very very important then the master asked some other Ramla rumlow was a good singer ever to sing a song rommel was singing all Bengali songs she was singing in that way and cinema Krishna was in inner static mode she was dancing also singing and dancing late at night master Masha sat alone in the north so he went to the novel he sat over there the sky the river the garden the steepness of the temple and the trees and the Panchavati were flooded with the moonlight he was giving the description there's a very good writer too you observed and noted it down deep silence range everywhere broken only by the melodious marveling of the Ganges the wind the flow is going on a sound comes it is so melodious so beautiful even for those who are meditating master ma che was meditating on Sri Ramakrishna so he mentioned over here very clearly is so difficult to understand the person particularly and at the same time same time a same person that we see regularly to accept him as God is so difficult the contemporary person and you are mixing with him talking with him living with him seeing him regularly at the same time you are accepting him as God your Idol meditating on him is really really very difficult master Masha is blessed that's why he could do that and master Marsh I was meditating on the Ramakrishna and then again he is not noting here at 3 o clock in the morning master Masha left his seat he was all through that means he has not mentioned but from the record we can find very you can understand easily after that evening after the thence he left to Salaam Krishna he went over there in sad he meditated and he was enjoying in the nature the quietness and he was meditating on completion of all night at 3 o clock the early morning he left the field and he proceeded toward puncha Verde as the Ramakrishna had suggested that this is also the ramakrishna subject suggested that maybe some problem was there may be that those people who didn't allow him to live into that room there are some other things may be so he went to the Nava the cycles were there and he meditated the whole night and then add to your clock he is going to Panchavati as because see Ramakrishna told this is 3 very interesting there's a God in human form that is very difficult to understand in the bhagavad-gita this we have see you will if you listen to the records that we are studying many times you will find the reputation because the same type of things coming again and again the Salama Krishna the God in the bhagavad-gita we find Veda hamsa ma te kani birth the mana on each Arjuna Viviani to go to Bhutan II mom to be the new question mom to be the na question do people they do not understand me though I understand them this is what about Gita 7 chapter 26 loca Shri Krishna is mentioning that I understand everything I understand be the hamsa ma te Thani all these I know but they do not know me so the contemporary people cannot understand very few thankful waiting four or five if we read the Mahabharata we find only four or five of them they understood Krishna and accepted him as God majority people did they didn't accept him as God a very intelligent person very capable in different things but not as God so that also gives that you have to prepare your mind in such a high then only you can understand God otherwise not in the same rubber teeth and the fourth chapter and he said Oh Joe peas and neva Atma Bhutan army Cheruiyot P Sun broker team swarm of the sky Istanbul army art no Mayan I manifest myself with the help of my own Maya I control my Maya and then I manifest so God can take human form at his free will anytime anywhere so that is the God and Saddam Oh Krishna is the God and master Masha he saved that he was meditating on the ramakrishna and he was falling saddam Acacia the instruction in the Vishnu Purana so he fine we have quoted this again and again would potential bin are some Jeff bhutanam ago team getting besties with Tom of 'adam J sub arches iguana P Betty he knows wisdom and a bit down what is vidya and what is the vidya in the very first chapter see Ramakrishna said to the same master massage the two no one is bigger - no one is bianna and all other things and nothing of India and Salam o Krishna he knew the beginning and the middle and the end would put him in Asha and everything he knew if he cannot be God if he cannot be accepted as God that is bad luck for those who cannot he is God manifested and master Masha is going on writing about his conversation and the story is going on it was Saturday December 15 1883 M had been staying at dictionary with ceramic isne he is continuing the master was sitting in his room listening to the life of pearl Agha what is spirituality spiritual life this thing sometimes singing sometimes meditating sometimes doing the Jabba remembering the name of God some listening that the Holy stories that way is the whole time should pass most of the people after the retirement they do not understand what to do this is the way one should practice so this way one should make his own routine in such a way doing some way if you are capable go and do some work for God and also read the holy books listen and discuss about that go on repeating the name of God the man Kaja / meditating singing and enjoying that song in such a way as if you are in the company of God cinema Krishna is demonstrating when the songs are going on he is dancing great joy so this is the way he is teaching every page we find that how one should develop the spiritual life cinema Krishna is a example every time every moment he is utilizing in wonderful way and he this reading is going on Ramla was reading from the bhakta mala he was sitting on the floor Rahul are two and Harish we're also in the room and Hadera was on the verandah while listening to the story of her Ladas love for God Sadam o Krishna went into a static mode so the mind was so pure so high level the moment I heard that pull others love for God immediately this touching over there so that is the sign of spirituality no one need to kill anything you feel that oneness with those type of devotee the study that we are reading we feel that in Calcutta that all his own disciple ceramic richness desire the great grease Chandra Ghosh he used to have the drama then the lady is also acting that but the society is looked down upon those ladies no one is to go to Dame the question of talking with them keeping any contact with Ramakrishna the holy man she went over there he thought that the play then he wind at the back where those ladies were there he went and blessed them when one lady was crying she played as a chaser numb operable Ramakrishna was moved seeing him are acting in that and then afterwards when he came to meet those that lady was crying and praying oh you holy man please this mean because we are so unworthy and we have lost our life the human life in this way please bless me so that I can get Chaitanya consciousness the consciousness about God the faith about God Serrano Krishna's we did reply you are already Chaitanya why she was playing in the role of much chaitanya mahaprabhu and that time she was thinking that she is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu almost the same fashion almost the same way with the great yearning she was crying and praying to God and singing and dancing see ramakrishna could understand that she has become one with that and that made heart purified once you feel the presence of God within the heart you are purified that's Adamo krishna that not that simply to say oh no you are so Google not like that whatever he thought he saved and whatever he said he thought that Bang Mahna Mahna Shiva Christie Tom who chanted the Sundays that is the same and he said too hard that lady that you are already into that I feel as because she was at a time of that play sincerely thinking that I am Jay dunya she whisked into that condition at least to that moment and that purified her mind that's why Saddam Oh Krishna without hesitation let's start touching her aid so this is the wonderful incident and the story was going on and the master words in an ecstasy of love master mr. Ramakrishna he began to dance about the room and seeing who is singing her his name upon the sacred Ganges Bank it is Nitai they that has come the gebe of heavenly love so they are the bengali song they are thinking singing and ceramic resna was going on dancing see ramakrishna is praying to mother Oh mother makes me like Sita completely forgetful of everything body and limbs and only the one thought in her mind where is Rama the Sita that's why Shama Vivekananda said the cheetah is the representative and ideal of the women all the women should like like Sita why because our one pointed devotion to God that aspect is completely absent the ceramic isne he is talking about that sita make me like sita completely forgetful of everything body and leaves there are two things consciousness and unconsciousness and very closely if we look this body and the mind and all this are unconscious and in these unconsciousness consciousness so if I choose the consciousness that is God and he says where is Rama Rama is a consciousness that is God for a Behrman was the master inspired by the idea love Sita to teach him must immerse he is thinking the yearning that a devotee should feel for God sheeta's very life was centered in Rama completely observed in the thought of Rama Sita forgot even the body which is so dear to all master mazda3 Maud understood the hint and he was taking it in the right way every time as because he was doing lot of spiritual practices his mind was ready so Ramakrishna was removing the other things and guiding him that is the greatest guru the guru who removes the darkness and that darkness in is the ignorance so when the time has come that guru is removing the darkness with great compassion again and again any opportunity is guiding him and asking him to be intently practicing and crying for God love for God faith in God and completely yearning for God forgetting everything including the body so that is what see Ramakrishna said while striving for the realization of God the Spirent has to practice renunciation applying the logic of nadine ET not be is not this but after attaining the vision of god he realizes that God alone has become all things in the beginning he is telling everything nothing I only want drama but after realization of the Rama 1vl I is that everything is nothing but llama but that is the game first is you have to renounce what is the renunciation I and mine the moment I renounce that I and mind is all belongs to me and this is the me and that is the bondage you have to go that's way Ramakrishna's dealing schita is praying Oh God that make me like see the like cheetah completely forgetful of everything body and beams so what is the condition to realize God that intends healing thank you that is chant this phenomena and conclude needin genom nityam onon the loop um popped on a compa Drita Bikram boy yeesh of a column for ameesha medium come Ramakrishna she does on Imam Ashanti chandi Shaundi hurry [Music] that's earth three Zama Krishna I'll eponymous too you
