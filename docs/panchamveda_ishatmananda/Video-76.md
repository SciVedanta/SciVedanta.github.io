top D vanam kobe VI rhythm calm asha pom shravana mangalam srimad otha thumb booby green aunty a gory dodgin ah the very interesting conversation was going on and ceramic rishni was explaining the condition of different type of minds and he said that the main cause of suffering is greed and according to dad there are different type of jebus the human being but their stages are different so he gave the name like but the jiva but the means he is actually bound souls bound in what bound in this worldliness and what is this worldliness again and again rotating in the circle of birth and death and from our experience we can understand this is very painful the sometimes we enjoy by most of the time we suffer but we cannot understand how to get rid of the suffering so the the brilliant minds the Rishi's the sages the avatara's they have discovered these and they say that because of your greed to enjoy this worldly life you are bound to shall we not enjoy the worldly life then as because we are born as because we have some responsibilities as because we have some mind thinking what to do all cannot become zania since all cannot even after becoming sannyasins there are many were thinking about the samsara is the mind only is not the clothings or the environment or the other things so he is suggesting the true religion why human being should practice religion because to go beyond this circle and this is called bound Souls and we have discussed about this bound Souls very very worldly type of people they only know about themselves they only think about themselves they are only want to get the attention so like these these are all bound Souls and sometimes we go to different places for some functions if there is any so-called known people or maybe a political personality you know to get a picture with him or hard there will be people will be coming rushing and somehow pushing so that way they show that they are so eager to get a picture with that person what after that so this is they always show like that anything that something is going on they like to be the first depriving the others not caring about others not thinking about others why because the desire desire for what to be someone someone in what seems so this is the questions that we have to ask again and again and today we will read that is why this is the book of knowledge and this teaches us the life how to live a happy life so there it is Pancham aveda i called it named it as punch em aveda cause it gives us the knowledge and Veda means knowledge then there are another type of people at there who are free Souls and these free Souls of course they are not bound by this desire why they come then just to teach us as an example they'll be leaving there will be there in front of us they are leaving so that we can learn so that we can at least imagine that this is a way one person can leave they are giving the example only but they are not bound and that type of people are also here in this world it's called Mukti Jeeva are the free Souls and again there are Nietzsche cydia need to sit there ever perfect the free Souls but this is our all ever perfect this muck toshiba they under their own you know they they have controlled their senses and they have withdrawn their senses and they have realized the truth and they are free so they are leaving as an example before us that they were also like this condition and somehow just with their strong wield power they have reached to that point though all the great souls that we see we can learn from them st. Francis of Assisi is a beautiful life we if we read his biography is a Christian Saint and how he is leaving how he is controlling his passions his mind the excellent way so that is there's call Mauch toshiba they get freedom from the bondage and there is another neat to see the ever perfect they are not bound at all and they are about Aras like Jake tandem operable stall this Swami Vivekananda they need to sit there but whole life that they leave only to show the human be and nothing else when you see that this is possible in one man's life and we get inspiration it is possible for me to saudia Neath the there and other is sadhanas a decree pass it there they are perfect Souls sadhana sit there and keep our sit there some amok show that is what we are that muumuu kuta we are also trying to realize the truth though a group of devotees came today and we were discussing nowadays not many people are coming even in the weekdays also and they SAT and they were discussing and they were telling that what is good ritual or meditation I took both are necessary rituals are also necessary and at the same time meditation but for both one thing is common discrimination which swami rama krishna is speaking about again and again discriminate discriminate discriminate this discrimination means you have to understand what you are doing why you are doing what you are doing why you are doing now i am serving food i know i am serving food but i don't know why i am serving food that is the question that we will be going this weekend for a retreat and you will be discussing the Swami will be coming tomorrow nuh day after tomorrow and you will be discussing on karma yoga and what is the Karma the action that we are doing and that is Ramakrishna is telling that you must discriminate and then only you will get the grace of God blessings of God and you will get peace people come here again and again I do not know anything but people are coming why from faraway places they are coming why tormenting the successful people very excellent in education they are successful India mentally live but something they are not getting that's called peace and they are coming and opening up their mind they want peace how to get peace the discrimination the discrimination is bichara this is very essential after achieving all those things if I cannot sleep happily if I don't have any friends nearby if I don't have anyone with whom I can talk and when I am sitting alone my mind is at peace then what is the use of this life constantly struggling struggling and struggling and suffering and somehow engaged in spending time is that the life all these are the question we have to ask I have done my duty that is the answer whatever duty was given to me in whatever position I was aya perfectly perform as a child I have done my duty to my parents as a husband or a wife I have done my duties as some responsible person some society I have done my duties as a father I have done my duties like that you have to take the stock and then you can in conclusion whatever has happened in between that is I am not affected by that because I have performed my duty perfectly as per my capacity all are not perfect but according to the capacity I have done so that is that there comes the satisfaction the Sun tozhe and the moment the santosha will come there is no the in the in the mind will be no doubt at all the ceramic ISNA is the ring that you have to love God and we read the last time that but the eva mock cagiva then Nita giba and capacitors ardency do all the stages of different type of minds and there comes Manu kuta muy mucho Chiba were striving to reach is that a professor in the class and the student in the class the professor is already cydia is perfected and he is not going to sit for any examination so there is no fear for him but the student is learning a moo moo shu but in the life of mamata there is lot of hurdles examinations and we have to cross that we have to pass that how we can do that then see Ramakrishna said sadhu sanga again and again neogen bars whenever you get an opportunity go alone somewhere and then not down study your mind newgen bars and develop love and attachment for God and the love again there are three different types it says sodhani means general Soderini love for only personal benefit I love because for my personal benefit I am doing that showing my love showing my respects doing everything all my thinking circle ground for my personal benefit so the that type of love is nothing but selfish love then summon jossa there are many people who will be taking the orphan boys and girls and they will help them to grow so that they can earn some money not of course not giving them much of education and all that but they feed them they give them shelter so the wind grew up they will go out and earn money for them they are showing the love that orphan boys when he will grow up he will say at least this man to care so I am leaving there is a love but love for purely selfish motive that is called sod arone love then summon Jessa well I love myself at the same time I like to help others also so the both are there usually we have the same we majority of the people are having sodhani love the solder sorry summer sorry someone just Allah this summon Jessa mean such a means love for myself and at the same time I am taking care and loving others because I loved them too but myself is attitude is still there this is sam and Jessa and then comes the final the highest love is called samartha this samartha labs highest love only caring for others that is called samartha what is this karma yoga actually swami vivekananda stirring through unselfish work and we have to remember those words through unselfish work one can reach to the same goal where buddha reached by his knowledge Christ by his prayer through the path of knowledge to the path of love devotion this Christ and the Bhagavad good the dearest dear one person just by helping working for others can also go over there reach over there get that position but through unselfish work unselfish work means samartha this is very very important one swami ji was there bon VRE baba this van very guava he's to take care of the patients in our Hospital ramakrishna mission hospital in kashi Banaras and his work was to go and see the sick people not just simply giving medicine but by carrying their homes and you know in that time and now also these people are not very careful the villagers when they come and sometimes from their body the bad smell is coming up and so much so the doctors refused to go buttburn maryville i used to go and to clean the tone and giving them the bandage talking with them so nicely so that they won't feel pain while this medicine is applying and that way he continued why because his guru said go and serve the Living Shiva the leaving Shiva they're all you go to the temple to see the Sheba in Banaras here the leaving Shiva then when Mary bhava people started thinking and respecting him as a leaving Shiva himself when the others young stuff stays to go and talk to him the swami ji how can you go inside so bad smell and this to close their nose and covering the face this to go there but he said but i don't get any bad smell because they are my gods they have come there full with beautiful fragrance God cannot smell bad think of it and that is called some earth Allah we cannot think of I visited that hospital they took me I tell you my god is not my job it I won't be able to do it but he did it the karma yogi so true karma one can reach to the same goal and when he was very old his to inquire about how many of the patients have come then one young brahma cherry was injured that job he told today three patients have been admitted he said again asked what you say three bedrooms amici then again he asked he thought that he is not hearing it properly so he shouted three patients like that then he started crying look at this boy he sees the patients he can't you see the gods then the others when he was crying than others told Swamiji he's very new he has come here joined here very new is a novice slowly he will learn so he is telling like that you are not supposed to tell them as patients in my gods can you imagine can anyone think in this way there are millions of doctors how many of them will think in this way when if some person is coming and you are treating at the same time in the feeling is is my god no he cannot think and result you're bound result we are suffering result we are criticizing others and telling see these people are not helping God is not helping God is already helping only thing we do not understand the secret of work whatever you do that when we re baba what he did only nursing millions are doing it regularly every time to what is the difference attitude so that attitude is a cigarette of karma yoga and that attitude comes only through love and that to the highest love without caring what I am going to get that is called samartha now ceramic ISNA is the conversation turned to the spiritual zeal of devotees as illustrated in the earnestness of the gopis of brindaban Ramlal as a that he used to take care of raghavan see Ramakrishna he was related also he he was a very good singer he started singing thou art my all in all Oh Lord the life of my life the essence of essence in the three worlds I have none else but D to call my all the call my own is only one that is God the most of the people of course that is general questions the show me how you leave all alone and you will see their own father mother we all family we are leaving their words the family in either sitting over here every day you have to feed them here to take care of them and clean them not lame everything you have to do as we do to the father's they'll be sitting so we come and talk to them and that is the prayer when you talk to them there's a prayer so that is the feeling that God is there always with me who's it I am alone is a wonderful way of fulfilling the heart no loneliness always you are with someone and that is your god no loneliness in the modern life that is the punishment loneliness but if a person can turn that mind that I am always with someone talking with him caring for him and anything very good immediately collecting to give a gift to that person because my only beloved is that my god and it says that thou art my all in all and ceramic is na what a beautiful song thou art my all in all see if one can think in that way then only the all misery vanishes why the misery we cannot think in that way so obviously when they were we are thinking I today I was reading in a newspaper an excellent son he is here in America somewhere so I was thinking that if they could give that address I could go and meet and at least congratulate him because he is the example of worldliness what he did that fellow is here he has completed as per the report I don't know as per the report he has completed his education everything and father went on giving the money giving the money giving the money then he afterwards settled over here he started hardening but still he went on pressurizing the father give me money I like to start a business then ultimately the father denied no we have only this building where you are going to leave but he was going on constantly pressurizing the old man somehow could not died and when the father died this fellow went to their to attain to the final rites and then afterwards told his mother what you are going to do alone over here come with me mother was not willing but the other relatives told is good that you go you will be with your son what you are going to do alone over here in India so ultimately she agreed then that boy took all the property sold it including the building took all the jewelry's money in his own hand but choose a passport and visa was made he took the mother to the airport and he said please be here and I am going to bring some food for you and he never came back and the mother not knowing anything she was sitting over there while through the International Airport he lived for America and the mother was sitting over there in the domestic airport mother never knew actually the son his her own son so naturally believing the own son sitting over there waiting Thane she started crying then the local people that came in credit office as they incurred foolish was informed foolish took heart then other there are some groups of people are there were taking for the special care for the elderly people then is it was flashed in the newspaper but they could not get any information about her son see the mother's love she told anyway he is my son if I complain to poolish then the police will arrest him eres him but he is my son good or bad my son and ultimately I am going to die at today or tomorrow let me die in this way let him get all this he was supposed to get maybe after view days now he has taken away littler see the mother's heart the love for the child up for the Sun and look at this son and he is called that is sri ramakrishna told they are some sorry the samsara means this only think about himself not even about the mother and father and he has forgotten that he is going to die someday here the mastery oh wat and then the master is telling Ramlal sang again hold not hold nord the chariots will and when the accrued whant to take the krishna from brindavan to my father plays mathura i think and then all these copies they came and they were holding the will of the chariot then the up crew was telling them why you are holding the carriers will do you think it moves out of his own it is the krishna was sitting over here because of his will so that way that means you have to understand these are the things happen and here again the master is the link thou master went into deep Samadhi his body was motionless he SAT with folded hands as in his photograph tears of joy flowed from the corners of his eyes after a long time his mind came down to the ordinary plane of consciousness and he said he was saying thou art I and I am dau that devotion he is talking about then he said o Krishna the friend of the lowly o eternal concert of my soul o Govinda as he uttered the words eternal concert of my soul Govinda he went again into Samadhi there was complete silence in the in the room the eager and unsatisfied eyes of the devotees where on the master a god man of infinite moons now he is talking in this way and suddenly he is in that then one person came his name was utter shame he was he came with some of his several of his frames he was a deputy magistrate about 30 years old and then he is telling he was accompanied by his friend sorrow Darin was extremely unhappy because of the death of his son a retired deputy inspector of schools Tsarevich aaron and his mind was afflicted state of mind that coming down from the samadhi master found the eyes of devotees fixed on him now the master Masha noting that one devotee is coming he was the deputy magistrate in those days at the time of the British errs those elderly Indians can understand to become a magistrate and deputy magistrate at the time of the British regime that means water when efficiency was necessary so he became that deputy magistrate he was very good person he became the devotee of ceramic ISNA used to come and today he has come with his friend who lost his son so he wanted to get the count some words from see Ramakrishna see Ramakrishna was talking immediately with high spiritual values cinema Krishna says the spiritual wisdom of worldly people is seen only on rare occasions he was still thinking on that and then he is coming out and he has come down from the samadhi and he is not looking what is happening around he is telling to the people but in a very high state of mind it is like the flame of a candle no it is rather like a single ray of the son passing through a in a wall worldly people chant the name of God but there is no still behind it so that very clearly he is mentioning thousands of people in one place they will be a good but there is no Zille why they're chanting what they are chanting what is the meaning of it after chanting what I am going to get now nothing is there so TC is very important to learn spirituality we must be careful and constantly thinking what we are doing why we are doing man reaps the harvest of his own past actions and he started singing explaining his view Oh mother I have no one else to blame alas I sink in the well this very hands have dark I myself have created these and I am suffering I and mine that is ignorance now he is giving ceremony schnaa just he was talking about the devotion of the gopis and he went into Samadhi suddenly now he is changing too pure advait him and he said I and mine that is ignorance by discriminating you will realize that what you call I is really nothing but artman reason it out are you the body of the flesh or something else at the end you will know that you are none of these you are free from attributes attributes means the name and the other degrees and all these so there is called attributes then you will realize that you have never being the doer of any action that you have been free from virtue and faults alike that you are beyond righteousness and unrighteousness the think of the advaitha that he was speaking the moment we are discriminating then we can understand what I am talking about Who am I all these things that you are imposing on me to call pass away then didn't Prime Minister of India atoll very much kg he came to Andaman and he came to inaugurate one of our two of our buildings and the naturally the people the supporters of that political group they were shouting at LG jinda bad at all geometry a and the autumn amara he means let him be permanent like that then at OG ask them like this and they went near the microphone and said this at LG will die someday this ought algae may not be Prime Minister next day but deep the joy to show me t Swami Vivekananda Swami G he is eternal see the discrimination he was not people are shouting for his favor but in his favor but he was thinking in the right direction discrimination then and there and he told I am a very ordinary person but the grace of God only today I am Prime Minister of India but I may not be tomorrow but this Swami g will remain swami ji is just like the Sun this is the discrimination God is there every time and if i discriminate then i am not touched by anything the physical ailments and all of the things there is only temporary and it is only going away so that he was and he was telling that i just remembered that as vagabond see Rama Krishna is teaching us if you discriminate then you will see that it is only we think that we are suffering otherwise there is nothing constantly if I can realize that I am NOT his bones I am NOT this flesh I am NOT the name that I have got to this body I am something which is beyond this I am not touched by anything wonderful joy will come so that it sends and he says reasoning stops when God when one sees God but there are instances of people who have realized God and who still continue to reason even after that they are reasoning because to keep their mind alert again there are people who even after having seen God chant his name with devotion and sing his glories how long does a child cry then immediately as his sim the speciality is giving the example how long does a child cry so long as it is not sucking at his mother's breast as soon as it is narced it stops crying then the child fields only joy and joyously it drinks the milk but it is also true that while drinking child sometimes plays and loves so how these giving the example is just now the child is in the good care of the mother and the child is in great joy but still sometimes you will play sometimes smile so like that it is God alone who has become everything but in man his manifest himself the most the man has created out of God's own image even in the Bible it says so that is the highest the girl and stronger Acharya he said against and I went to the Providence and I was giving the retreat on BB catcher Romany and the very second look of the BBH Romany is this jen to nom nirajan ma doula vomita the knowledge and mother human birth is very very rare gentoo nom the souls the lives and deer getting this narayana human bird is really very special and cinema krishna is telling it is God alone who has become everything but in man he manifest himself the most in man why it can discriminate it can directs his mind on the higher things no animal will look at the sky what is only the human being and they appreciate the nature they can have imagined they can visualize more higher things than they are so that is the capacity that the God has given to the human being he manifest himself the most God is directly present in the man who has the pure heart of a child and who loves and cries and dance and things in divine ecstasy so this is the glory of the human life and then if we lose it it is a great loss that he is reminding us that we must remember it is the human birth is very precious God is present within us and we are nothing but God's only thing we have to remember it and remember it every moment and particularly the time of death now this time see Ramakrishna had become better acquainted with other and who related the case of his friends grief the moment he was telling about these my son has lost my friend has lost his son immediately see ramakrishna sang a beautiful song and it is is discovering in this way to arms to arms oh man did storms your house in battle larry bearing the quiver of knowledge mount the chariot of devotion bent the bow of your tongue with the bow string of love and aim at him the shaft of mother Callie's holy name here is the rush of the ferry you need no chariot or charioteer fight your foe from the Ganges bank he is easily slain when the date is coming then standing on a holy place taking the name of God if you are accepting the death then you can defeat the depth that is a very special death actually enjoys when we are afraid of death but when a human being has already conquered the mind then the death is defeated then he said what can you do be ready for depth look at it when the people they think about it and they are afraid you don't like to listen to it but that is the truth and this truth is one that nobody can avoid what can you do be ready for death death has entered the house you must fight him with the weapons of God's Holy Name we can fight the date with the God's holy name one lady there's a famous story in the life of vagabond Buddha the mother she carried her dead child to Buddha and she was crying and begging you are a great soul people say like that please bring life back to in my son's body I want him leaving and good they immediately understood that it is impossible at this moment to pacify her telling the truth and in a wonderful way he said mother you go to these houses in the neighborhood every house you go and ask only one question has anybody in your family died if not then bring one that little mortal a little what's called the master seed oil see it and I will bring back the life to your son she went and knocked the door of each and every house but every house told her that someone has died in the presently your past there was not a single house where there is no story of depth then she understood came back and told of Buddha I have understood the truth and she became afterwards a nun and this is the truth the date is going to come and see Ramakrishna he is asking us that you must fight him with the weapon of God's Holy Name the way we are going on repeating the name of God and the body is going away his body only going away I am going to go to God and we find in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna is promising and in the eighth chapter he says untok ali shah mom eva smaran Amata kalavaram you priority sir madhavaram yachty Nast etre some Shia there is no doubt that should not be any doubt that that person is coming to me who at the time of death could remember me on to cali at the time of death mam eva smaran amok talk kalavaram kalavaram is the body when muktha coming out of the body that soul taking my name pre RT passed away some mother babam yachty he gets my person who can say he goes to me at in my state and there is no doubt again he said yum yum bop is marana homam desert ENT kalavaram in this next sloka the 8th chapter as a six loci he said young young boppy smaran bhavam taja tea auntie kalavaram Tom Tom ebit con te Siddhartha vivaha Vita ha whatever object person things and at the time of death he gets that object in the first loca he said if you possibly thinking about me you are going to get me achieve me and he will come to me the god but at the second time he said suppose you are not whatever object you will be thinking you will get that in the chin d we find the two persons they're worshiping Goddess Durga one is a kinky law who lost his kingdom another is a businessman who lost his business the boat they came in the jungle and then if they met a Rishi and then when they were asked to watch perform Durga Puja they did then after when the mother came Divine Mother then the king he prayed to the mother I want to become a king that we I must have a bigger kingdom and he got that but the businessmen told know enough of those things i want to go to you the young young babam whatever object you are thinking you are getting and similarly one who is giving away the body thinking me he will get me so this is the gita shri krishna is promising but can one think of god at the time of death that is the million-dollar question why because constantly we are thinking something else how at that time we can expect the thought of God will come to us and that is the reason see Rama Krishna is telling you must prepare yourself at the weapon is the Lord's name prepare yourself with the weapon of lords name so that when the god is coming in the form of death you can defeat that God without fear because you know i am repeating the name of God and nothing wrong bad is going to happen to me body may suffer it doesn't matter but my mind always enjoy that one show me his he was the president of there is a direct disciple of cinema Krishna and he became the president of the Ramakrishna order Swami Sivananda and he had asthma trouble it is so difficult to take the breathing you know even in the morning also when you got up from the bed used to hold a pillow and somehow used to seat when the show me is and the Brahma char is this to go to pay respect to the President to the Honorable Swamiji how many of them these to us Swamiji how are you his answer always the body is suffering but I am happy can you imagine that is muktha he is not getting the suffering at all when the suffering is suffering when mind is a test with the suffering when the mind is not a test with the suffering then who can give me the suffering so that's why see ramakrishna is teaching us give your power of attorney to God one doesn't come to grieve through letting a good man assume wants responsibilities let his will be done I give everything to you my god now it is your responsibility to keep me either in suffering or enjoy whatever way you like I am ready to enjoy God is engaged in three kinds of activities ceramic asian is explaining creation preservation and destruction so then what remains is everything God is doing creation he created and he is preserving nursing at the same time he himself is destroying that these see Ramakrishna a great mystic he saw these while he was meditating under the banyan tree at the bank of the Ganga destination he saw the one beautiful lady she came out from the Ganges and she became pregnant she gave birth of a child and she was nursing then suddenly she took a terrible form and took away the child within herself and vanished so creation reservation and destruction if you can understand these why we are afraid oh I created this building this building why building the whole universe is going to destroy some day so obviously you are free that particular time I have enjoyed leaving I had a nice house I had a nice family had a nice car I have visited all the places of all these things I have done in my life at a time of death okay I am done I'm going and where you are going I'm going to God because all the time all through I was remembering him and he has promised in the bhagavad-gita the Wayne if i can remember at the time of death you will be taking care of me i am sure i am going to take his name so if that conviction is there the love is there complete faith is there and as salam o Krishna stealing giving away all to that God then even enjoying in this life I can be at the God so he is stealing God is engaged in three things death is inevitable all will be destroyed at the time of dissolution nothing will remain at the time the divine model will gather up the seeds for the future creation for the future creation she will all gather up the seeds what are those seeds our past Karma's is never going to be destroyed so one is planning at the time of destruction in the Christianity and everywhere there is a sense of this the last day of this creation so anything something happening and most of the time in medieval period people who are ignorant anything happening some earthquake and some people will come and they'll beat the drum Oh the last day has come last day of judgment so get ready get ready then there's nothing happened only thing he was only shouting he group the voice so there's a what where is the last day we do not know in the last day is going to come but it is going to come some day I don't bother about that because before the last day comes we will be circling round many many many times because of our desire and now we know the last day is going to come either today or tomorrow or maybe millions and millions of years after doesn't matter I am ready that is a calculative man saw cha 3 g.r three some people are very intelligent resolve what that intelligence only cheating others and getting some money no such are 3 g.r three that is the real sense of intelligence that he knows I don't have much time in my life I must try to prepare so he goes on taking the name of God everywhere every moment every time and the same time performing all these responsibilities his duties perfectly what happens good result accumulating good results and at the time of these then the mother god divine mother epic that soul and put in there very nice place and that is the feet of the lord or in the Earthmen Marge's in the Earthman so that's why I ramakrishna is telling to other you are a deputy magistrate now salam o Krishna is asking this man you are a deputy magistrate because in a very big post remember that you have obtained your position through the grace of God so don't be feeling that ego that I have done it I have done it there's some people the right there laters doctorate so they will put the dr in capital so you should not means that i am a yeah say the doctor and see this is good okay but who gave you the intelligence that intellect God and that one should be humble before God because of that only I have become these he is telling your deputy magistrate remember that you have obtained your position through the grace of God do not forget him but remember that all men must one day walk down the same path we stay in the world only a couple of days and afterwards the writer giving the footnote and cinema Krishna told this other Shane all these and after 18 months he passed away after 18 months that means one year I have one and half in here he passed away the cinema Krishna is making his mind read Because used to love that person very much and other saying is to come and then opening up you know the very summertime in a hot country he used to open the gown and all those things the government official dress and used to sleep nicely on the floor of Ramakrishna other people is to come and wonder why this man is sleeping over here people come here to talk to you to listen to you salam o Keesh news to say no don't disturb him let him sleep quadri can't sleep so much a problem in his mind so late him sleep nicely as a child sleeps on the lap of the model little sleep and slowly slowly ceramic ich nur was preparing the mind of the other scene and today we read and the master Mercia gives the comment here that do not forget him he means the god h capital do not forget him but remember that all men must go one day walk down the same path of death we stay in the world only a couple of days this world is our field of activity this world is our field of activity we are born here to perform certain duties people have their homes in the country but come to calculate to work like that here again he is giving the example people they go to the downtown they work over there then rushed back if it is a friday evening my god as fast as possible they'll be driving why they like to go to the home and do not forget our home is the abode of God moon chala me Jenna katani we have to go back to her own aboard and it is necessary to do a certain amount of work this is a kind of discipline but one must finish it speedily while melting gold the Goldsmith uses everything so let us stop over here and the next day again we will study the wonderful words above juan serrano krishna if only people at the patience to read and listen and there is no barrier that only Hindus are the Muslims the Christians now no no we're here it is beyond all the value is only the words of wisdom whoever will listen and try to practice even a little they'll get the benefit of it and that benefit is nothing bar that benefit is fearlessness and eternal joy and that is assured let us chant this pranaam mantra and concluded need engine an idiom anantara phone bak tonneau compa Drita Bikram be ye shabe taram para Misha medium Tom ramakrishnan she'd asana mama Oh Sean
