[249: Panchama Veda 249 : God Belongs to All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pGqJKSTGEk)

namaskar good evening dear devotees and friends today is wednesday and we will study the gospel of siram krishna which i prefer to say panchama veda so let us begin [Music] a the last wednesday we discussed on the inner feeling of sri ramakrishna is there very interesting just the name inner feeling what he thinks on which particular things ramakrishna is giving so much of importance and that is krishna said the god is the doer the god is doing everything that is the it says that is my inner feeling the last weekend last wednesday we discussed that the god is doing everything see if we really can think in that way so we are depending on the god not only as a faith in god faith in the existence of god but completely depending on god and by that way we are completely eradicating our ego the god and the human being difference only ego so when the ego is in between this god and the devotee the devotee cannot realize god cannot see god and that the moment we are depending on god but it's not so easy that's why it's ramakrishna is telling my inner feeling i am feeling if people could think in this way and he gave so many references like a small baby and constantly on the lap of the mother they will care what is happening all around the world the baby is completely depending on the mother mother knows what what she should do and when she should do how she should do baby is not at all but can we take that position of a baby no why because we have the ego anything anyone is trying to do for us immediately we'll say can you not do it like this it is better to do in this way why because ego i have my and the god slowly slowly goes away when a child is growing up i am giving an another example when is a baby on the lap of the mother don't give any idea or not having his personal thing mother takes care when the wind that baby is growing up slowly slowly i want that i should eat this and i should go over there mother slowly withdraws isn't it same way the god is also separating from us because of the ego so sirama krishna said completely ego free that was the last week we were discussing the one point of sirama krishna's teaching is depend on god but that is not so easy but our goal should be on that and today we will come to this the god is everywhere god belongs to all god is everywhere belongs to all friends let us begin with this we were discussing about that conversation that master masha has recorded when suramar krishna was visiting the sithi brahma samaj we are slowly reading and going on discussing analyzing trying to understand so the slow reading and this is the page that 633 the last para sirama krishna you have already read it but still i'm reading again bhagavan sinama krishna is mentioning three words master teacher and father prick me like thorns so for whom he is telling but those who are claiming that they are the teachers and they think that they will guide the people for them master teacher and father i am the son of god the eternal child how can i be a father god alone is the mother and i am his instrument he is the operator and i am the machine at the continuation of my inner feeling if somebody addresses me as guru i say to him go away you fool how can i be a teacher islamic krishna is telling this to teach us even the master master when he came to meet ramakrishna not even a week or so one or two visits and master masha told to suramar krishna shall we not go and tell people that god is not belonging in the and krishna rebuked him you have not realized anything you have not heard uh known anything and immediately like to go and teach you like to give the lecture this is the defect of you people suramar krishna said why the most of us we like to teach others the one the lady came and she was telling the what are the functions i told these are the things that mostly we give the we read the scripture we try to explain so that is the major activity over here can i come and teach people because i have already realized god then i told that would have been very good but the problem is it is only about our devotees they come only to listen to the xiaomi belonging to disorder and sometimes so i don't think we'll be able to invite you over here so if i have already realized god i really need the people's appreciation and attention but i am hypnotized with my own thoughts that is the problem in the spiritual life most of the people they think that they have already realized they are practicing a little and immediately see i said that and immediately it was happened i thought and this happened this is a short of a hypnotizing and that is dangerous in the spiritual life suramar krishna therefore the person like sunam krishna the god himself he is telling if somebody address me as guru i say to him go away he alone is the fairy man to take one across the ocean of the world so the our whole attention should go to god the all-powerful all merciful all pervading that consciousness this moment we are not understanding this moment our intellect cannot grasp that but we can believe in the words of the personalities like suramar krishna and the other avatars so god is there he's telling to be joy it is very difficult to act as an acharya krishna at that time when sudama krishna is talking with him he was with the brahma-samaj and brahma-samaj they is to have the acharya who will be teaching will be guiding them so naturally it is also necessary for organized religion that somebody should be there to perform so the other people can follow but one who is doing that the acharya is very difficult it harms the acharya himself finding a number of main doing him reverence he sits erect crossing his leg and says proudly i am preaching hear e all the sudama krishna he is using the biblical language e all you all instead so that proudness the pride that comes this passage particularly those who are giving the teachings one young lady she was coming from india to america i was also in the same flight and she was very happy and proudly telling i am an acharya i am teaching people and you're very good now these are all the people don't understand what is the archery means what just they'll be expounding because they know the language as having the command over the language and they read that immediately it is not like a philosopher or a professor in the college and school not like that it's a practice that you are practicing yourself and feeling and realizing then only you can share it with others and that too if you get the permission from inner self it will come so this is the way one should i am preaching here you all this is very bad attitude so surama krishna is teaching us he gets a little prestige and it ends there people will say it at most ah bijay babu has spoken very well he knows a great deal and never cherries the attitude i am preaching i always say to the divine mother o mother thou art the operator and i am the machine that's why shiramakrishnan says this is my inner feeling always depending on mother always depending on god always thinking that on behalf of the mother i'm just announcing sometimes the emperors the kings they will not announce their order they'll be people the ministers particularly they'll be announcing the order of the king it is like us so we we are only saying those things it is not that we are telling it is cerama krishna's words but we are sitting together and reading and discussing that's all and trying to understand again and again when we hear these then only because the ego is so strong it's very difficult to break even forget about the evolutions of the ego we have to break the ego how hearing these words of sirama krishna i can never become guru i can never become a preacher unless and until i have realized god so that is exactly what suramar krishna is telling the neighbor cherished attitude i am preaching i always say to the divine mother mother thou art the operator and i am the machine i do as thou makest me do i speak as thou makest me speak this was demonstrated in the life of swami vivekananda when he was here in america and almost every day he used to deliver eight to ten lectures and you can imagine before the audience who never heard of india forget about hinduism we never heard of the anything of the indian tradition indian religion indian philosophy and he is convincing them teaching them making them feeling them in such a way that they're understanding it it's so difficult so slowly slowly he was thinking what i'm going to speak next day you know there are some people they have recorded in their memoirs but they could hear the swami vivekananda the whole night when he's sleeping he's going on delivering lectures he's talking next day morning when they are swamiji with whom you were talking i didn't talk i was sleeping but actually sirama krishna made him practice that he was speaking through vivekananda and that is exactly what suramar krishna is telling you are the operator and i am the machine i don't do anything the swami vivekananda was completely dedicated completely dependent on sirama krishna and sirama krishna was speaking through him the goddess kali was speaking through srama krishna and sudama krishna is speaking through swami vivekananda so that is when he is telling it has been demonstrated in the life of his beloved disciple then bijay very harmly please give me your permission only then i will sit on the platform the acharya that you that was the tradition of the brahmas that acharya will be on a higher platform naturally everywhere and then he will speak and he will give the the dick terms and then he'll it's quote from the scripture except people will listen and sometimes they were having some of the prayers they used to pray master with the smile what shall i say because sirama krishna he was a different he was a worshipper of goddess kali and the bijay krishna gosvami belonged to the brahma-samaj and bhamusha was never accepted goddess kali or any image of god or goddesses when the bijay is asking before everyone so how can i say pray to god yourself he belongs to all that is god belongs to all pray to god then he said even as uncle moon is the uncle of all children you have nothing to fear if you are sincere now there's a footnote in the book it says in the folklore of bengal the moon is often pointed out to the children as their maternal uncle the children they very much like to go to the father's house of the mother that's called maternal uncle's house so that they when they go the mother's brother is the maternal uncle so they love him because you know children they get all facilities from that affection they forgive to so they like so sometimes they used to say the moon is the maternal uncle chad mama in bengali they say so he is telling like that the god is the maternal uncle of all you can pray to him then the on being further requested by bijay the master said yes go follow the rules everything is all right if one has sincere love for god because bijay krishna gosvami was feeling hesitant to speak before bhagavan sirama krishna and when you are in the position of an arch area you have to instruct people to do these do that sometimes it becomes very difficult when suramar krishna is sitting over there so he took the permission and sudama krishna was happy bijay sat on the platform and conducted the worship according to the rules of the brahma-samaj at the time for the prayer he repeatedly called on the mother touching the hearts of all so this is new introductions ramakrishna's influence the they separated from hinduism not separated but that way a group came and because they were confused whether god can be in that form in an image in an uh picture so that was the main debate the main problem is because the missionaries they used to say a group of people the god is all pervading how god can be in the image there's a completely wrong conception the wind is to thinking that we're talking that way the educated indians the then educated indians they were educated mainly in the western way of education they also lost their hopes and they were thinking it is better that if we can get converted into christianity or what we can do at least we can have another parallel way where hinduism will be practiced but without the form and that was the brahma-samaj there's a prathana samaj then arya samaj like that there are so many samaj the groups of people they came up they were all hindu but they wanted to belong to hindu with a little alteration and here we find the bijay he is praying to that brahman as mother and now touching the hearts all after the worship their host entered entertained the master and the devotees with the sumptuous feast soon they were ready to return home srama krishna became engaged in conversation with bijay and bijay alone only master mashay was was there sadama krishna you prayed to god addressing him as mother that is very good people say that the mother's attachment to the child is stronger than the father's a son can force his demand on his mother but not on his father so this is the way sirama krishna was teaching and slowly slowly these people those who were thinking that they are separated from the hinduism they were turning back particularly bijay krishna gosvami then many others were there and then some of the teachers they didn't like it so once when suramar krishna went to see the sadharan brahma samaj is near tantana kali body and he wanted to but he wanted to see and meet not in or not not in the didn't visit him for a long time so he went over there to meet but the moment the acharyas they saw the ramakrishna is entering still that building is there the entering into that they immediately put up the all lights it became very dirt and people so naturally wanted to rush out of the hall narendra the young man he was sitting on the dice he was a very good singer so everywhere they used to call him to sing the songs he noticed sirama krishna and he jumped from there ran and somehow saved him from falling because the people were rushing out and then like a son to his father said why have you come over here the surama krishna told why you didn't visit dakshinesha for a long time i came to see you but that is the love that that sudama krishna was having the affections ramakrishna was having but the narendra not but the look at these people they are educated people cultured people the moment suramar krishna was entering they thought he's so popular if he comes over here all people listen to him and our teachings it only the people on take so this was the one from one scene we can understand some people were not liking suramar krishna to go and visit their assemblies but some of them keshav chandrashen vijaya krishna gosvami who were the founders of the sadharan brahma samaj they were slowly slowly improving themselves sudan krishna never said that you need not to follow this path he only said if you think god as mother your feelings for god will be more strong and that relationship the god is my mother will give you a force you can demand on mother but it's very difficult to demand on the father you can go and fight with the mother you can cry you can insist that is exactly what sirama krishna is telling bijay if brahman is our mother then has it any form or is it formless see that thought is constantly haunting these people if the brahman is our mother because that is the main reason they were coming out of the traditional hinduism hinduism accepts all god with form without form which form that helps people ordinary people and without form it is very difficult to consider it all depends on the mind the mind has to be concentrated mind has to be focused and where i will focus my mind if there is nothing is it possible for the ordinary people to focus on the mind on nothing so obviously the hindus they developed this the brahmana rupa kalpana they knew the brahman cannot have the form but the kalpana why bhakthanam anukam partham for the betterment for the we can say the affection on kanpa the that is they're trying to help the god is trying to help the brahman is trying to help these people to come to him so this conception of that's why in the hinduism there are so many varieties of forms unlimited you can think god in any form you like and that is the reason if they were was so serious they would have given these are the two three forms that you are supposed to worship otherwise not but no anyone can worship god in any form sometimes goddess durga will be ten hands sometimes six hands any form you like sadama krishna when he said bijay krishna gosvami the naturally he asked either brahman if it is mother okay but with form without form krishna that which is brahman is also kali why krishna is telling this because they used to criticize goddess kali in those days very much and some of the time the conversation with the doctor who is to visit sirama krishna he remarked very very badly we can say about the goddess kali before sirama krishna because the then educated people is to think because they were faded by somebody else and they thought that is their that's because they are coming from the foreign land they are telling this to accept that mr phil accepting them and surrama krishna alone is trying to rectify them so sirama krishna is telling brahm that which is brahman is also kali the mother the primal energy he said kali mother and what is this mother primal energy in the vedanta it says that the everything that the god is doing through the primal energy and this primal energy is telling the tantra accepted as goddess kali shakti sometimes durga sometimes kali certain many other forms so this is only the shakti the power primal energy when inactive it is called brahman this is the uniqueness of krishna the same energy same power same knowledge when inactive it is called brahman again when creating preserving destroying it is called shakti he is giving the example again that naturally it is very easy to understand the same power not active is called brahman when active it's called kali the tantra developed this conception and in the shankar we find the the same they say purusa and prakriti because we have you have to explain the creation the god just thought and everything has come that is true of he that was the way the creation but you have to explain otherwise the philosophy won't stand and to explain you have to give the reason and what is the reason reason the main problem who is the creator and what is the material with which he created that is the main problem of the philosophy and unless you can explain these your thought cannot be accepted as a philosophy so every philosophy all the religion they first they tried to explain this point and in hinduism they said it is god who himself became two and one is a nadi another is another so ardha nari shwara ishwara the god of our part he became the man a half again is the o man god himself it is one way again he said god through its power and that is called maya the primal energy created god is not weak god has knowledge god has power and only problem the material it is he himself then if the god is creating out of himself then is he exhausted no there the vedanta says it is the reflection it is only maya these all different ways they try to explain but suramar he is trying to convince the bijay krishna gosvami that you people think that goddess kali is an image-only stone image no the goddess kali is the primal energy and when that brahman the consciousness whom you are praying is active that is called kali the two same thing in two different names brahman and again it says still water is an illustration of brahman and same water moving in waves may be compared to shakti kali what is the meaning of kali she who consumes with mahakala the absolute is kali kala the time the period the mahakala the conception of the shiva in the tantra always shiva shakti the tantra also explaining vedanta also explaining in this way and the bhakti shootra also explaining the creation the god wanted so he has created and the tantra will say the brahman that is shiva that's why inactive and the same shiva same brahman active in connection with the consciousness the shiva it is called kali the kali is not separate from the shiva kali is standing on shiva so this is also we have to understand the consciousness and the action that should go together the knowledge and the action she is formless and again she has forms if you believe in the formless aspect then meditate on kali as that if you meditate on any aspect of her with form conviction she will let you know our true nature then you will realize that not merely does god exist but he will come near to you and talk to you as i am talking to you suramar krishna i feel in this way is to give the hint that he is the god as i am talking to you the god comes near you and he also talks with but we have to understand because in the contemporary people it is very difficult krishna was there he was eating sleeping talking to people visiting people is just common and it was very difficult for those people to accept him as god very few could do that when sri krishna was there in in his sri krishna form majority of the people couldn't understand they misunderstood him that he is the supreme god so assalamu krishna he is giving the hint he will come and he will talk to you as i am talking to you have faith and you will achieve everything remember these two this is a very important teaching that he is giving here remember this too if you believe that god is formless then stick to that belief with form conviction this is sirama krishna this is the unity in diversity and is a unique way he is giving this message when all people they're fighting because of their ego behind their tradition or the teaching sri ramakrishna is open sudama krishna is telling only this if you believe the god is formless then stick to that belief with form conviction but do not be dogmatic never say emphatically about god that he can be only this and not that this is the basic training of srila krishna one should not say that god is this and not that it is not possible god is infinite and in infinite ways infinite manners he can manifest you may say i believe that god is formless but he can be many things more he alone knows what else he can be i do not know i do not understand that is the true way if only the religious teachers they could understand these two lines and there will be no conflict in the whole world between the or among the different faiths this much no conversion no changes if you like to follow your own method follow it and follow it doggedly follow it with all sincerity but don't say that is the only path and god can be realized with only that don't use that only that is the path and others whatever they are doing that too will lead them to god so god should not be limited and that is the main teachings of the harmony of religion he can and it he says that how can man with his one ounce of insulin intelligence know the real nature of god can you put your seer four shades of milk in a one-sided jar exam krishna giving that example if god through his grace even reveals himself to his devotee and makes him understand then he will know but not otherwise the god belongs to all why because god is all without god there is nothing friends if we see that the guru nanak there's a story the guru nanak was traveling he was from the part of the northern part of india the punjab and those part and in one place he was resting you know these people used to walk to and to visit different places there he was resting under the tree and his legs were towards the kaaba towards the east and and some people came and they protested you cannot place your legs to this because in this side our god belongs our holy place belongs to that nanaka's answer was very unique well friends take my lake and put to in that direction where there is no god the god is everywhere god in every direction when the hindus they worship the goddess durga the ten hands why again it is symbolic not that the god is having the ten hands the ten hands means ten directions that means god is everywhere through that image this is the message the people should understand the god is everywhere here also guru nanak is telling the god is everywhere well friends don't be angry with me i don't know where there is no god if you know that please place my leg to that direction i don't have any objection so this is the teaching of true religion when one realizes god what he realized he sees that god is everywhere but that is the way the lord jesus is also speaking the same god is within me and the kingdom of heaven is within you the same purity kingdom of heaven he meant same purity the same purity is in u2 this is the realization afterwards he said each soul is potentially divine each soul there is no difference that if you are following only my path my physical philosophy then only your soul is pure no not like that each soul is potentially divine anyone realizing god will understand this and if he is not talking in the same line that means he has not realized god that after the god realization from any path any form any philosophy this will be the this will be the knowledge that he will acquire there was a jaffa ali from the sufi tradition and zafural used to say sarah pined masjid the same tradition allow me to enjoy my drink sitting wherever i am or if you think this is a pure place holy place i should not drink well tell me where there is no god i will go to that place and see it over there is there any place where is no god if god is everywhere and god belongs to everyone because god is all this is the vedantic teachings ramakrishna is giving and such a wonderful and sweet way why because soaked in the syrup of devotion this is telling like that god is everywhere that which is brahman is shakti and that again is the mother suramar krishna is telling that it is better to remember the god as mother why because mother is a conception in every everywhere wherever you are the mother is that who takes care of the children and if we think god as mother then there is so so less i have done some mistake and i know it is the mother will never ever tell me to go out and banish if i have the conception of a father god and there may be that father is angry and banishing the children go out of my place but mother will never say that that's why this very soft very kind very compassionate conception of god in the form of the mother sudama krishna is insisting that you must take it becomes easy for us to approach to god and what we should do we should just pray and pray with tears and mother's heart immediately she will forgive us and grant us whatever we are praying ram prasad sirama krishna is singing a ram prasad song and ram prashadi is also is telling that brahman and kali are the same and in the you know that ram prasad those who knows the rampart songs now it has been translated into english also some of you can read so this ram prasad is also again and again telling kali brahma janae marmo dharma dharma shaft chilici knowing understanding that the brahman and the kali are the same now i have given up what is the righteousness what is unrighteousness there is nothing no difference everything belongs to god so that is a dharma means unrighteousness unrighteous actions action forbidden by the religion and dharma means the pious actions prescribed by the religion for instance charity feeding the poor brahmins etc so these all that ram prasad is telling and there is no difference between kali and the brahman only two words in the bhagavata also we find bhagavan then brahman they're all same and east bijay krishna what remains if one renounces both dharma dharma sram krishna's answer there's a very pertinent question when the ramp quoting ram prusas ramakrishna is telling i know the goddess kali that means the god in the form of action creating and then preserving and destroying and also the brahman without action are the same then i know i need not to do anything everything is that brahman or kali and he used two words dharma and other righteousness unrighteousness now bijay krishna he is asking like a very ordinary person and it is good for us he asked that question he said what remains if one renounces both dharma and a dharma answer it cannot come from intellect it cannot come from book reading it's from the realization and when one becomes god himself this answer can come then he said pure love pure love for god then he was immediately one sentence only two words that is sufficient to what remains when there is no righteousness and unrighteousness pure love for god nothing else i'm not asking anything from god not even the heaven i just love you and salaam krishna quoting from his own as if how one should pray he said i pray to the divine mother mother here take thy dharma and here take the dharma righteousness and unrighteousness and give me pure love for thee and he continued take thy virtue and take thy wise and give me pure love for thee take the knowledge and take the ignorance and give me pure love for thee you see i didn't ask even for knowledge of the public recognition when one renounces both dharma and dharma there remains only pure love of god love that is stainless motiveless and that one feels only for the sake of love love for love's sake in the this lecture on the devotion he used his love for love's sake love knows no barters swami vivekananda said the i will love you in exchange if you love me and i give you some gifts in exchange you should also remember my birthday and give me some gift back if that is the condition of love we cannot say that is love love only one way i just love and i don't have any demand and i don't have anything i don't want anything in return so that is called divine love when you love to god whether god will give bless me or i will be protected i will be all i don't care that is very very pure when nothing remains in the mind the remains this purity purity of love and god is love what is god nothing but love and when swami vivekananda was asked about sudama krishna was the god himself the swamiji he said o sirama krishna l-o-b-e personified only love love concern for others oh these people are suffering how to go and help them guide them and permanent solution turn your mind towards god and you will get the peace the joy the happiness and if you have the desire to become somebody in the society that also you will get but before that you turn your minds towards god then bijay krishna is asking is god different from shakti we have asked him a very good question is god different from shakti after attaining perfect knowledge one realizes that they are not different if we read every line of the gospel we find the whole philosophy there and those who don't have any idea about the vedanta philosophy and the devotional push number path it's very difficult to understand krsna's answers apparently so simple they are the same like the james and the brilliance but before that he said after attaining perfect knowledge one realizes that they are not different after realizing after convincing oneself that yes is the god and everything is done through god's power without the god's power nothing is can be there and power cannot be there if there is no god so they are interdependent and they are the same and cinema krishna is giving the answer like the james and the brilliance thinking of the game one can cannot but think of the brilliance again they are like the milk and the whiteness now if we close our eyes and think about milk and what we'll think about the white liquid isn't it so whiteness and the milk cannot be separated they're so interrelated the god and the shakti are interrelated they can never be separated thinking of one you must also think of the other but you cannot realize this non-duality before the attainment of perfect knowledge friends here again the attention should be given you cannot realize this non-duality the duality is so common and we are born because of this duality again and again we are coming to this circle of birth and death because of this duality because i i am separate from others because of the i the ego we are taking birth we are taking forms so obviously to go beyond this is really really very difficult so he is telling this but you cannot realize this non-duality before the attainment of perfect knowledge attaining perfect knowledge one goes into samadhi samadhi means forgetting the body consciousness those who have tried to meditate you know the our mind always goes out and it is so difficult to control if you ask any question to anyone immediately first question will be how to control the mind even the personality like arjuna of the mahabharata fame that arjuna is also telling the krishna if you ask me to do these do that it is possible but to control the mind is impossible so that is why when they say samadhi the wind ghost one goes to samadhi when one forgives the whole body and his own existence and how it is possible there is no ego when we forget that i consciousness so naturally anything associated with that i that is my body that is my all the belongings my mind my family everything goes away and then only samadhi beyond the 24 cosmic principles therefore the principle i does not exist in that stage a man cannot describe in words what he feels in samadhi because there is no i so how he will record oh these are things that i am feeling the completely different friends these words that we are reading we are trying to understand intellectually unless and until then realization comes a deep meditation experience of dick meditation comes is very difficult to understand but at least we can understand from the words of bhagavan si rama krishna that this is a feeling where there is no i and as because there is no i what remains joy love peace extreme happiness so that is the feeling after coming back they could express sat them after the realization when they came down and when the people asked the disciple asked then the they said this is ananta it is eternal no aims no beginning and it is the truth truth means also existence then the knowledge and also the pleas did that debate and it says a man cannot describe in words what he feels in samadhi coming down he can give just a hint about it i come down a hundred cubics as it were when i say om after samadhi because even the conception of home also is lost brahman is beyond the injunctions of the vedas and cannot be described then neither i nor you exist brahman is beyond the injunctions of the veda the veda is described the rishis the pure souls the seers whatever they felt realized in the pure mind calm composed mind whatever the reflection came that they have recorded but obviously they could not describe the brahman because it is beyond any description satchit ananda sarupa that much they could say this is the existence knowledge and please eternal absolute so this is the way they have described but this is only these three and nothing else again no it can be beyond that we do not know at least this is the way we could describe so that is as long a man is conscious of i and you and as long as he feels that it is who prays or meditate so long will he feel that god is listening to his prayer and that god is a person and that is why again and against ramakrishna said practic practicing the pure knowledge path is very very very difficult in the bhagavad-gita also krishna is telling the same thing if we try to do that our energy will be spent on something and we won't get any return sometimes some parents they want that their children should become a doctor and they admit them in the medical college maybe after two years then that student will feel it is impossible for me to pursue this particular subject so he comes back and goes to another so naturally two years and all that energy is lost first and second he also lost the self-confidence why couldn't do that and people again and again will remind him or you couldn't be successful in the medical school right so that is the way one also feels i won't be able to realize god so choosing a path is very important and that is why bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling if you think that god is without form of course he is without form stick to that path and sincerely follow that along with that also remember don't say this is the only path don't be dogmatic that is the teaching of bhagavan sirama krishna and he says anyone and everyone can realize god this mostly some people are they because they had some other thing in mind they wanted to sell religion and earn some money and the prestige in the society they said only this class of people can realize god and nothing else nobody else you have to go through us to god suramar krishna is breaking that the god belongs to all whoever will pray to god with a faithful open heart the god will come to him if he wants to see god with form that is also good without form that's also okay in any form that's also okay only one thing is necessary the faith in the existence of god fast second sincerity to pursue i think we should stop over here thank you friends up to this and the next day again we'll start from 3 35 a page yeah yes any questions is a virtual means you're listening isn't it and when you are listening that is the sangha but physically in person when you come and sit before someone talking to him that is the different impressions of course but you know sadhu means his instructions not that particular person but the instruction now this one hour we were having the company of god bhagavan sirama krishna his unique way of explanations and so many things we have learned so why we should not get benefit in the online sadhu-sanga we'll get that the next question is from what is the significance of various weapons which different gods used to hold well twin is a very good question but you know in hinduism if you see almost all gods and goddesses are having some weapons but hinduism is a very meek and very docile and it never kills and never says anything to go and kill nothing like that why this because that is a symbol of power hinduism when you see the picture or the images they give the image at the back of it there is a philosophy some ideas some conceptions and god is all-powerful and to give that conception they give those powers in those days it was like that astra and sastra and this to say and some of the weapons there is to hold and fight some of the weapons there is to throw so both are there to keep that conception god is is powerful how can we realize god is everywhere oh this is a practice shipra that you have to go on practicing it the god is everywhere sometimes we see the flower gardens and we see the flower gardens and immediately we are overwhelmed to see that beauty oh beautiful the flower garden but we forget who has given those colors what's giving those wonderful the flower so each and everything that you see just take your mind back to god and say thank you god for giving us this beautiful scenery birds that singing the ear the river and the beautiful nature and along with that you have given some villains also there are deers and at the same time tigers and there are good people there are some bad people so like that if in the life there is there is no villain no one will go to see the movies in the movies all good people they are sitting together helping each other do you think people will go to the see the movie no so even in the bad people even in the villains also that god's grace is there he's uh or it is acting as the god directed so in that way in good in bad in everything try to see god and today's imagination tomorrow's realization thank you so let us conclude with this pranam mantra niranjanam is oh [Music] [Applause] namaste um
