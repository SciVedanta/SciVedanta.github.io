[171. Panchama Veda 171 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqh75IDHltg)

it is between this wood hi consider a great scripture and Chama Veda with this local telecom written top the jeevan KO be rewritten commercial iran among golems sorry madam boo be grinning de bourree dodging ah here we were studying the gospel of salaam tishner and we were reading from page 436 now Ramakrishna was conversing with a person named Marie and he was asking some very interesting questions why he takes long time to realize God he is asking said why it takes for some people long time to realize God salam krishna's cause answer was very direct and he says because they do not feel restless by god we have already discussed about that now the our mind it goes on thinking so many things and this is a very special instrument that we are having if we call it an instrument God has given us and these whereever we focus we get success what is the success we come to know about it totally if you are studying the mathematics pivoting on the mathematics we become successful in mathematics how by concentrating our mind on that particular subject and in song in dances and games we're even now someone is playing now the World Cup is going on a very very important player when he's going down to play suddenly the thought of his son came or he was not keeping well how easy do you think he'll be able to play over there you won't be a soldier fighting in the border if he thinks about his family you won't be able to perform his proper duty in properly so all of these things depends on mind only whose mind my mind not God realization the highest knowledge the knowledge if I get it then I get the total peace happiness joy success everything in this world and also the other world everything comes under my power after God realization naturally we can imagine how difficult it is and how much concentration is necessary the whole mind has to put into that so ceramic richness telling they do not feel Restless for God we are filling restlessness in different way but about God we are not feeling that way the Restless this restlessness again the another way if we when we want something we want to achieve even to get the success that time we can imagine how much wrestlers will become suppose you were driving you have to reach somewhere a very important exam is there your job is depending on that interview how much restlessly will become if the the Sun and the traffic jam is there something happened how much restlessly will become to reach over there to realize that God also that restlessness so ceramic Krishna just try utilizing this one world restlessness he explained the whole thing because why people cannot realize God and it takes a long time because they are not Restless for God then the hurry again asking why is there so much suffering in the world this is a very common question even at the time of ceramic distance before maybe some people have already asked but that was not recorded at least this was recorded and we know now also people say we don't believe in God if the God is there why so much of suffering this is a very common question and it also crosses our mind why so much of suffering Saddam hawkish na the moment he is asking this question we can understand activities raising as a philosophical discussion what is that creator and the creation why there's so much of suffering in this world the suffering is a different thing joy is also their suffering is theirs okay but the question is why this world where from it came when what is exactly this world ease and the scientists they from their own point of view they are trying to get the answer about the Big Bang and these and they're so many ways they are going on trying to get a satisfactory so perfectly answer then religion is complete in a different way it goes and in the Hinduism is very clearly it says that dualist they're quoting from the bhagavata it says what is that we have already stirred very studied there recently we have read the last Sunday we read before creation in the Bhagavata is a duellist book because the God is separate and I am separate that is Vishnu is the Krishna that way they always see and dear what they say before creation I alone was the goddess sitting there and when a man who was supposed to die on the seventh day and he has disgusting and the great sage sukadeva instead of giving directly the answer he is describing the whole creation what is that creation before creation I either God the supreme consciousness alone was there being no other existence of the nature of cause and effect different from me cause and effect different from me but this cause and effect this effect is this world and what is the cause God God is the cause and this world is the effect and obviously and there is no difference causes and there's no difference and after the creative this cycle ends when this creation aims I alone exist we all say all religions believe then this will be destroyed one day all these things that we are making the wonderful things that we are happening one day nothing will be me everything will be again from the new it will come and how I think that we do not know and all science fiction's different type of things people are imagining and putting forward this will be like this this will be like that it goes on but I alone exist this universe is also my self the syllables that you see is also myself before going to the answer once Ramakrishna we should know the truth about the creation from the viewpoint of the Hindus and other religions also say the same thing God has created so the wind that God is creating this world how from his own after the creation got a loan and exists so everything even this manifested universe that you see is also nothing but the God in the bhagavad-gita we get two words Chaitra shelter again Chaitra Chaitra KO jeonnam ya touch Ghanim bottom mama say krishna the god he says those who are having the knowledge of chaitra this manifested universe and the shade dragon who is living with this manifested thing that is the art man or the j-turn near the consciousness one who is have the full knowledge of this tool is that perfect knowledge Chaitra Chaitra Georgiana Chitra jung-hyun am Chitra they know Gianna Gianna means knowledge knowledge about the consciousness and also the inner thing that together is this universe this manifestation if you had tech knowledge that is the perfect knowledge and Gita has turned this to a Chaitra energy Chaitra IAM conscious this too and that is the knowledge and here in the palaver Teresa's home Eva are sameba agree na onion yet sir Assad Brahma such existence assert non-existence nothing was there you cannot say it was not there you cannot say it was there there's a peculiar very very special condition NASA none now Assad would Chetty sat assert such means existence Asaf means non-existence nothing was there then what was there exactly the same word has been used by the Gianni's the non-dual is the dualist they are using this word non well is also used in the same world the same way so this is a hung over I only awesome IVA agree I was there all alone who is this I now here we fight here we differ who is this I somebody is telling this is Allah because we know it somebody's in his god somebody stealing is Bhagavad some say Vishnu sounds at these these these this all differences with desire and the Jesus said keep your burden on me I am the path and I am the way bus Jesus is the path and know nothing so we are all ready we understand understood it properly then Krishna say sarva-dharman but it that Germany come Karen Abuja forget about all other things only dependent me and Christian is the only Christian is the only who is that high that we have to understand and unless and until we understand that posture Ibrahim etc etcetera hamish mean I only remain butchered means after the dissolution when everything will go away what will remain I and what is that I that we had to realize and nobody could explain no one could gives Ramakrishna he is sleeping I want to tell you that but somebody is as if placing my throat won't allow me to tell that means is beyond time space and causation through the wars you cannot express once I saw the sunrise and in that skull far loot a place in the Himalaya and you have to go through that chilling that one would place the very and from the earth when the Sun is rising it is not yet come out only that way and then it is creating different type of beauties on the clouds under snows on the dark green Oh wonderful people they were going on taking the snaps but you think if they published those photographs you'll be able to understand that to some extent but those who were dear shooting in the core and looking at the head the joy the happiness the wonder the all the all those things that they were having they will never be able to express it that is impossible to express through words because it is a feeling if it is so just imagine how one can express about the God so they are even only some examples joy happiness love unselfishness those are the things which we can understand they're using those words to give us some glimpses there so but it's not like that that that what he says postured homage idea of a she shedder saw Hamish mean and non dwellest also they're also cutting from the Phoenicians I will just got one line it says that Eva Samia Edom upgra acid akin Eva our tedium the very famous water so he was addressing he was giving the answer to his son so he is addressing the son as a dear one so Amir the Tier one that this was only one that Eva Samia Edom Graci what is that econ and Aditya eekum one was sufficient and repeating Artyom now this is the whole thing in the beginning there was only one and not two now see ramakrishna is giving the answer to these what he says see Ramakrishna is telling that from his own realization he's telling this world is the leela of god he is using the word Lila please divine play leader and majority of our that waiting they always talk about the divine play Lina this leader means why he is doing it nobody knows and you cannot ask the God also why you are doing like this no one can ask question so this is the divine bill he wanted to so Lina it is like a game there are joy and solo virtue and vice knowledge and ignorance good and evil the game cannot continue if sin and suffering are altogether eliminated from the creation if seen and suffering all together ready winning eliminated from the creation so naturally that everybody is so good now some they talk about that Satya Yuga and scepter you got so good so good so good but there was something must be there Roger and Tama so some mad was mixed otherwise that you gonna be there because of the way we need we are driving the car because there is some in the tire when they're moving so that is going on suppose it is black ice and the tire is going on moving and really going on moving then what will happen Stevie you don't have the control so to keep the control we need that friction so that is the reason Roger and drama is necessary even in the cetera but the friction intensity was less then slowly slowly in the Tama Hyuga that friction intensity is much more that's all this is the difference gradation only so here he says that otherwise how it will and we find that in the game of hide-and-seek the mostly the the we used to play too hide-and-seek one must touch the granny in order to be free there is a center figure somebody sitting and you have to come and touch the moment you can come and touch the granny 10 pure free and when you are free suppose so everybody comes and touches the granny then what will happen the game is over so obviously the opposition they are working not to allow the others to comment touch the granny they are covering the granny from different corner granny also wants the police should continue minimum half an hour 40 minutes over now or otherwise what was the game the similarly but the granny is never pleased if she is touched at the very outset before it is there now 1810 Dukla has gone to batting everybody's thinking that we will see a beautiful game in the first ball searching is born out what will happen I heard how forgotten that famous cricketer he just started playing the first ball he was bold out and the ampere raise the finger and he said hey bring down your hand people have come to see my game not your hand good batsman that is the he was that person so naturally before the game we have come to see that game before that without what is that people who say what is it why you have come over here - it potentially should be George Aristotle and then only otherwise what so this what the game is going on now result of more must be a joke I don't know that they say there was a very rich man once he went to see that sock at the football game that we say in our country and this side dealer went that side when they were playing and he said why so many people with one ball is playing well they are fighting I know that that is they have tried to catch the vault put in the goal how many are there were 22 keep 22 balls re 22 balls if your key there is no game so obviously this is the ignorance so if we can understand these somebody is happening but the person who is suffering of course he is suffering then why that particular person is suffering then the Hindus they they offer another theory karma theory because of the karma and some some people say it is seen and we call it karma bad karma as because and nowadays even in the American movies they are using these terminologies I notice here this watching that one movie that you two men told bad karma oh my god so since the terminology is creeping in so that is the bad karma the bad karma means something bad we have done if it will come result will come though obviously and then you can take it as a bad karma or seen whatever because of that who did I did it why because I was deluded I couldn't understand that this is good or bad so that's nice Paco bonds is telling you have to constantly hold the hand of your father if you are holding the hand of your father there is no chance of falling the our father should that way you have to prick your father so this goes on this way otherwise there may be some problem and this creation goes on this way and surround business giving the answer the game of hide-n-seek then he's singing a beautiful song that was composed by agreed sadaqa out of hundred thousand guides a twist but one or two break free looking after do toku riccati to me 'she Douma at the chapati chapati means clapping hey she with joy look in millions and millions only one the sodaw all that trying to go out only one will get free and that the mother who was plea she is very happy of that one has been successful then one Swami was explaining this way sharma vivek endures direct disciple from a peerage analogy he was telling another Swami this coating is a very difficult life the spiritual life to get the Mukti completely freed freedom from this bondage you have to go on striving striving and striving and in median only one will get the freedom then there show you my god then what will happen to me so I am striving but I don't know then immediately the Swami - how do you know that you are not that particular one just like don't think that you won't get that freedom so thinking that I am going to be fast we must have to study oh I all be able to do so it is not mean sir to study like that I am going to the bust so that is the inspiration the determination and the result what will happen happen I don't bother I am going to do what I was supposed to do that's all that is why it goes on telling in other words after the the practice of hard spiritual disciplines Ramakrishna's telling one to have the vision of God through His grace and are liberated the liberation then who did vision of God is so difficult and so some people who are striving majority become hypocrites why it is so highly the morality and the philosophy is so high in the beginning the start and in one time comes they cannot go back so difficult people groups will be only going on telling different things and cheating people by that way they passed their life so this is the problem so that so high one must be very very careful whatever happens it doesn't matter when strong will be waking others to come to see Ramakrishna was to love him so much we know but suddenly he stopped talking with him looking at him after almost a month instead young boy Narendra not who became famous afterwards as Shani Vivekananda I don't talk to you where do you come over here then you say shy I love you so I come sad so they come to you whether you like me or not doesn't matter I like you it's like that the love only one way going with that God will look at me or not whether even st. the grace or not I don't bother most of the people after some time if it is not successful no I have stopped worshipping God and so whether you worship or you don't worship it doesn't matter to God it matters to you you once a Darcy in Andaman he told I have worshipped this book the Guru Granth side they worshiped at and for so many years now my wife is dead my son is dead why should I worship this shall I treat out and the way you started were children you can take my permission you started your own if you like to try to throw it when you are asking me now I am hesitant to throw it and then don't row go and worshipping so that is the way we have to understand God is only watching us all the things that are happening our karma so many good things happened to us each and every one of us have got so many good things we forget that and that is the reason we have to remember all the time so many good things has happened to me and I was just watching one report that was published about this California Southern California so many people are now leaving and on the streams Sony and suffering and so many things are happening they were born over here in America the best country as you can think of in the world but still they are suffering who to blame so many opportunities are there you have to utilize that opportunity we could not utilize that opportunity now we are on the pavements now we are suffering whom to blame so that Saddam who kissed instilling the play game is going on so if you go to any country in the world and say that I am coming from America they will look at you my god as if you are coming from the evidence of course some of the countries are not angry with America if you say they will kill you immediately so but problem is is ours not of these two naturally cinema business dealing now another question he is asking the hurry but this play of God is our depth is a very genuine question it is a game for the guards a play of the guard that's okay but it is in our depth we are suffering God is playing now again granted philosophical answer see Ramakrishna smiling please tell me who you are that is dancing now this is a death for me exactly before that's why I was quoting from here from the Twitter from the non well advaitha all are telling it is God who has created the universe and is God only living in different forms it is God who is suffering who it is God who is causing the suffering all this answer is there this philosophical thing if this heart what is philosophy the answer to the myth mysteries and if the thought is there strong in our mind I am the god but only bring in the other side that's all the one man he was a landlord and he actually promoted he gave the money and to start one program that drama then he said when he saw the people are practicing he said I also want a character you want to but he was not very good any anything to the okay he will be there as a the one who is solving others and you should not talk because it will be difficult with the person who taught properly them could not memorize all the dollar so you should not talk you should be as you can and your owner will torture you later and the woman became the landlord in the play became his own servant and the servant took that opportunity most of the time this master used to scold him and this is the opportunity in the drama he started a little bit more I think so and then he proved the whole thing and today don't forget I am the master in reality so anyway the drama broke down everything hunter but the reality came in that way so I have to tell to myself I don't know Dee I am the master we playing this role so the suffering and all those things I wanted that to play like it dumb serving there's okay now we never I want to become the master I can manifest I can break the game and say don't forget I am the master so the same way Sadam business smiling until it please tell me who you are god alone has become all these Maya the universe the living means and the 24 cosmic principles then easily as the sneak a bite and as the charmer a cure both a car the person who is getting the sneak by also god the snake also God and the chairman who is coming of the doctor who is coming to save also God that is the ultimate knowledge were so difficult that's why when we we know these theoretical like this like this but we I will prefer to be a doctor than a patient suppose it is a drama and I am suffering and the doctor is coming else's please give me the role of a doctor - a suffer unnecessarily so obviously that will be and if you want then you have to go on praying to God Oh God yet the - nam come that they were charming Oh God let me see you benign face that's the prayer when they pray to God they do not say the way in your hand they look at me never they say I want to see you smiling benign face and that is the prayer yet deduction am come that they shall be no one wants to blame in this way Oh God please give me the world where I am or suffering that won't be possible but only one person breathe give me all suffering do you remember who prayed like that huh Kunti that great Queen Kunti she only prayed God please give me suffering put me always in the suffering so that I can remember you at that time also the power to remember God and that condition there should be God's grace God is giving the suffering and also giving the mental strength to fear that and that is why we have to pray to God every moment and say I won't be able to bear all the suffering please don't give me that role I want to see your beautiful face benign to his happy face make me like that one lady was nicely telling though anything that comes to me before doing that I go and look at the face of Saddam fish nur and mother if I find that they are smiling I think that will be successful I go who is looking at the faces of mother and talk to that lady and she is reflecting our success the great faith if I see the smiling face of the ceramic isten mother I am sure that I am going to be successful in this and I go and get the success and sometimes before that when I go and say I see now they are not smile at all smiling so what to do I have to go I go and then hole through the street all so that when I am traveling I go on praying please be happy with me please be happy with me but sometimes we fail but after that I can stand it was good for me I didn't get that job I can get the success that was good for me that's why Thakur and ma told now he should not do that so this is the whole thing we have to understand that is someone there's something always very very conscious and all around us we can see that particular consciousness but the consciousness can understand being so having that failed if we go on praying all our this present life will be pleasant and having death wait if we go and bring let me go out of this game I am tired of it that also be granted Mukti is nothing for God only using about letting him go that's all and he will get that mukthi if you have brain ignorance knowledge and perfect wisdoms Ramakrishna is mentioning what is the ignorance is just a person wearing a colored glass it's not the darkness he sees things he understands but he is wearing a colored glass so he sees through that wheel the one lady was travelling in a car and his as a tinted glasses colored glasses inside the EC in the car EC and outside well beautiful we can see then she was telling or just like the puja whether you know that in the autumn in our country the weather is so good and then she was telling it just like the puja whether that means not done immediately he stopped the car and his husband and told get out and you see what is that order my is he so much of another so he chose battery and so things I am spending and from here at the sitting at the back seat and you are looking through the glass and it is becoming so wonderful whether this burning outside to go and see and she is also correct demand gentleman is also correct and what is that because that lady was seeing through the glasses so we will look at the this world oh he is my brother she is my sister this is my family this is my country this is my religious people and all the had tinted glass colored glass look like that and that is the ignorance and here all the differences we see what is ignorance differences now second comes the knowledge and the knowledge he sees everything with clear eyes and also collect proper informations about the object those who are studying the philosophy those who are practicing meditation and those who are constantly reading the holy books and having the holy company they go on telling me themselves and also others all that you see is nothing but the God but that is only knowledge we can call it bookish knowledge or intellectual knowledge that much when the difficulty will come will they be able to be read that is the main thing there are many many mom's they won't be able to pierrat that is we have seen the great promise and when they give the talk and so many people and then afterwards some problem comes that they cannot be a so it is so difficult only then intellectual knowledge you won't do but it is better than the ignorance that must they say it is better than the ignorance ignorant people they always think in a one gentleman came I was reading in the newspaper he is a Fisher man he came and then got down from the board and he came home and he found that the wife is talking over telephone and if you can so hanley why some people told your wife keep in watching her all the time having some relation at someone you notice that she is talking with someone this man came and you know after the hard labor he came maybe he was intoxicated the moment he saw that without questioning asking or waiting for anything he took out the sword cut the head of the wife and then understood that I'm going to be restrict that foolishness taking the shivered aid and the soul he went stood straight to the polish of course the foolish people do you are I think seeing the terrible scene now why ignorant afterwards I came to know her father was admitted in the hospital in an accident and she was talking naturally the daughter that she was talking with her brother and taking an idea what has happened to the father how seniors it is exaggerated a little bit patience and because of the anger somebody told something influenced by that see how wrong we do now that man all all through his life will be crying but it is a different type of suffering but why ignorance the treble ignorance the same way seeing things we do by mistake a little bit of something happened immediately I know one young lady she hurt me a lot but her mother told her whoever I like to talk to your elder sister if the sister was recently married the mother was talking because after the marriage there are so many other problem comes because the new adjustment so that is a different thing the mother from her experience wanted to help there Marit daughter and this curve was not knowing all that she also wanted to come in but the elder sister was hesitant to open up before her sister the mother took her away we are talking immediately she failed the mother is not giving proper attention and mother is giving full love to that disturb our elder sister she committed suicide so this type of emotional thing but good she did not too hard not to family why ignorance wouldn't you wait and see what is happening it doesn't matter that's why I always always remember there will be people who likes you like you and healthy people don't like you it does not matter at all when the Buddha was there a man of love and compassion the Swami became the stilling Buddha's heart even full of love and compassion and that man also was hated by some people they wanted to kill him this is the world it's like that and who the was loved and respected but so many similarly in our life also there will be some people who criticizing some people loving never even so this is the very practical way of understanding this world when you are reading the scripture the God has made this whole universe and suffering and Joy's nothing but its game that is playing we are sometime in a good position or bad position this is all philosophy but what about the practical life practical life is this nothing is permanent and something is always there some people will like you for sure and some people may not like if that is also for sure so do not take it so seriously I am trying in my own way that is the TG so ignorance then knowledge then comes wisdom and in the wisdom not only understands but that person is capable to utilize that knowledge in his day-to-day life that is convinced of the wisdom is completely different than when you read the books the Philosopher's are very knowledgeable people person and is not a man of wisdom the Jesus a man of wisdom Lord put the mana wisdom they realized that we utilize that the whole knowledge in their own life the Philosopher's will say in different way but they do not understand the one gentleman came and told I do not see all this type of thing in the middle part why you are keeping like this now we have to explain this is a different situation this is different thing and all those things so that is the knowledge now this is the different situation I should understand it which rami become the chemo buddy and nobody taught him anything everybody was ready to find faults in him but he himself observed and meetings are perfect because the situation the society background we are coming completely different completely different so obviously after coming over here I have to adjust and I cannot keep up the whole thing my originality after some time when he became very friendly with the other people in America then one day he was using his fingers to eat the food and also leaking as in our country as we do if the food is very tasty we also try to leave the fingers and for the last test so he was doing there then one of his friends / Swami that is not good on the dining table you should not do like that so stop I have suffered a lot you see you're all those things there's your fork and a spoon let me enjoy my food in my own way by licking my fingers so naturally that this is the way sometimes we do our own knowledge the perfect wisdom ceramic history is telling in the words of the vagabonds Ramakrishna he was a the eonni is there he sees that God alone exist and the doer that he creates preserves and disturbs that is the God he's doing he understand that is called gianni in the world of ceramic is not the man of knowledge but the person with wisdom began he gave the word big Gianni sees that God who has become modest now let us conclude quoting the kshitij Petro punishes a very famous Upanishad and it goes on killing us once three two one boom arm see you are the lady and you are the gentle man kumara Watauga Kumari to unseeded Undine a bunch is like an old person you are torturing on the with the help of a steep but it's also you and you were also young at the same time Tommy jar to poverty you were born and again he were passing through all these changes then lastly he's using the word shut Oh God all the faces that you see all the images that you see is nothing but you everything is Oh God the serum kishna is giving the answer this re we should be thankful to gentlemen he asks the wonderful questions and regard these wonderful words of wisdom the tightest that's why I call is this gospel of Sri Ramakrishna's bunch a movie every page will teach you in wonderful way the wonderful knowledge of the pernicious and observe the forgiving and all the speakers that is concluded need and [Music] gompa 3 the become by each for a mission medium dama dama bushnell she does on along Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti buddy you that said shridhama Krishna panda must do
