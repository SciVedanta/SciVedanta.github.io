[72: Panchama Veda 72: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4kE2D24Ofo)

listen to the grants I ramakrishna about his conversation and the God and this venture Nevada this will study after chanting this Java code harm rhythm dr. G venom go vivid eltham calma shop ahom straw Ghana mangalam srimad artem bowie kuhn and de bourrée dodgin ah no quon wish never devotee he was giving his opinion and in our last class we have listened that devotee he was giving his opinion and how one can realize God Saddam kishna asked him what is the way and then he gave the opinion and he said by chanting the name sell the chanting of God's name is enough chanting the name of God he said said the chanting of God's name is enough immediately this is the speciality bhagavan sri ramakrishna rectifying him he said I say chant the name of God and with eat pray to Him and pray to him that you may have love for him pray to God that your attachment to transit or things become less and less this is the most important thing unless and until we are praying to God taking the name of God but why that we do not know sometimes only to get some relief from some of the problems is that the purpose so this is very important and he said amo Krishna if we notice constantly every time is trying to take our mind to that higher stand higher level to realize God and that's why he declared God realization is the goal of every human being not less than that all other things whatever we are doing it is ok so that's why he said the chanting the name of God is ok but only repeating the name of God without having the faith on hell so that is why he is telling prayer how can i pray if I have the faith what is that faith that God is there the existence of god that is it the most most important millions and millions of devotees are there if you go and individually ask them so you don't actually believe that God is there why it's not possible to conceive that idea is it really true can this be true so that way the how the conviction the God is there this is very very important and that's why he is immediately attaching this words addressing the whole humanity but only pointing to that particular vaishnava devotee chant the name of God and with it pray to Him and what is the prayer two things you may have love for him the love for God this is it is possible only when I think that existence of God he is there then I start liking all the qualities of God one lady came today she was telling that the young students maybe that she was talking with them one of them they asked why you were constantly praying and praising the Lord Rama oh he looks so good his eyes are so good his color is this why should we have to then she was little confused that's true why we are doing that see this is the expression of love if you talk to the mothers and ask her about their children they'll go on giving so many things telling them oh this is so good so good and so good expression of love so when the devotee is expressing talking about his most beloved so expression of love Victor talks like that this is very very natural and normal it should be the child is asking the boy is asking is true why we have to go on praising the god oh he is so good so beautiful the color is these wearing like these is these is that all these stotras that we chant is nothing but the pleasing of God why should have to do that to develop the love Sosa Ramakrishna is asking first you have to pray to God so that by His grace we get love for him so this is the most important thing that chanting the name of God at the same time praying to him that we may have love for him and secondly this is also very wonderfully he is putting very simple way please bless me that so they had attachment to translate things it becomes less and less attachment to transit or things this is very important because we are going to go away from this world leaving everything and it is sure today or tomorrow today or hundred years after but we are going to each and every one they will die and that is the truth now we like to cover this truth it is weakness and when a person who loves God he knows that where I am going I am going to God only so why should I be afraid I am going to the place where I really like to be so that is why you have to reduce otherwise a tremendous pain when there is some dry skin but it's not so dry that it will drop automatically if you are trying to remove it is so painful the blood will come it will be painful but when he it is very dry to automatically it falls up from the body the similarly if we are preparing God you have given me a ho many things I am so happy and grateful to you I have enjoyed my life but now slowly please give me detachment detachment detachment and what is detachment does it mean carelessness now very much careful but without attachment I keep everything so neat and tidy but if the moment comes if I have to go away I don't mind living and I will never turn back to that thing that is the that is the main training in the spiritual life or otherwise and and when the people are cannot understand these two the conception of swagger conception of heaven came and in that heaven what is there more good things enjoyable thing the more good and enjoyable things if it is there in the heaven someday that is also going to an end that we have to understand so we can never continue this thing so this is what see Rama Krishna is teaching and then yes he is telling so one should feel great restlessness of soul for the vision of God see Rama Krishna is continuing please close this door and he is telling that there is no doubt above the Santa T of God's name but can he mere name achieve anything without the yearning love of these devotees behind it one should feel great restlessness of soul for the vision of God suppose a man repeats the name of God mechanically while his mind is absorbed in something worldly can he achieve anything then the that man was giving the argument of the or Jamila the last is the time we discussed a Jamila was a person who committed lot obscene but he was thinking they'd a very good day peculiar thing he was convinced hundred percent faith the name of God just uttering the name of God can say me so he kept the name of God to his son so he knew that at the time of death I will call at least my son so he called that name and it was the name of God and it say that that he was saved then see Ramakrishna told but look at his faith it is not possible so much of faith our grease Chandra go she was having lot of faith in see Ramakrishna and he knew that he is god the touch of him and his things can rectify everything and he said if I knew that he is going to bless me I would have committed much more thing I was little hesitant I would have committed much more scene because I assure that he is going to sew that tape a hundred person faith if you have we can do anything because the field that is the main thing parsi Ramakrishna stirring there i chant the name of God and you pray that you may have love for him afterwards these awards are very very it did clear you can say and very relevant the present day world when people are killing each other in the name of religion look at it what see Rama Krishna is telling and now slowly many of the people most of the people religious leaders they are uttering these words following these words and this he saved with sincerity and earnestness one can realize God through all religions the people with whom he was talking with their vegetables and they have only one set of ideas this is the truth and nothing else I don't know how it developed because the Vishnu the word means all pervading beasts are 80 Mishnah the bish know the word means all-pervading and when it is all-pervading how it can be the sole narrow but somehow it develops and they become it becomes very easy to follow a narrow channel so cinema Krishna is giving this dictum with sincerity and earnestness one can realize God through all the religion then he is explaining again the bush neighbors will realize God and so will the shock ters shatters means the followers of shakti and bosh never the followers of Vishnu and the baton things those who are only following the veda and then the Brahmas that was newly formed over there at the time then he said the Muslims and the Christians will realize him to the greatness of a saint it was unthinkable that he is giving this taper and not that simply statement he practiced in his own life he showed that the truth can be achieved through any path but only two things are necessary one is sincerity another is our nationís these are the two things and then through any part it is possible and it says the Muslims and Christians will also realize him all will certainly realize God if they are honest and sincere now the question is when we are following a particular path but not realizing God that means this we are lacking in sincerity and hardness pneus that is true we should not blame we should not say that God is not there I tried but I didn't realize you have you are not sufficiently trying over that practicing that so that is the main thing some people indulge in kohls Sri Ramakrishna is explaining seeing one cannot attain anything unless one worship our Krishna now he is more elaborative we're to the point he is telling some people are so narrow minded they say only Krishna and all some people will say nothing can be gained without the worship of colleen our Divine Mother raghavan serum Krishna himself wish to worship goddess Kali but even then he is telling only go to Scully why so some p we'll say that only goddess Kali can savers or one cannot be saved without accepting Christian religion in those days the missionaries they used to say like that this is pure dogmatism the dogmatic says my religion alone is true and the religions of others are false this is a bad attitude God can be reached by different paths who are you to say have you realized God and you can say like that if you have realized God that is your path okay how can you say the others who are following the different parts that they are wrong that is why you will see the Hinduism when the people are worshipping just by the wayside by the side of the road some stones that is also accepted nobody is going and telling them oh why you are worshipping over here only a stone because if they are sincere they will realize God even by that some of the trees are worshipped thinking that if they're really sincere God will manifest over there and in the stories if you read the most of you have read in the Upanishads the gurus are asking the students bromwich airings take these cows and don't come until they are 10,000 or 1000 a few cows maybe 100 take them when their number is 1,000 then come back that was the teaching and concentrate concentrate concentrate sincerely and these boys are going there in the loneliness nothing is there and we're constantly remembering God meditating praying contemplating suddenly one day he heard nice talking with and telling a now we are 1000 let us go back how it is possible it is not the bull from his own with him but he's thought that the bull is talking and when we started that yoga we know when we are concentrating on a particular place then we can hear can understand the words of the animals too so this is what actually they are telling only two things are necessary sincerity sincerity and earnestness then some say God has formed and it is not it is formless the form and the formless the whole humanity is divided on this topic God with form God without fall the majority of the people the Hindus particularly they worship God with form and a huge number of people that believe that God is without form but if you go to their places so worship you will find so many different problems we doubt the form one cannot have at least in the beginning concentration of God we cannot place our mind in that idea unless and until we are having a form so that is why see Rama Krishna is very categorically he is mentioning that God has firm and he's also a doubt from thus they are calling a bush never calls with the baton taste Ballentine they say there is no fall it cannot be but the bush never says the God has come in the form of sickish no one can rightly speak of God only after one has seen him look at the statement one can rightly speak of God only after one has seeing him but majority of the people they have read some books and developed some conceptions over that they are talking and naturally there are many many gaps is not possible unless and until you go you see you stay you talk you realize yourself it is impossible to give the perfect account unless and until one has realized God it cannot and then again realizing God means work God with a form we have realized that much and then we say oh it is sufficient that much no we see in the lives of the Guru's of ceramic ISNA that that's why the biography of sri ramakrishna is very important for each and every devotee whatever path he is following it doesn't matter it keeps the clear idea when his own guru the lady guru will be brahmani she was not at all happy with another guru that he was following the be daunting path and without form she used to tell see Ramakrishna don't go to him he don't have any love for God and if you are going and talking with him your idea will break the don't going to go to him then afterwards cinema Krishna rectified out and then she realized again this branding guru was very mentally denouncing that the God has formed and someday he was just joking with ceramic esna a coyote top taro why you are clapping and taking the name of God and UPD prepare chapatis and major parties so that kororoti took there's no easy and roti to why I'm taking the name of God by clapping my hands you think like that then that guru learn the lesson and you understood that this is also true like the Shankaracharya himself he learned so this is very important so see ramakrishna is a museum of religion is the parliament of religions each and every idea everything has gone and has taken a perfect shape in it cinema krishna that's where the present-day people almost all of them knowingly unknowingly sometime mentioning without mentioning talking only the ideas of ceramic ISNA or otherwise it is impossible so narrow nails cannot be possible nowadays in modern days it is not possible because we know each other now because of the development of the science we are so close we know each other so obviously we have to have this my mentality even in spirituality so this is the new with anther neo with an that they say the new vid on the new conception what is the new conception we will see in the different pages how C ramakrishnan is talking one can rightly speak of God only after one has seen him this is most important otherwise it is not possible anyone here and there they will be talking about God know when Buddha is telling he is telling the truth when Jesus is telling is telling the truth because they have realized God whatever it may be in one path but they are perfectly speaking about that / because they have travelled to that then Saddam occasion is giving an example and before that he says he who has seen God knows really and truly that God as form and that he is formless as well he has many other aspect the cannot be described and this is real teasin atheism the moment we say God is only in this form that is atheism they don't believe in God i went to a temple they had many many rooms a huge they newly purchased a church and then transfer it so our small group of devotees of sri ramakrishna they wanted a room where they like to meet once in a week they tour if your God is this then only you are allowed otherwise no remember to your Hindus we are coming here into now Hindu only this God is the truth otherwise not then he said SRAM eg if you like you can take a cup of tea with our cycling and I have no problem so I can go and take the T so that the thing is I never tried to tell him because he is so much egoistic and he thinks he have all understood it no very very wrong the moment we say this much is God and nothing else you are disbelieving God's power all-powerful God all-pervading God it can take any shape it can go anywhere were you to say that God cannot go over there so that is blasphemy that is actually against God Sosa Ramakrishna said and then immediately as his owned he is giving an example once some blind men chance to come near an animal that someone told them was an elephant they were asked what the elephant was like the blind men began to feel its body one of them said the elephant was like a pillar he had touched only he it's Lake another said is like a fan he has touched only its ear in this way the other having test is still or Billy gave their different versions of the elephant just so a man who has seen only one aspect of God limits God to that alone it is his conviction that God cannot be anything else the one who touched the tail he told is just like a small little rope with nothing else the elephant but he's convinced that elephant is like this why because it touched that only so this is the narrowness so that is why I strongly be wakin on there who is to end a lot of argument with ceramic ISNA in the beginning when he was young man when afterwards himself realized everything then he said it is better to born in a church not to die there it is better to grow in an ideology some ideas but don't die that that is the only thing and nothing else it is not so that each and every one is having their own ideas they're traveling we have to see whether they're really good people are not if they're really good people consider it and helping others thinking about others they are following the right path and how can you say he is now asking to that the Vaishnava that the only truth about God that he has for it is undoubtedly true that God comes down to earth in the human form salam o Krishna is a green God can come in the human form as in the case of Krishna and it is true well through as well that God reveals himself to his devotees in various forms there are some stories that the Krishna and look Lakshmi they were sitting and when they saw the gonna wanna is coming immediately Krishna told Lakshmi you take the form of Sita I am taking the form of Rama then the other why he knows that we are your Krishna and I and he knows that Rama and Krishna the same but the Krishna said he likes to see Rama that's why we should have this rama and hanuman say yes I know both are same but my own dearest love is for Rama Sri Dante Janaki naughty aveda / am ahad money 3 notta and Jonna t3 means Lakshmi and hard not a husband is the Vishnu Janaki Sita her husband Rama I know both are same three naughty Janaki naughty aveda ramat money Momo service SIA Rama Kamala Luciana but for me rom is the best so that is a special type of love for one aspect of God nothing wrong in it and it should be otherwise we won't be able to move some people they come today here today there the energy is flittering today meditating on the Ganesha next day meditating on the car tkm NXT meditating on durga so like this is going on experiment is nothing wrong but energy splitting concentration means you have to put your mind in one place but that doesn't mean when the moment I am putting my mind in one place that is the only thing and nothing else and my human mind is very narrow and it likes to be narrow this is very peculiar and we have to break that that's why shahmeer awaken the sale each soul potentially divine goal is to manifest this divinity within how by controlling nature external internal this internal nature always wants us to behave like these these the oh no you don't touch them no you don't do this we won't do that and we have to judge why should you not what is the harm in doing it and then the moment we are judging slowly your understanding this is nothing wrong in it mind is becoming broad it can accept everything but at the same time stick to that one particular goal that I am going to pursue and i am going to achieve this is the main teaching of ceramic ish nuh and again he is telling do you know what I mean sachidananda is like an infinite ocean intense cold freezes the water into ice the next Island example and no one else before ceramic ISNA could give it that any that formless can take the form and the wit form can become formless and that is the speciality of Hinduism wherever I go whenever they invite me to speak in the Hindu temple i only talk about only one object I mean subject that Hinduism know Hinduism because most of us we do not know so when we come away from home we become more rigid about our own religion and all whatever we heart whatever you saw whatever you have read over that we are sitting now no no no this is the religion and I saw the people they are doing like that why they did we don't know but this you must do so this is very peculiar I told you one person he invited actually not he's how somebody else house but he was there the moment we entered some 23 bongs and he asked us to stand over there and then asking others to offer pronoun but the Sun was very scorching Sun was directed why was Denny and after such a long travel why there are seats are there let us say it and then you can offer for now no no no the moment a holy person enter he should stand over here facing this east and the chairs are over there facing the only south you cannot we cannot offer pranaam to you I told in that case excuse me you need not to work any program to me you do so this is the very peculiar idea it is the east and west the god we need me that you are going to offer program isn't it if that is so God is everywhere so you can offer pronounced God anywhere have that idea somewhere it hard and people are so very interested the moment you say something narrow they like it to follow and if you are telling something brought immediately even the scientist also are hesitant is it but they told like this so this is we have to break why because Swamiji said by controlling nature internal and external this internal nature always makes us narrow minded and the moment you become narrow we cannot reach to God so this is what he says and giving an a wonderful example first example he said about the blind people explaining about the elephant that is also true one person is telling this is God another person's telling this is God everything is true because they have realized God up to that Xiaomi become afterwards explained this in a different way he said one person standing on art looking at the sky and seeing the Sun giving the description of the Sun is perfect he is correct in his point another went travelling flying by the year aerocraft and aeroplanes from there looking at the Sun and giving the example giving the description he is also correct and someone who is travelling by the rocket and going near to and then giving is also correct all our correct but according to their standards there is here also see Ramakrishna say the all blind people they were explaining giving the description of the ill offenders also true but according to their realizations here he is explaining that formless can become form and form can become formless at the same time how shequida ananda such cheat arnhem that is brahman and it is vast everywhere it's like an infinite ocean example he is giving intense cold freezes the water into ice which floats on the ocean in blocks of various forms likewise through the cooling influence of bhakti one sees form of God in the ocean of the absolute excellent way is explaining I like to see God as a small baby who is playing making pranks and I am loving I am chasing I am feeding but is I one and gods comes to me in that form that's also true and when a cruller came a career was a gani and he was when he saw that all the the brindavan women are crying but the krishna has gone away so he came over you are crying Krishna is everywhere do you think Krishna is in this form Krishna actually Vishnu which is everywhere that will you take it your knowledge with you we like to see Krishna in this form only and then another story is there they went all the way from brindavan to mathura now let's call dwarka all the way they traveled from brindavan to dwarka to see Krishna Krishna was the King over there he was sitting on the throne and the with the Kings at have been they were covering their face what happened now we cannot look at this type of ordinal different people we are not supposed the he is Krishna maybe but we don't like this Krishna what do you want only our brindavan Krishna so this is the devotion and nothing wrong in it but don't say brindavan Krishna is different and mathura Krishna is different dwarka Krishna is different and Mahabharata Krishna is different no it is not the same Krishna in different form whatever you like you like so cinema Krishna is giving this idea that win on earth water becoming taking the form for the eyes form different forms floating on the water similarly the devotees bhakti that influences this and God is taking different form in the ocean of absolute these forms of melt meant for the buckler's the lovers of God but he says when the son of knowledge rises it ice melts it becomes the same water as it to have before the moment that knowledge Don's how can God be only in this form then everything goes away it becomes formless the form becomes formless in the bhagavata it is telling like this o lord thou hast form and thou art also formless in the bhagavata the main broke of the bush novels how many are sincerely reading and accepting this is the problem so they become so narrow in the bhagavata it says Lord thou hast for and thou art also formless I went to see how the Vishnu was the Lee when the practice etc in one place then one priest he saw me the ten I was brahmacari so he went to two I was curious I wanted to learn and then he saw me and immediately understood that I have joined in the ramakrishna mission and he was telling bluntly you know no cuts even oh you have joined in that you will go to hell look at it the narrowness unfathomable madness so to how they can say like that where he is he doesn't know I don't bother but he shared that some other people will go so that is the narrowness the way they are expressing at least some courtesy some gentleness you can of course a about your own path see I have followed I am following this part because this is this disease good qualities but about you know they don't have that mind also so this is the problem in the bhagavata itself it says o lord thou hast firm and thou art formless the work is before us O Lord in the shape of a man again thou has been described in the beador's as beyond words and thought but you may say that the certain devotees God assumes eternal forms so sometimes some people like Mira Y for her she cannot think of anything else except Krishna marry together along I only love grid re-do Salonika way for them they are so much devoted and they are not narrow-minded they only mention about themselves mirabai she is telling I only love I don't know whether you like it or not whether you have formed following other paths are not that is up to you but for me this is this what is wrong in it so cinema Krishna appreciating this and he is telling again an example there are places in the ocean where the eyes doesn't melt at all in the North Pole eyes is not melting of course now it is a little bit now this is what and then kadar he was a very knowledgeable person he used to read this in those days the people this to read lot of books the Kedah the devotee many again and again this name is coming in this book and this Gator is telling this one book by Xiaomi chetan anand the G that the devotees who lived with God to see Ramakrishna about the biography the very beautiful book and this biographies actually inspires us how these ordinary people seemingly outwardly ordinary people they are coming asking question living with Ramakrishna learning from him and then transforming slowly kedar is telling it is said in the bhagavata that biasa and the bhagavata itself the piazza ask God's forgiveness for his three transgressions and he says rupam rubaba Birgitta xia ba vato they are Nina ethical pitam I am meditating on a form well I know that you are formless there is the transgression the power that I have done oh god please forgive me I know that you are formless you were everywhere but I have formed I have thought a form of yours and I am meditating on that o lord thou art formless but I had thought of thee in my meditation as endowed with four rupam means for Rupa Bieber Jocasta without form baba to you they are Nina in meditation yet culpa thumb I imagined then second to talk I have chanted your name and telling so many good qualities dowered beyond speech but I have sung by Eames there is another transgression the V Asha is stealing studt wha the heems I am chanting Oh near virginia Tom ocular bro I know you cannot be explained you cannot be expressed in my words it is impossible even then I am chanting so that is the transgression bap it one chair near our kratom bhagavata you are all everywhere beautifully it says the all-pervading spirit but i have made pilgrim innit pilgrimages to sacred places i am going to do separate places as a pilgrimage thinking that this is not holy place so i am leaving this place going to some other place only to see why you are all pervading that is also transgression papam that I have committed and it says be happy launcher you are all / happy repertoire the victim is all-pervading near algorithm you don't have any form bhagavata oh my god but again I am such a fool your tilter yatra ah Dina and I have gone to the pilgrimages why should i why can't I sit and meditate on you who are all pervading but I could not because that is my limitations but Shunta bemidji odisha oh my lord Oh jagat Aisha Jared Isha Jarrett means the universe is not only the world the universe and Asia means God jagged iam you are the lord of the whole universe please forgive me that the beef allotted usha 3 m3 means 3 this type of shortcomings in me three shortcomings madam I have done I have committed please forgive me in the Bhagavad it is the biography of Shri Krishna and their these words Bhagavad is full of knowledge but a personal God that is the speciality a personal god Krishna about the Krishna they are explaining but every pages there containing adwaita knowledge but even then we are fighting and those people they claim narrow-minded people bhagavata is only for the boys neighbors which never the bush neighbors what is this then so this is all-pervading that's why salam o Krishna is telling then immediately see Rama Krishna is very happy and he is telling yes and he's stressing you know that the very good master he wants to impress this idea whatever idea that he wants to give again and again in different way he will repeat so that it comes within the mind and he is impressing the years God has form and he is formless to why he is talking like this because even today but at the his times Ramakrishna's time Hinduism was breaking because a lot of propaganda was going on against and mainly they were telling that God cannot have formed the God is all-pervading how the meaning God can come into a form the moment within the form it is limited the moment it is limited it is going to break going to die going to an end it must be a name because it is limited so finite and infinite the moment it is infinite it is permanent the moment it is becoming finite limited is going to break going to die going to stop going to a name so obviously God can never be so that was the argument here we find ceramic ISNA is breaking that our Brahmo Samaj prarthana Samaj and so many samajis groups they came that time only on this point and even today people are confused about seeing the hume hindus worshiping so many gods and goddesses but one point though they are confused but one thing they are very happy most of our foreign friends those who are not acquainted with the Hinduism majority of the Hindus as because they have grown up in that didn't mind and they are not sincere about it also for dame the krishna and the Ganesha and the Durga and the Rama all same you will go and watch him best not much but some people are very sincere if so many gods and goddesses whom I am going to watch it that is the question so therefore beam only this is the thing God is with form and with the outfall and for all the Hindus now everywhere a revival has come but we have to understand the real in tourism otherwise we'll make a mistake I feel like reading out this small page when you will go to Parliament of religion of course I don't know how many other people will come maybe some few of our devotees are going because they may be before us but still these are the gem of the the teachings about religion follow your own path sincerely diligently you must follow and try to realize God but don't blame others know for sure that those are also correct paths the moment you are going to think and explaining and propagating that that is bad immediately you are going away from the path of God so that is what salam o Krishna is mentioning when he was telling coating from the bhagavata he said yes God has formed and he's promised to farther again he is adding he is beyond both form and formless no one can we meet him so look at it and that is why see Rama Krishna is accepted by each and every one no one can limit him form formless beyond it we do not know the shabu da stotra in natural pradesh you know the all tribal boys win the dash Avatara so when the pig God is coming and all people because this actually go for hunting the pigs inside the jungle and the peak in all the they were very happy then other monks were telling is why we should do this because they may misunderstand we had to tell them what is it actually the God can mean that big why not in that cow why not we cannot limit God's power is beyond limitations unless and until you have this faith you are not a believer the believer of God always should understand this the I understood God only in this form that is sufficient for me see Ramakrishna is telling if only you need glass full of water why you are incredible the whole oceans water you don't need that you would understand that you won't be able to hold that so one glass of water is sufficient for you drink it and be satisfied so this is God is savvy some people will be always inquiring ceramic rishni in one place he mentioned that i will be coming again and to the north eastern side something like that everybody we are after 100 years so the 100 years is over as he come so how I can I to know he has not informed me and that is not in the Google to of compacting no but the thing is whatever he has given in this form as the Ramakrishna sufficient for me and much more that I can grasp that can get much more why should I need so many things is not necessary so for a human being we have to understand divinity is there within us and that divinity is known as God and that divinity is nothing but pure love unselfish love and unless and until we understand that in reality realize that there is no peace for me and for that piece but that happiness eternal happiness eternal bliss I must strive how I should strike whichever path I feel like traveling nothing wrong in it ramakrishna mission if you come you'll see so many varieties of show me's some will be only speaking about Shankar Acharya and they will tell you don't go anywhere else unleash ankara rom confusion zombies and son will be arguing vicious todita wish that data reads from isa ramakrishna you will see if he is nothing but we should stop tweeting and you people are only am easily we're translating it and thinking that is Shankara nothing jankura is vicious the date there are also some technicians are some people cannot think of meditating without the picture of see Ramakrishna worshipping every day one of our Swami's he was there he was posted in someone a stoma where there is no worship not even a picture of the Ramakrishna is worship but he has grown up in that atmosphere every evening when the sun is setting kundan above on the night I can't seem I cannot sleep so you know he used to take the photo of cinema Krishna and his to walk out of the campus and it is almost five to six kilometre after that is a huge area and he will cross beyond that our Ramakrishna a summer boundary then he will sit under a tree he will put tacos photo and insensate econ Donovan the nylon and then again he will pack up and come back and this is the speciality of gravitation and if you go you will see at the point when the Salam occasional worship is going on in our headquarters balloon mod on that day we are worshipping Jesus we are worshiping our hazard mammoth or Hindu Swami's they are reading from the quran reading from the bible reading from
