the hook automaton dr. G venom go be hidden Calma sharpen Shravana Mangalam three Martin Bobby green and de Buddha dodging aha the province Saddam vishna he is having the dialogue with the devotees and it was the time of the Durga Puja the great festival and we were reading from the page 561 of the gospel of Salaam tishner and he saved live in the world like a minute maidservant and before that he said never mind one can hear is God in the world - so this is a great statement always it is saying that you have to renounce otherwise we never realized God because God and the world are completely two different things just like light and darkness there isn't Abaddon that they always say like that how come everyone's around businesses that you can realize God while living in the world here the divine and world that completely two different different things the divine is a real world is unreal Devine is peace and happiness word is conflicting so just like the light and the darkness however once around Easter could say that you can realize God by living in the world so then is explaining he said that if only one is sincere now I read the whole statement again never mind one can realize God in the war too if only one is sincere I am mine that is ignorance but Oh God Dow and dime that is knowledge now he keeps that and again he will be explaining if he sings here he said that wherever you are you can realize God if you are sincere now what does it mean by these simple words sincere what is this insanity absolute faith in the existence of God there is the first thing absolute faith in the existence of God and second on interrupting practice to realize God so these are the two things if it comes together then only it is called sincerity if you are sincere anybody where you can realize God but sincerity means I am going to realize God that means I should have the complete faith in the existence of God and second on interrupted practice what type of practice selamat each dimension leaving the world like a maidservant in a rich man's house he is giving the details that to impress the mind to understand and he in different places he say live like a dry leave the dry leave it is falling from the tree then according to the wind whichever way it is blowing with it is getting by that for him but for that dry live and nothing is permanent it'll go wherever the wind will take it so depend on the will of God wherever the God takes you sometimes you are happy sometimes unhappy but should not be affected by anything there is second he seems like a talk to boys the taught wise they will when they're given the a in one place then they go to the water but constantly keep the mind over the already kept the egg where she kept it egg then you'll come back to that or like a kitten the small kitten and it's always very where it is but if the mother cat will take that it will go no choice for it so that means you have to completely depend on the God's will so that is the way only one can realize God when he is in that world and he is mentioning that it details in giving and wonderfully the picture is so clear this maidservant she performs all the household duties bring up our masters child and speaks to him as my worry but in her heart she knows quite well that neither the house or the chai belongs to her she performs all our duties but just the same her mind dwells on the meeting place likewise to your worldly duties but fix your mind on God and know that house family and son do not belong to you there cause you are only his servant now friend dc's the condition if anyone wants to realize God from the household this is the condition and you know that just recently last weekend we completed our third spiritual retreat in Ganges then one lady came and told can you please taylors explain that there is a group so they are interested that they were telling asking can you please tell me what about this Barnabas you know that in the Bhagavata itself may be in the next Sunday will be discussing about that particular portion where the God is creating the different chart is Brahman agia triada caste and also the awesomest brahmacarya goddess say Exeter bonnet cluster is a soma is a condition of life and in the indian mind they always think they understand this - but about the bond a person sannyasa a little bit confusion does it mean I have to leave everything so she wanted to know about the panel Christine this is the bond of pristine mentality living in the world but not of the world working for the world but not of the world all the time thinking that I'm completely different this is really challenge and that is the secret to realize God while living in the house apparently people will never understand but your attitude you implement you thinking all very subtly inside the mind constantly is going to ask are attached to in car thinking of God and God and nothing else and what will happen this second he will come slowly I asked people to I I ask people to renounce mentally first he say see how he is taking first he said you one can realize God while in the household as a completely different very challenging statement because of all the tradition of the Hindus and all others also they see no you cannot realize God jihad come down along when there is desire there is no God jihad on the honey gone and there is God there cannot be any worldly desire so obviously this is an age-old decision and advices house additional business saying is completely different way now he is a great master they feel now say if you like to realize God here too renounce the world people said no it's not possible Nana welcome so he's repeating the mind slowly and he says no whatever you are doing it's okay you must be there whatever you like he'll do only me now he begins it only only don't get a test give the mind to God how I am in this world working like a maidservant this house this family is all nothing belongs to me see when someone is getting a job in the office but this is my office all the time a card is hanging this is our then suddenly one day they say you are fired for no reason America is a free country they can hire they can fire on you so you know no more next thing you have to put that card off and you to search for something else maybe you will get a job in the company which is completely to that another completely different from the first one and even sings it to second company again now it goes the light goes in that way if you think in this way the world does belong to us and I love a person are these and then we get married then we are not going together so go to the code and divorce again again it goes in this wheel is is only again and again we realizing experiencing birth we do not understand only this attitude unattached attitude can help me while living in this world understanding this everything is temporary so living in a nice happy way I can have a scar so that is what other ones around is the teachers over here and today this topic is really really not only interesting but very important I asked people to renounce humanitarian this is the second better he said I do not ask them to give up the world I do not ask them to give up the world if one leaves in the world unattached and seeks God with sincerity then one is able to attain he H capital connecting him the God how sincere and Anna does this too that's all sincere means having the complete faith in existence of God and uninterrupted practices to realize God and in the practices what is there unattached I don't belong to this world I do everything and then nothing I have in America I really like people the woman summer comes immediately to prepare for the garden and the fruits are coming the flowers and then after few months slowly gloomy in the snow and all those things people are also not unhappy whatever the that cultivation everything we have harvested everything is over now thank you waiting for the sunny day again the problem the same way in the human mind also no problem for me and how it is possible in the thoughts and danger we'll find he is telling that there was a time when my dude meditate on God with my eyes closed friends we have to attentively understand this simple sentences only few sentences but that is the gist of the religion there was a time when I too would meditate on God with my eyes closed then I said to myself does God exist only when I think of it with my eyes closed look at it eyes closed means we tried all the senses from the same subjects those who are understanding the Hindu philosophy you know these five organs it goes out to five objects Rupa Russia chapter special Gundam and I close my eyes means what other also the ear the nose that Durga tan I closed all the spine which is the sources of collecting information from the world that knows all that and then where I send my thoughts my mind to God only most time the people they are bad for that white because so much of in the mind each and everyone if the doctors they can put that machine they can see it is just jumping like this so whatever different type of minds they have explained in this last retreat one of our Martha T's were explaining that to the mind is jumping and stopped her then sometimes it is just dull like this like it it goes the poor condition and in these condition and we train my mind get a little peace and the modern society people are bad for meditation everywhere meditation everywhere why because so much of suffering in the mind I cannot control my mind so this is one condition we must try to be taught by them when a person is advancing in the spiritual life this is the statement but one saddam additional disclosing when you have advanced in spiritual life the thing that you were doing now undo it there was a time when i to see ramakrishna do would meditate on God with closed eyes then I said to myself dance God exists only when I think of him with my eyes closed doesn't he exist when I look around with my eyes open this is religion ality now previous all other things the practices of religion but this is spirituality what is the spirituality I see God in everything seeing God in everything except God there is nothing so that is a ultimately called spirituality so he is sitting like that in if you go and some of the initiative says that switch to our study vovinam Brava shot the God created this phenomena the world everything then he entered into it as if otherwise is nothing but if the consciousness is not there how it will survive say everything having that consciousness and some time consciousness a palpable you can understand you can see he can feel like the animals the bars the best is the human being they can think they can wonder they can discriminate and they can meditate this is the only human being can meditate sometimes some people will say that great hanuman of the Hindus as a in the typically see that he is a animal like the monkeys no he is not he's a great yogi only used to dress like that that was the four time traditions the different tribes they used to take one type of animals of Birds even among the local people also here in America you tried that sometimes the power sometimes these are dad so they accepted that particular and became a clan Hanuman so whatever only human being control the mind now this is the highest condition now after controlling the mind then is opening the eyes to see that what I see what I realized inside my heart it existed outside God's everywhere the when I close my eyes and see that God within my heart and sometimes some people can control the mind and see their heart light it and that chosen date is sitting over there people are so happy they don't like to open their eyes their to go deep and deep into meditation but that is not the end of it then they open up and see God in everything and that is why the venetie says he showers shamela miserable yet danger Jared daun Gillette Asia Marshall covered the whole universe with the existence of the god the consciousness everywhere that consciousness that God now think of the difference when I'm sitting over here closing my eyes and getting a little you after God and I am so happy that if I gave that particular happiness the joy in every moment of my life every moment of my life imagine that whatever you see you here my god and in a beautiful slow kites Taylor and it says whatever the sound that you hear is nothing but the god the own God whatever song and in update particularly the tantrics dimension and when we were going to the city going around to different places think that he were surrounding actually the holiest of the holy shrine and whatever you were eating think that you are getting the brush Charlotte when you are sleeping thing that you are sleeping on the lack of the Divine Mother that means what every moment of your life so when we practice spirituality we consider only morning and evening but that is only the beginning then it go grows grows grows grows only dutiful you study one the young lady she rang me and just in a conversation she told when I go to my bed before that I take the chopper to Joppa then after that suddenly when I in the midnight when the slave row I heard that that mantra is going on I know deputy but inside my mind the monthly is repeating so I congratulated her that is a very advanced age that even stage now you have to hold it constantly then the one after of the stages will come then there will be lights they may be joy and the people will appreciate you people will come and touch your feet will be respect then along with that coming in Maya and will give you a lot of ego way I am the earlier turned down I am Julio did bust and again you go back to square one start from there so one must be very very careful the advances in this life is very sleepily bad so it seems that you were working on in the Raiders age and it is very long you do not know when he's going to stop but enable mistakingly find joy if you're sincere again to saddam additional i must say when he sees it is called grandma of piazza the terminology abuse means practice of art drama the greater body that it values they're really simple they will come they will do the oddity of our food and pray and cry and take the name of God there's a parish the practicing if you go to any bush Nava and they'll be singing for four or five times filtered in the morning and the second time again at any level then before the lunch and again after noting in the evening whatever items so I went and spent some time with them and found that is their routine if you go to the bed hunting the five times they're meditating early morning they will get up and they will meditate then they will go out for some food again they come they offer that food to the Supreme Lord and the meditate after again when they after the they rested they will get up again meditate again in the evening they will meditate before going to bed evaporated all the time Yogi's but those who are practicing the Vedanta Brahma or Piazza they are practicing the brahman in everything how they will do sadhana business mentioning Damas God exists only when I think of him with my eyes closed doesn't he exists when I look around with my eyes open now when I look around with my eyes open I see that God dwells in all beings he is the inviting spirit of all main animals and other living beings trees and plants Sun and Moon land and water but this isn't is he decent means everything no place is unholy everything is only everything so this is Hinduism when you are practicing this this is called Brahma of Piazza when you are pouring you're standing below that and taking the bath and water is falling down pouring on your head and you if you think that I am promoting water of the Shiva a humdrum Mars beyond the Shiva Shiva I'm now worshiping the ship of painting the seagull cleaning the Siebel your body but you are thinking that this is nothing but the Shiva free from everything our values this is control mark Piazza before taking the food he imagined the food and the hand that is taking the food from the plate the plate and the mouth that is eating everything is nothing but the problem so this is called from mafias Rahman vinamra movie it goes and many of our devotees they are very much fun that to learn this particular and every happy in a house is also to practice but you have to understand this is the rule of Brahma Piazza you are thinking that round each the mission before in the hostels when they take the food serving the food and you ask the students to wait then someone the leader he will go and start Ramayana all are supposed to say the brahma Hana then start otherwise another 167 600 700 people there taking some is finished and some was starting to make keep that term a discipline that we impose this some of the voids they don't understand what the words are but you have to practice because that is the system so they [Music] we're now with the sound and you cannot distinguish Julie say God Oh Ian things too you are supposed to close your eyes and fold your hands and say and in that condition they would simply keeps them going on some making some sound well they know the who is going to understand the word on what I am doing as a warden I used to go there's the water stream that is early if you observed that there is a he's not actually from Aharon of the lips manure now he's only little open and moves on something they will disclose to him from the back I heard then everything is over he was very happy you want to touch the food Adelaide can you please repeat the first sentence then I don't okay tomorrow I like to hear that you can pronounce properly so this is all the time goes on just repeating on do this is the highest practice you know it is from Martin Brahma be there's a Brahma appears and the highest practice even the food when you are hungry the food is there before the hell you were thinking and the Brahman this food is also drama pretty is Ludman it's a strong business selling and now when I look around with my eyes open I see God dwells in all beings he is the indwelling spirit of all is the body now in twenty spirit of all this is the important words Siham epistle never ever made any false statement any mistake in anything this is the speciality the philosophers could not find a lean forward in him even the secretary mentioning something to someone else Domino jockeying and he told know why Shankara is mentioning this thing explaining in this way should be in this record between Salaam business speaking none of the other philosophers could find out any mistake not only that all the present is preachers all of them they are using the expressions and the words of Slava Tichenor but unfortunately without recognizing that many of them most of them utilizing using this idea nothing wrong I give to spread it that's the height of thing the Swami Vivekanand about the name of ceramic dish 'no much afterwards only when he became very familiar then you say about my gurus and devotees they were asking him so he gave a lecture but on salam occasion is not the person and look at other people only the person is very important if the person is not there no he knows rock guitar why because they are depending on that particular person the person is holding the last in the left hand all the followers will pour the glass in the left hand the person is keeping some beard all the followership and that is all the followership this is our top mantissa I love that person's okay this is my guru not the problem but the philosophy should be understood properly otherwise nothing can continue the one person there is Matic behavior character and people gather around him is a very good speaker and then our people they come they donate and huge institution they Victor and afterwards when that particular person gone then what happens to that so they don't understand these is the philosophy is the ideology that should be continuously practiced a person who has practiced those philosophies in his own life and propagated bellow that should be the ideology will follow him but his eternal should be followed so this sometimes people do not understand they go for the person and person is only for temporarily so this should have a business telling I see God everywhere white basics Shiva Shiva is one of the leaders of the promised he never it seems never like Saddam additional see sometimes I all say from here that how we will know a person is spiritual the two things will obviously be daring is directed one no Janus data and secondly now for the sun's there is the selfishness the white no question of jealousy I know this world is very temporary somebody is giving these and that why should I be jealous nothing we should I should not there's the first quality see some Krishna was so happy she Boonen he was a completely different the religious path that he was falling Brahmo Samaj this to criticize the traditional induce this Duty decides even saddam krishna as because he was following the traditional in reason not without understanding empowering salaam business - loving salam addition is to go to that person know why now he's explaining why do I seek Shiva not now we should listen it very carefully he would meditate some God for many days has substance in he has divine power in him this is sometimes when we are meditating you would find this even someone in your family who is meditating and little the bend of mind for the spirituality other family members will respect him or her so this is the thing why when you are meditating for a long long time many many years and now what is this meditation and here I was trying to understand it myself the God loved those who meditate on God the meditation means we drawing the mind from the sense objects and concentrating one God first second when the mind is focused on God the object it adopts the qualities of that object second step and meditation and God slowly transform the meditator he took that godly qualities so God loves God only a nothing else God love God only and nothing else so this is the main world home service probable multa sunbong Robert study in the bhagavad-gita team chapter eight verse it says I am the origin of all from me everything evolves so except God nothing is there now the question you shall I go for the God's creation or for the God himself this is the choice before you if you choose the God then you become God and if you choose his creation for some days you will enjoy that creation the same thing was they enacted in the life of two persons or Juna and that is called the conga do yodel the trio Donna and Arjuna both of them did going to invite Krishna then the Krishna told both of you have come I have to give something to each of you okay now there is an option one side I will be here and I am going to fight only I'll be there with you there self and in another side highly-trained my soldiers over there thousands of them and the first option was given to Arjuna and to have dinner was purely thinking oh my god this is very bad of course it was a dream I had come fast I did should be the first option should be given to me thinking or Jinnah will take all the thousands very well-trained will around soldiers who is going to take this unknown person or to the neighbor saw Krishna as a person is raised a god himself or that is why afterwards in the bhagavad-gita we find Sri Krishna stealing I am Arjuna among the Pandavas the original was the part of Krishna / - they chose Krishna Krishna - but remember I am NOT going to fight for you and we're going to pick away near wayland in the warfare I'll be just with you okay drive your childhood that much I can do but you know I want you right through to Donna was very happy what a fool he has children and what happened ultimately it was proven that but Gina was the perfect person very correct so God has created this universe and then separated him from there and option has been given to the human being this is the challenge in the human life courses now the both are there I am here sitting correctly if you will come to me talk to me and if you go to me those who are choosing the world the suffering God see not doubt but God is not there God is separate from them so this is one servicer probable and the origin of all mater salva libertà D from me everything evolves the why a person meditating a long time on God attracting the gods mind because he is transforming himself she is transforming himself into godly hood so God loves God only so that is the topic of the today said sluggishness mentioning and he said is mentioning in this way further he who seems well pleased well has mastered in art has he in him real substance and the power of God this is the view of the bhagavad-gita and we find in the bhagavad-gita also taint chapter Oh God the on power is nothing and God sees a petitioner never read bhagavad-gita in that way but he knew the whole thing and in life time used interlacing and reminding us that if you go in the tain chapter Rahman is telling everything that you see the best everything vestiges would be some of the people they're so good in instrumental music or the vocal music of the dances are different things but problem is they think they're doing it so they suffer if they could think that God has made me the instrument to express that you'd have been elevated to the divinity this is the only difference there is a great actress should cheat her SHANY many of the Indian people they are hard should it crush me even today also the old cinema she was a really beautiful lady and how the acting was so natural normal even today if heart picture is coming with to thank mom then people won't go to any other movie they would all go to see that the time came she understood the my pivot is slowly going away and I won't be able to do her that term the people with that physical beauty she retired she needs the time when to retire returned to the decision from the ramakrishna mission and the district that wishes to go and meditate in the old shrine of the Belmont and you go and sit with a relative Swami's to discuss about the spirituality years together heroes together once I made a gentleman a lawyer she was living in the same building the gentleman would like to see hard as our name should shift regime and registration directors yes she'll be coming to meet me you know what happened such attrition came the moment he saw me I was a young mom she came and immediately bowed down and to heaven coming from a guru suppose she ever knew me and I was much younger than her Eve you are coming from my gurus house she said and touched at my feet and she was cleaning that the chair where I was sitting proceed now please do this and she was thinking how to serve me that much of love for not the person but I do love all of the life never came out the game and then when she passed away thousands of people thronged over there now not as an actress but as a spiritual personality sister how she elevated into that whatever the beauty the God gave me are utilized for the service then also the qualities I dedicate to God whatever the cause sighs I mean so this is what is called the practice of Vedanta in the bhagavad-gita and also in the Chinese in the Jandy and find the 5th chapter 55 verse selamat ish dimensioning here yadi we set up a booth issue commonly ruby in assam most economists - main domestic me nervous - maemunah ma cantaloupe in a beauty and sometimes some people are so beautiful why the past life they got their beauty so even that is also the manifestation of the God through that beautiful body and that beautiful mind everything which ever received the best only it should go in the credit of God if one can constantly feeling that way then there's no problem but ever he or she is in whatever the responsibility in the worldly life for sure they are going to realize the car then Saddam additional mentioning about the person and he said that Gita as a gentleman was a very devoted Houston I have Gita is so good and he has beautiful nature that the pitcher Krishna Goswami he said at Dhaka he's constantly talking about you he is always eager to see you now in the bhagavad-gita again we find the circus nice telling the devotees at those who are exchanging here they're expressing only about me to each other they are talking about me too with each other and then getting the joy so when to two devotees are meeting they always talk about have you heard about that team or ready tempo and the beautifully expression and this thing that if they'll be talking about that the more and more you talk about the spiritual thing more and more it goes down to your mind it's something over there in his conscious mind as it is there constantly you are thinking about that and getting the transformation so this what bhagavata-dharma fish to say then master Basha is giving the description he's leaving the house all devotees brahma devotees again and in a line they were touching the feet of Rama Krishna the ceramic dish never was at cannot even leave you GRE he was a devotee of Goddess Kali Brahman was never like this Kali but now we find that they understood that is the completely different personality so they all came to touch his feet now another description is giving Sunday September 28 1884 Salameh fish nails the others house other was a rich man he was in a very position working some questions to go to these people because they could have for other people also so the person who is within reach and having a big house Salam Krishnan is to go and all of the devotees also assemble over there and they could be accommodated into that house and the partner and also give them little refreshment so Saddam which needs to practice in that way and people together and he said two persons they were fighting with each other one is PGI another is Geeta but both of them days to the exit on business so the both of them came to meet Sam Houston there and sit on Krishna Hawks team to impress each other and to forgive the enemity and become friends again and he was very happy to see those people again just become friend if you have anything if you are not liking some person every time in your mind it will be all think about why he's here why she is there so it is printed to accept each and every one as friend he fits in this way drugs in this way but I don't have any problem with that your mind is free from that that is also one of the practices of the spirituality then the master measure is mentioning one thing not in the were seated in front of the master not the means on Tichenor their injuries afterwards Shami Vivekananda he was about 22 years old master she is giving the account of 1884 September and that time there Indra was 22 1886 Salam listener his body and then narendra took the sannyasa so at the age of 24 he took the sannyasa by this way you need a calculator while cinema krishna was talking dollars his eyes desserts very wonderful technology star Krishna was talking suddenly his eyes fell on this young boy upon his beloved disciple at once the master stood up and went into Samadhi because the Narendra himself at that time he was not aware about him but status nonunion the yesterday only we were just celebrating the TT puja of Ramakrishna Gandhiji used to love Salaam Krishna so much afterwards when he took the sannyasa that they gave the monastic name Ramakrishna London the one who feels joy in surround Islam when they were two brothers when both of them became to see Ramakrishna some Institute I saw you in the group of Jesus Christ 2,000 years before what happened and it was true that they really love Jesus and these two brothers afterwards both of them became sannyasi sorrel Ananda and Ramakrishna under the Pakistan very good in mathematics so both of them were very good students and these to study in a very famous College in Calcutta English medium college in those days and they became the Ahmadis to introduce Dean we do not even allowed not in the north was in the Scottish Church that was all sort of the Scottish people and this three became very close friend dish to go on talking about the God and sometimes it so happened that they came to visit narendra's house this year too young and Natori it is now evening let us let me go to see you off to some distance so they'll be begin we talking about God verse around vishna our spiritual life and all those do you reach to the distant destination of these two brothers then disturb others to see who now it is Doug you alone go back let us also know that was half the night will be going like that and he became so close friends at that at that time age was 20 22 years so this Sudama businessman telling them the moment he saw Vivekananda Narendra he stood up and went into Samadhi slowly his mind him and he was dealing such add-on and sadhana satchitananda and then we immediately say no it is the day of the Divine Mother was to me that was the Durga Puja did not succeed on and it is the day of the Divine Mother the giver of the Bliss of divine this please whole mother full of the Bliss of divine inebriation sorry gamma pardon me it is not good to keep the voice on the knee knee me is such a darling them all the time it is not possible to keep the mind so long I shall keep it on the next lower plane next to your plane when the Tsuchida and the such cheat on endure existence knowledge please that is the ultimate but mine should not be there it's not possible to be there so bring it down and see mother the greater our Drita then comes them there are different planes of consciousness I will conclude with this there are different planes of consciousness the clothes the certain the Casa and the great cause car - arena Sushma sridham stoller Challenger the same the mint - gross we can understand manifested - subtle at the back of it the way we are planning to perform something to do something we think about that make the program planning that is the subtle one and one we are doing it that is the Khalsa so now we are thinking that we will celebrate Durga Puja so why because the total puja that brings joy to the people and elevates in spirituality so the cause to perform the puja organize the puja is to elevate to the divinity trust the causal second the planning circle then the cross thing the people will come the devotees will offer food and we will offer flower and pooja will go so three stages that's constantly going on but we are only aware of the clothes and if we can understand the subtle and the cause things should be already solved so we will discuss about it maybe in our next discussion he
