[106. Panchama Veda 106:Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQdUVV0u0U)

good evening today we'll be discussing again the punch em away that the gospel of ceramic ich nur and the last time that we were ceramic ish namaz explaining something very subtle things so you repeat that again and you will continue so here let us start with that phenomena toluca Tom rhythm dr. G venom Kobe very ritam calma sharp ahom surana mangalam srimad otha Tom Boonen te URI dodgin ah this is a great words and in the bhagavata a very holy book of the Hindus it promises that eat these words not it's not mentioning about the gospel of ceramic ich nur is mentioning about the bhagavata the life of Sri Krishna if you read if you hear these words of the God then you get the merit so we are starting that but this time it is ceramic ishness wonderful words now last time we were discussing can one eva understand the work of God so that was the question and it ceramic ISNA was telling that he's so near still it is not possible for us to know him so near but not possible to and him is him is as if a male person it's not dad it is the Earthman but the same up men taking the form of god or goddess but just for the simple way to discuss simple way to make people understand we are using he or sometimes she or sometimes eat like this so here as because it is God personified so it is he he is so near still it is not possible for us to know him why that is the question why it is not possible then it becomes that question of the concept of Maya Maya a power of God a delusive power of God is constantly deluded our mind constantly deluding our mind and we are thinking that this is this this is that but which is actually in reality it is not only this much it is so near to us so close to us we can understand it but because of this God has covered all with his Maya ceramic ishness giving this explanation why we cannot God has covered all with his Maya now what is Maya as you cannot explain in words what is Brahman the similarly we cannot explain in words what is Maya this word Maya is impossible to explain shankaracharya is given some idea but it is only we can feel but you cannot explain it in words that is the thing ceramic is still God has covered all with his Maya he doesn't let us know anything Maya ease now he's giving a definition lost and greed Maya is lost and greed it's our desire is our lova greed is a lova the greed for what to enjoy these worldly things so what is these worldly things all those that are changing constantly so every time every year there's a graduation ceremony is going on in the universities and the young students they are so happy that we have become doctor engineer or these of that they'll be throwing their hats parents would be there all people enjoy every year it is happening same people after practicing the their profession for a long time in RVs and now we have to give it up why why this to become that we are striving for so many years and so attentively so diligently we when you get that we are so happy one young lady has st. a little video to me how she is getting there this doctor Dittmer certificates etc so this is very fascinating every year is happening but is it not Maya we understand that at the  end of our life oh that is nothing that is called Maya constantly not you before you also people and after you and after after after each and every one experiencing the same thing but still being diluted by this wonderful power of God so it is called Maya on explicable no one can explain it Sosa ramakrishna stilling it is covered with that he who puts Maya aside to see God can see him but then who can see God the answer again he is giving who can put aside the Maya but is it just so easy to put aside the Maya now grandfather told his son my father you should do this you should not do these etcetera same thing he was not liking all liking it was going went on same thing he told me I am Telling my junior one it going on and on this is a very peculiar thing when we understand it is late so that is the reason only handful very the people who are having really good luck having the impressions good impressions of their past but they only can understand from the childhood days and they can do like that cuoi quad cut to OMSI show Shankar Acharya asks the one young boy he was not talking at all but his parents we're naturally very unhappy that their son is not talking are not at all interested in this worldly life what had happened to him they brought to him to Shankar Acharya the moment he saw he understood is the great soul so he asks before everyone cut to OMSI show my child my son the boy who are you immediately the replay claim chillin on the roof of shivoham shivoham all these days he was not talking but that moment the Shankar Acharya asks that question he said I am the shiba the pure so that is the past life impression why he was quietly sitting and not doing anything not taking any interest in this so-called normal life because he knew that is going to bind him so these are very very rare type of people so we called the Maharaja but we can try how by taking the name of God constantly going to the holy people listening from them trying to understand it implementing those teachings in our life by that we can put aside these Maya so see Ramakrishna once when I was explaining God's action to someone God suddenly showed me the lake up kamat poker I saw a man removing the greens come and drinking the water the water was clean and crystal God revealed to me that she'd Ananda is covered by that Maya so the just a vision he saw and he interpreting the division in this way that God showed him what is that you need not to go to come up over here we have a small pond there you can see all is constantly covered and whenever there is a wind or the rain it goes goes out and then very really clean and clear water and that same thing in our mind what is that pond water mind our mind constantly so many different types of thoughts are coming and covering just like the scum and if you can remove it immediately in the mind itself it is so quiet and calm and clean mind so the reflection of the God can be seen over there so that is the idea but how to do that taking the name of God that's the only way and in the bhagavad-gita srikrishna stealing he who is taking the refuge in me I will help him to cross the Maya Maya may Tom Curran TT currently crossing as he option and I can help him to cross that ocean so ceramic ISNA got revealed to me that the tsuchida on the covered by the Maya he who pulls the green scum aside can drink the water let me tell you a very secret experience se llama Krishna he is explaining to master mache what is that secret once I had entered the wood near the pine grove and was sitting there when I had a vision of something like the hidden door of a chamber I couldn't see the inside of the chamber I tried to bore a hole in the door with a nail life but did not succeed as a bore the art fell back into the hole and filled it then suddenly I made a very big opening now as if the God is trying the Avatara is trying to see the whole thing and so that all can see it but is going on covering you cannot make the hole but it was open to him then suddenly I made a very big opening uttering these words the master remained silent after a time he said these are very profound words apparently it's so easy so simple so childlike but is so simple what is there there was a imagining a wall and trying to make a hole in it and it is covering all the time what is there something's but he is telling these are very profound words that means is it possible for someone to break this Maya the wall of Maya that is constantly covering and not allowing us to see the reality no you have to understand it yourself one can experience but cannot explain that is the thing one can experience it but cannot explain it sri ramakrishna was crying is hard to make it open for the ordinary people even but rhythm that's the word they say there's a law at the law is it should go and continue like these only it should move like these only there is no other way it's called rhythm the law of nature we can say and that Rita won't allow us though we want wealth but it's not possible physically you can't do it but the spiritual help is very difficult if no one can do that we have to help ourselves uttering these words master even side and after a time he said these are very profound words I feel as if someone were placing my mouth and the universe is conscious on account of consciousness of God certainly he is telling the word ultimate words of the punisher art monastic amariah sarvam Priam bhavati briana Felicia giving a full page atmos to kamiya at minus 2 comma like that because of the Hartman the consciousness everything may wide my husband the child the father the reality all these things the full account of it why again and again the same thing he is repeating in the breather and a Venetian to make it clear in our mind of impressed with in our mind each and everything is nothing but the manifestation because of the consciousness that is present in it otherwise it is not why I am loving my own body to curl artman is there why I am loving my wife my husband might and my family my everything because artman is their art monastic amaya sarvam Priam bhavati everything that we see is becomes real adorable lovable attractive because of the presence of the art Minh and what is that artman what is that consciousness that you have to realize following the words of the scripture and the Guru yourself no one can help the ceramic is nice telling sometimes I find that universe is saturated with the consciousness of God he is using the word God now this this is actually the consciousness othman Brahman these are the words that usually the began toured with the Vedanta particularly uses and the do 18 in the pedant itself that we turn Advaita this is there that do a thing they uses the word God ishwara etc here he says sometimes I find the universe is saturated with the consciousness of God as the art is soaked with water in rainy season giving an example everywhere water now the other day one lady our neighbor she came she's the devotee and she is helping us to grow some vegetables and requested to give little water so when they opened the water tab then suddenly started raining you needed to bother about that particular garden vegetable garden everywhere water and like that the consciousness the art man everywhere not in this particular thing that is the speciality of the he news we go to the temple and we are very careful that we should not put on the shoes we remove our shoes and we go barefoot but when you walk on the field when we were walking here and there each and every place is the same consciousness but why this temple then because at least in the beginning we know that this is a place where I should concentrate to realize God as a child is not ready to learn when in the playground but when the same child goes to school psychologically he knows I have to go and sit in the classroom I have to listen to my teacher I have to open my boo I have to take the notes that is the help of the school otherwise anywhere the child can learn we can also go and see God in any place but why the temple because of this that is the main reason the temple means this is a place where consciously am coming is a place of God the Temple thatchers the synagogue is a place of God I am consciously entering but it is saturated everywhere the all these have been said again and again almost in almost in all the Indian scriptures Hindu scriptures and this we find again in the words of bhagavan sri ramakrishna confirming that i feel find the universe saturated with the consciousness of God then he said upon my world i don't feel vanity even in the slightest degree I'm promising I don't find vanity why I have realized the truth so obviously when the cinema Krishna is expressing it may be that people may missile understand that o is just showing us he has seen God he has in consciousness saturated everywhere I don't know because we are not feeling it we are not understanding it there's every possibility to misunderstand the person who is demanding who is telling these Sosa Ramakrishna of course he is telling it to very close devotee three more master marche at least he should not misunderstand it this is chances of misunderstanding why because when I am Telling something to a person and he is not at all understanding it difficult for him or hard to conceive that idea there's a chances for misunderstanding that is the reasons the Ramakrishna is telling and he is promising upon my words I don't feel vanity even in the slightest degree now and then I think what is it I know that makes so many people come to me bushna boucheron was a great pundit he used to say to me I can find in the scripture all the things that you talk about but do you know why I come to you I come to hear them from your mouth because whatever they have written in the scripture that is only written over there but when we listen it hear it from the person who has realized it seen it understand it that is a different thing and that is why the people who have that realization when they say that carries weight so there are millions and books of their thousands and thousands of books almost every day people are writing so many different way but if we go on reading all those things will be totally confused in they call it shove djarum mijangam is like a great the forest and naturally inside that there is every possibility to lose the path I do not know where I'll go shut the Jhelum mehar onion cheat the brahmana car an art I go and read this book will great words wonderful lines they are only but they are only coming out from the tongue they don't know they have not realized what they are writing they have not seen it that is the difference when that is realized the same person maybe not in a very polite way not in him and a good language that he is using but still you would feel attracted so that is why the great pundit of there is a king so he's went it was that our bushna Bergeron and he came to meet cinema Krishna is to come it will early and why because he could hear those words from the mouths of realized person this vision which erin was a great person in those days and he is coming and accepting the words of the Ramakrishna was no certificate at all who has not read any Scripture at all how come that so as Ramakrishna himself is wondering as if why he is coming and listening to me when he himself with such a great scholar because it is the truth that has been realized and then it is saved then only reading in the book someone is just going on helping the students the geography class oh this is the Africa this is America disease did but a person who has visited those places he can in his through his word you can visualize see these are the places I went over there this happened that happened this type of people that type of so that way when a person has already visited his words carries the weight ceramic is nestling I know but do you know why I come here I come to hear them from your mouth all your words tally with the scriptures that is the main thing scripture means again scripture mean those words after realization it has been recorded so the people who have realized all those we call them Rishi we call them the respected people the great souls they realized that and then expressed it that has been recorded thousands and thousands years before same thing without reading without knowing another person on the same way expression that means these are truths the truth means always eternally the same thing and baby is a long long back one gentleman told milk of a cow is white now afterwards after many many generation again a person found yes the milk of a cow is white this is the truth never changing not changing because of the time not changing because of the people's experiences but is the same truth carrying on this is in the scripture the scripture means shastra and the sastra means the words of the realized Souls so this is very important M is also collaborating all your words tell you with the scripture navadeep Goswami also said that see Ramakrishna really and truly I have no pride no not even the slightest bit he is giving the certificate to himself to make people understand at least through aim the master mihashi I who came there is naturally very very natural to misunderstand because we are not having that suppose a person comes and say when i SAT for meditation I saw God what we you'll understand those who are not having any idea of God those who are practicing trying to realize God at least they will wonder listen to him touch his faith and ask for the blessings because of the devotion but those people who are not having any ABCD of the religion never practice it they will go out and say look at it all this fall's were they are telling to impress people so that they get some money and all these things will come because not having any idea so see ramakrishna again and again repeating to see more and telling that really and truly shakti will she really and truly i have no pride i am not having any ego no not even the slightest bit and again is giving the description they were going to a place salam o Krishna this is the uniqueness of the Ramakrishna that he was just as a modern time missionary he was not sitting in one place he was going house to house he was in a Calcutta so all the rich people educated people he used to visit them because if they are converted into this great ideology the philosophy that each and everything is nothing but the manifestation of the same God that will be easy for them to practice in their life and thousands of poor people illiterate people they'll be benefited if a rich man becomes generous donor he can help thousand people so that way ceramic is na was going to educated people to some extent rich people to German dars see Ramakrishna said to him dwell in the truth and you will certainly realize God a simple line dwell in the truth and he will realize God what is the truth what is that sit there that which never changes when you talk to the truth the memo and we say the truth that means what is it whatever is happening I am observing it and then narrating it if I am narrating to someone there's the truth not exaggerating not deleting anything I am exactly telling those things which I have happened before my eyes because that is the truth it's called truth and then holding the truth constantly what is that truth permanent Sathya when the sanskrit word sathya is used that means permanent i am telling the truth means constantly i am talking about God and my conception my thinking my everything is dedicated to God and I cannot go beyond that that is the truth SAT there so that truth is if we can hold on then see Ramakrishna selling to the more dwell in the truth and you will certainly realize God with great confidence he is telling because that is the only way if we can dwell on truth what is the trailing untruth this God is the only that is permanent all other things are impermanent so if I am constantly thinking on God naturally my mind would be withdrawn from all the objects of the world from all the objects of the world what are the objects we know the five objects usually we identify through our five senses Chuck chicana NASA cagiva talk when are we are identifying and withdrawing those senses thinking very clearly strongly with resolution that these are all temporary I am NOT going to be deluded by all this there's called sathya dwelling in such a means withdrawing all the senses and keeping the mind on the truth that is God that is Brahman that is something which permanent never changes Sri Ramakrishna sterling that you said the other day to Nevada goswami m-master Marsha is telling oh god I want the master mache whatever he understood and he was also a great soul and he is telling oh god I want thee please do not delude me we die world with switching Maya I want to realize thee this is called Satya not is such a god so the mossy ramakrishna some other day he told to never dip go show me another really high scholar burned eight scholar that you should pray constantly in this way and that he is leaving on truth that is sathya and maybe some other day we can discuss about the maybe in the next class I will try to quote from different Scripture what is sathya such a means the constantly keeping the mind on that particular truth but if i am telling the truth whatever has happened exactly that but by that others are being heart that is not SAT there maybe that whatever is truth if I say then a person is being hard one should not speak that so this way Sathya is he is also having the this thing qualities but here the sector means the master mature giving the hint it is actually that permanent one whom we call as God or Brahman serama Krishna is don't you lead here he has arrived yes one should be able to say that from ones innermost soul the prayer master Masha hard that ceramic ISNA Stillington about deep goswami he remembered that and repeated that before see ramakrishna salam o Krishna is telling yes one should be able to say that from ones innermost soul Oh God you are the only one from the innermost soul one should be able to tell it on one of our Swamiji when we turned the rom nom usually we say in the Stuber prarthana that o rama oh god you you can understand you can see my own self I don't have any desire except you that time is to keep quiet and why why don't you sing these lines but it's not true for me I have so many other thoughts are there the win I am Telling this to God that is not true set them Buddha Amitabha van a keylock mahatma you are leaving as the arm as a soul in the arts of aquila every 1 million millions and you're living in the hearts of everyone and you know that I don't have any desire Sathya magamit i am telling you the truth Oh God but it's not truth we go on telling that without considering what is the meaning of it and not very serious about that too but if we really sinks here you won't be able to otter those words because we have desires and only desire that we are not having that is the surama blessings of suzama chandra we are only singing that particular time and constantly watching the watch when the time is past we will go will be free all this thing so this is way it goes and here salam o Krishna with the moment the Masters sorry mom told that and ceramic is notorious but this is the way what you must be very very careful then they came to the ceramic rishni arrived others house and took a seat in the parlor in the living room nowadays a quality over here the living room it's a parlor so people is to sit over there to discuss almost every house it is having a separate special room where they can meet the outsiders meet the brains discuss the parlor talk in a Swami Vivekananda's lectures you will find many many parlor talks so I also go and when I give the name parlor talk they don't understand as ok living room talk so that will do so there's a parlor talk means in that place where people are invited but he known people frames and relatives may be a few neighbors become the seat and energy discussed this is very very effective when you go and give a lecture in big all few people they understand it but in a very close 25 20 people when you are discussing to they can ask question we can discuss they also can share their views very effective so salon kitchen is to go in that way constantly from this house to that house he has come to other but who is this other see this one or two lines other means a great devotee and he said Ramakrishna arrived at others house and took a seat in the power rock hall or nah Ramlal other and master master and the other devotees sat near him rachal rachal means afterwards swami brahmananda was staying with his father in Calcutta the knuckles actually original parental hull a little away from the Calcutta so that also has become a center of the ramakrishna mission now but these two come naturally the big city people they come so there is to come and that time his father was a landlord very rich man so he was living with his father in Calcutta master to other didn't you later are all know that I was coming that was the system of Macedon ok Krishna he used to send word to all known come come we'll go over here and there recently whenever I go to nape naperville Gita class usually there are two devotees I go and take the dinner over there and come whoever is with me they also come with me this time is because the long weekend it was many young people they came they are staying one or two the experience of the ramakrishna mission and they were all here now i cannot say no to them so i told the host see two person will come at me just ok then I told not to do it has increased it may be four is ok then RT ultimately it became 11 in total so I told some people are coming with me they told ok because i am not sure how many not the number is increasing but when we wing lot of food was there that is sufficient and apart from the food the discussion all becoming close and discussing about that keeping ideology before that is the joy that is called parlor c ramakrishna wanted that Rakhal though he is a rich man's son naturally if you don't invite and you won't come so it's not like so salam o Krishna told tell him that I want him to be here other understood the master was not very much pleased that the that boy was not there why because they are poor puresole say ramakrishna wanted to talk to them so that they can understand it better what does it mean by pure soul they were not having any desire for the worldly enjoyments that is the main thing a group of young people came I was telling that you are all intelligent young where didn't you become monks and nuns you are appreciating the monks and nuns Swamiji you have come from all the way from India staying here spreading the Indian messages actually yes you are appreciating me why yourself is not becoming no no no first I'll marry and then I will spread the message of religion and okay the second preference the first preference meant so this way when the young people come if they are really like our Vivekananda not in the North all that ceramic is not understood that they are not at all attest to the worldly things so he used to go on giving them indirect way in the beginning indirect way teachings of the agar and the idea of God liberation Mukti and all that so he was na a darshan understood finding that the master was eager to see Rock Hall other at once ain't his carriage to fetch him other had been yearning to see master that day but he had not definitely known that the Ramakrishna was coming ceramic is not came there is no fixed date that he will come there is to serve but other it was very much eager that I have not seen salam o Krishna for a long time and that is called divine love the other he was a deputy minute deputy lavishness do tell him deputy magistrate you you can imagine at the time of the British rule Indian has become a magistrate that was a big post and that person was so humble and used to love see Ramakrishna so much as because he could not go and visit the Duchy nature he was yearning to see him see ramakrishnan came to him and after coming he told bring them with this that and he was then he told I haven't been here for a long time I pray to God today that you might come other went to out for some work maybe so usually I prayed to God today that you might come I even shaped ears I was crying that I couldn't see you so that is the love do you really feel like that so these are the characteristics of the devotees I have not seen him for a long time anywhere every moment that God picture should be before me so here it was telling the one some other I think yesterday someone rang me and he was telling a someone was going on singing Gopala Gopala oh no go Paula came so but the song nobody liked because the singer was not having the devotion the singer was constantly thinking how to impress the audience that usually don't work devotion is a different thing the real love is a different thing so when they are crying for that then naturally God is bound to come and the presence of God is felt in the hearts of the devotees they will feel ya God is here something is good so feel the attraction to come to listen and after listening they become so happy so that is called devotee other was a real devotee you haven't been here for a long time I prayed to God today that you might come I even shed tears and master was pleased 3mon master marche who was recording he noticed it and he mentioned it why God is pleased why the devotee was crying for God now usually wherever the ceramic is now used to go someone is to sing he was very fond of the songs so the person who was there is relative that is Ramlal we know the ROM la da da his famous in the Ramakrishna family he sang a song and the last words about in the throat in the 16 petal lotus flower of smoky you within the petals of this flower the lies concealed a certain space transcending which one sees at length the universe in space dissolved in the song it is there a bengali song about goddess Kali master see Ramakrishna said to the M listen this is known as the vision of sha Chi dhanananda when the song was sang he understood the person who composed must have realized that such Eden and doe he was describing goddess Kali a personal goddess but actually ultimately the mentioning about the vision of shequida Nanda such chit Ananda together they pronounce it tsuchida Ananda searched on and what is that somehow the people have tried to explain about the Brahman is not actually the Brahman the indication about the Brahman such cheat on and what is that this that means existence it is always there without any change that his son cheat is knowledge full of knowledge complete knowledge and Ananda is a bleeze absolute so that is called such cheat Ananda and that is formless Brahman there are two types of Brahman one is with form another is weed out for why these two now we will come to this next line one attain the absolute by going beyond the universe and its created being conjured up by maya see the in the conclusion today's conclusion we can say we can one can go beyond this universe how because this is the maya if we can understand that then we can go beyond this and where you'll go we'll go to the absolute that is called Brahman Brahman is known as absolute Brahman is known as Atma Paramatma like this in different names by repeating home one goes beyond the nada and attained Samadhi the ohm ET Brahma in the benicia it says what is Brahman is that o mighty the word home that is brahmana why our mom that is called own this own is a symbol of Brahman when you are going on repeating that one gets that vision then there's a different type of talks are there here I found about that pedant it says most crucial problem of the Advaita Vedanta is to explain the coexistence of the two entirely different and incompatible entities now let us just read from the passage this is a wonderfully yet the writer has explained that two things are there again and again we come to that the Hindu philosophy the Hindu ideology the Hindu ultimate thing are the two thing what one is this existence that is called the world and another is at man consciousness brahman paramatma Atma so that is this to our totally different how to explain it how the darkness and the light are living together if this is not actually existing then how come the if Brahman is the true then we're from this world came the universe came with so many varieties nama and rupa the heat it explained like this Brahman and the world to two different complete in the bhagavad-gita it says Chaitra and chaitra byung and Braman and the world Brahman is infinite consciousness which is nil guna ninguna the sanskrit word means is not having any qualities needed wanna and what are those quality sucked arijit ama these three qualities the moment it is there immediately different type of creation begins so it is beyond and gunas ninguna absolutely devoid of all attributes what Brahman is cannot be expressed in words the upanishadic definition Brahman is truth Brahman is knowledge Brahman is infinity is only a symbolic indicator lakshana luxion amines indication symbolic indication not a true description it is impossible to give the description of the real nature a Brahmin the infinite the in device above the attribute place cannot be characterized in terms of finite categories as salam o Krishna used to say salam o Krishna Nene's simple words used he said Brahman is the only thing which has never become woodchester that is defiled by human mouth Brahman is the sole reality the Upanishads declared all this is Brahman there is no multiplicity here is talking about the brahmana we are now because a little conception little idea about that Brahman as because Saddam o Krishna is talking about the sachidananda then when we are reaching to that sachidananda by crossing the seven stages that in the yoga it says patanjali yoga darshan and after that we go beyond that throat then comes the eyebrow then ultimately the septum who mean the scepter booming when the fifth one we are crossing then the sixth 170 is absolute that is neat guna Brahma we reach over there tofu knishes an brahma sutras also regard Brahman as the cause of the universe now that difficult only 23 minutes we will say take the cause of the universe according to the Hindu we have already discussed it in our saga of the soul that what is the cause of this universe who created now different religion they express different philosophy they express in different way mostly they seek God created the universe now in the China the conception is the someone created the human being fast and then created the river and not seem to go on fishing another person when the beginning started doing fishing so we have developed a CD one of our devotee very nicely has done it I will show it to you someday is a really good one and this aponi brahma sutra and regard the brahman as the cause of the universe all schools Abaddon to hold that Brahman is both material cause and the intellectual cause the that is the Brahman is a material cause oppa Donna Karan ah oppa Donna is the heir of the world the world which is material in nature consists of countless leaving non-living beings is ever-changing and is catalyzed by dualities such as heat and cold joy and pain it is in every way opposite of the Brahman how can two totally dissimilar and incompatible entities Brahman and the world have any causal relationship at all Brahman is the sole reality how when where can the world exists so that is the solution the Shankar Acharya he has find out para martika Shakti bevo Erica Sathya one is Baraka this expression that we see that is also satya and these same thing Swami Vivekananda in a very simple way said we travel from lower truth to higher truth is not from the false to true from lower truth to higher truth it's a wonderful expression now when you see this world with a mallet various thing we cannot simply say it is all false it is there I am touching and feeling I am smelling so obviously it is there but Babar occurs at their ultimately these things what I think it is a wood or a microphone or a human body in reality it is Brahman so when I say that this is an food there is also truth but lower truth but the higher truth is this is the other form of consciousness which is Brahman now one person suddenly asked the one from sri ramakrishna sir why should one think of God at all I should have to think about God I wanted to explain this today but as because I was thinking the last time I just read the the passages so I thought I must explain so I could not reach here because one hour is a very less time though you people must be thinking when the Xiaomi is going to stop sir so anything so in the one hour the next day again we will discuss on this particular topic brahman maya and why one should have to think about God at all very interesting question thank you very much let us conclude with the preneur mantra to bhagavan sri ramakrishna Nealon janam medium on until firm Bok dong compa Drita Bikram be ye chaahat arum but amisha medium tamarama krishnam sheer asana mama oh shanthi shanthi shanthi hurry home that's earth Sri Ramakrishna our eponymous to you you you
