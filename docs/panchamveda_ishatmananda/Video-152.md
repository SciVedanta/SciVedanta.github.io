[153: Panchama Veda 153- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMx_k_ENi64)

let us begin this the wonderful conversation Ramakrishna is having with the devotees but begin with this mantra tava Kadam rhythm dr. G venom Kobi be rewritten Calma Shahen Ravana Mangalam three Matata Tom Boonen de bourree dodging AHA the conception of on breathe Amrita there is a nectar as if as a drink that we can drink and become immortal but in reality this is the hydrology as a theory is the practice in life people become completely free from the bondage attachment of this physical body that this is the beauty of this book it has been recorded whenever it happened the conversation immediately it was recorded and then it was printed and it was published before those who were present and today we will be reading from the page 383 of the gospel of Salaam o Krishna the master and his injured arm that is the chapter and it was some Saturday February 2nd 1884 3 o clock in the afternoon ceramic Ishta had been conversation with the devotees one day while going toward the Pine Grove ceramic Asia had fallen near the railing and dislocated he born in his lifter and he was in a very exalted mood ecstatic mode at the time and no one had been with him and now see ramakrishna is talking about that Mahima devotee has comes Ramakrishna is telling him well even I am the machine and God is its operator then why should this have happened to me Salam o Krishna is asking that devotee I depend on God I am the machine I don't do anything except that he has to accept the order of God then why it has happened to me how do you answer this this is a very wonderful things ramakrishna the topic that years brought forward you called me as a holy man majority of the people the thing that the holy man means he will not have any type of suffering you'll be completely free like this like this so see Ramakrishna who is the God Himself the incarnation and he is telling this he himself is pointing out and then he is asking this question and this is very very important if I am the machine and the God is the operator I don't do anything even then this thing has happened to me so that is what he wanted to say we can look at this from two different points first is it was a human from the point view of the human we can say that this is parappa karma pala perhaps the pre accumulated works result we know that Hindus the belief karma voila that whatever work you do the result is coming to you they found to come swami vivekananda he say good good bad bad none can skip the law so like that if we see in that from that angle there is a karmic allah assalamu krishna's an Avatara he is the god incarnate he is God himself he's not having any karma father he did nothing as in the bhagavad-gita the fourth chapter Shri Krishna is telling I am taking the human form not because I'm having any work just to help the people to understand what is really religion what is really spirituality so that is if that is the motif in we cannot say this is because of the Karma of Allah why then the second he said when the god is taking the human form he behaved just like human and that is where it is so difficult to understand even the gods 3/3 Ramachandra he was crying for Sita who was abducted by Ravana and he was roaming here and there crying for Sita asking and begging and requesting help from different type of people and Lakshmana excited Lakshmana his brother he told brother we should go over there we should take the help of these we should take the help of that then when he was going on giving suggestions to him the one day serum agenda told Lakshmana do you think I need any help if I want I can kill Ravana with my thumb so that is the third point because the God wins taking the human form he behaved just like human as a human what do you do whenever in problem we always contact our friends our relatives our well wishers and we talked to them can you please suggest me how to overcome these and that God is also doing like that why can you please tell me why you have broken my hand and it is so painful I always dependent God then why even to me it will happen like that and third we can say the devotee should know even we are calling on God depending on God worshiping God meditating on God so this type of thing may happen I remember one incident that happened in under man that one gentleman he lost his son and because of that pain his wife also died so this - terrible thing happened in his life so he was thinking in a very bad mood so suddenly he saw me he was not known to me but then he called me can you please come Swami then I went to his house and he was a Punjabi and he worshipped the Guru Granth cypher all through his life he memorized so many verses of that Guru Granth side and this particular moment he lost faith then he was telling Swami I have worshipped this god of mine for all - my life with great faith even then this thing has happened to me what is the thing that I should worship this why should I shall I throw it then he was asking me I told why you are asking me if you have lost complete faith on God throw it well you need not to take my permission to do when you are asking my permission that means you still have the devotion to God do you remember the past lives you don't so obviously you do not know what you have done in your past life this type of being suffering maybe it was there for you waiting joy was also there you had the company love affection of your wife or such as such a long time you had your son too and now for some time he's an elderly person at some time the God has taken away your wife your son to prove that this is the thing why don't you put your mind and soul 100% now to God okay you gave me I have also played I also enjoyed this human now at the end of my life I put my whole soul and mine thought to you see how things will happen so this way that also the in a negative way it comes to the positive and we see in the life of Shri Krishna also it was the god supreme himself the god but even then he was defeated by jayadratha and he had to leave his own place the mathura and had to go and make a separate place for him and his people far away from mathura in gujarat why god could kill him any moment but when the god is taking the human form the behaved just like human mashallah demony devi he was war she was working and dressing the vegetable and talking with people sometime read about people and talking as the ladies they do and particularly in the village atmosphere circumstances she was doing one lady came and observe and then she told mother we used to come to the Wannsee ramakrishna is to see him constantly remembering God and he's dancing he's taking the name of God talking about God we don't find you in there how come are you bound by Maya then the mother replied what to do I am my I myself oh how am I am I am that then I don't know of course it is not explained with it that lady could understand the implication of the comment of the mother because the Maha Maya she is playing this role so obviously so when cinema Krishna is green on asking this question though just a line but it is very very important if I am the machine and God is its operator then why should this happen to me then afterwards the master was sitting on the couch and listening to the story of Mahima Charen pilgrimage of course he has visited the long long back but many of the places he was going on telling I found a brahmacari in a garden in Banaras he said he had not been he had been living for twenty years but did not know its owner not the rich people in those days days to have their garden they have their different table small small cottages so the holy people can come and stay but this prematurely never cared about where he is leaving he was constantly thinking of God so Mahima was impressed he was telling that and also on my answering in the negative he said then you were a wandering holy man he was asking do you have any job he was not very much aware about the worldly the system only life he knew that man should earn his livelihood by working but my now was a very rich man himself why should you work under someone so when he asked do you do any job doesn't know oh then that means you were a holy man these are the two things he could understand so he said like that but simple person and another person about him he was telling that is a I saw a shot on the bank of the Narmada in the southern side and he repeated the gayatri mentally it's so drilled him that the hair on his body stood on end the wing is to take the name of that Gayatri mantra usually the Brahm means they take that Gayatri mantra it is the prayer to the Sun God the God of knowledge God of light and when his to repeat that mantra he is the hair on his bodies to stand in and we knee repeated the Gayatri and home aloud he drilled those who sat near him so he was impressed he was telling the stories Salam Krishna was hearing and slowly slowly a different mood came to the master then he was asking to them him the master Masha his disciple the person who has recorded this he was his disciple master Marcia he told what have you brought for me I am hungry this is the special the characteristics that he find in Bhagavan see Ramakrishna whenever he was who was about to lose his consciousness used to march in the infinite is to go into Samadhi to pull his mark mind down he is to think about someone I must go and meet or I should eat these I should do that to bring down his mind to that particular desire and he was telling what have you brought for me and he saw that I Colin he was very happy I shall eat some jalabiya he was telling ya see Ramakrishna I shall drink some water look at it so when he was telling like that desire now we know why were bound each and every one of us the human being are in reality divine but still we do not understand this divinity if you observe the movies if we read the books and the reports in the published in the newspapers or TV all the time people are doing so many varieties of things news from north to south and east and west from every corner of the world information is coming about the human being particularly what music there all the time some people are having demand on these or they're fighting with others these and that is going on manifestation of the desire at the back of the desire ego and ego is I I want these we want these so this is the going on so naturally for us for every human being everything is natural because this is normal we see each and every one is doing I am also doing but we do not understand in reality we are divine how we can understand that when there will be no desire completely free from the desire so he was thinking with that way ceramic Reznor was crying o Brahma may Brahma he means mother Kali Oh mother why has Dow done this to me my arm is badly hard he is crying to the mother because he was having the pain this is also a teaching when we have some problem we always go to some people for solace for help we never go to God why you have done this to me nobody did someone insulted me instead of going and complaining to others if we go to the source go to the mother and see what is to me that person insulted no you have done this he has no right no power to do this to me I know that through that person you are making this to me I'm suffering Oh mother I am your son I am your daughter I am your child please don't do this to me see Ramakrishna through this is giving the teaching how to pray what to pray whom to break everything to the mother that God Himself is praying to mother who I have broken my heart and it is hurting just like a child goes to the mother and says this is the this thing happened to me and it is hurting start crying the mother gives the solace he is also doing like that and he is asking the others shall I be alright they are also comforting him surely you will be quite weld again then the master again went into spiritual mode and he said two pictures side by side we see always in the life of Serrano Krishna he is asking he spring to the mother what is that happened to me it is hurting I am your son I am your child at the same time who it is coming to the this human mood is asking other humans what do you think all right so these are the two moves constantly going on it so difficult to really understand ceramic dish now see Ramakrishna once again his spiritual mood wait hi and he said Oh mother what is this that I am saying on et Brahma we know from the Venetian own et Brahma and the Brahman is that we can say the expression of the all-powerful all-pervading consciousness in the bather they say it is Brahman and as because the ordinary people won't be able to understand so the conception of God comes in the philosophy we are reading that we are discussing about that and here ceramic ISNA he chanted the mantra Oh and immediately he never wanted to go into that particular mode he is again bringing down his mind and praying to the mother what is this I am saying don't make me unconscious mother with the knowledge of Brahman look at all the life life of the life the aspirants the spiritual seekers they are meditating they're practicing so much of austerity only to reach over here to realize Brahman to understand brahman and when that is so easy for ceramic krishna is refusing can you understand this his spiritual height some of the people they say oh see Ramakrishna is a human being and he was practicing sadhana a little bit of realization it happens to so many others also easy like that can anyone refuse the knowledge of Brahmin he is refusing as if it is given to him just like that and he is refusing and he is telling don't make me unconscious the moment the mind goes to the Brahman that super conscious stage the naturally you forget the existence of the world mother with the knowledge don't give me Brahma guiana sir can imagine the status of saddam additional I am but died child this is the speciality I am but died child and easily Oh deed and frightened he is expressing indirectly when he was crying when he was praying why my hand is broken asking other people do you think it will be alright now he is telling I like to behave like a child child of God a special path that's Ramakrishna asking us to follow you we know that in the Baptist in the bhakti the path there are five approaches to God because different five moves are there so we can behave the and the servant God is the master and God is the Sun I am the parent or I am the father and mother and God is my lover at the beloved like this different type of mood is there cinema Christian is introducing this I am your child we were reading in the last Sunday the beloved chharia one our one of the charges he also belongs to the Vedanta and of course he is propagating the which never and he said that God should be worshipped as Bala Gopala his conception is Bala Gopala God is Krishna the supreme Rama is Krishna and what type of Krishna baby Krishna is a baller Gopala baby Krishna and then you feel affection and that is the purest you cannot ask anything from a baby a child the moment we think about the God we go with a big list Oh God you are the supreme you were powerful please give me these give me that but when you talk to you baby when you talk to you with child this purest of the pure can be relation between the devotee and the God the devotee is taking care of the God that is the purest of the pure form them he introduced these vallabhacharya and cinema Krishna is just changing that's in position you know I am the child you are my parents you are my father you are my mother Oh God I do not know what should I do it is your responsibility you have to take care of me when a devotee becomes the child he has no responsibility nothing to perform only two things faith in the existence of the God as mother or father the Jesus the Western Theory Father God as father in this turn they say mother whatever but if the God is my father God is my mother I am his child I don't have any responsibilities responsibilities we will find that say Ramakrishna is telling I am easily worried and frightened I want the mother a million salutation to the knowledge of brahmana give it to those who seek it Oh Anand me Oh bliss full mother I want you so this way he is having that prayer and he is telling that you should take care of me again he said to the divine mother he's talking with the divine mother what wrong have I done mother do I ever do anything it is dull mother who doest everything I am the machine and how art its operator is a hinge that he is giving again and again how to live can one live in that situation that mental situation I do nothing I wait for the God's command only he can do or she can do that devotee can do who is not having an iota of ego even five years old boy if the mother is telling don't go over there even then he will go why ego I will go even the mother is telling I will go but a small baby on the lap of the mother only depending on the mother wherever the mother will take it will go on the baby orders to the baby we win we become the little child baby of the Divine Mother I don't do anything mother and baby is not having any go that is the unique way completely dedication of the ego of course the Dasha Baba the Maha reader he was having tremendous power to lead the Bala dharmam but even then he was constantly having that idea Sadam gender is the master and I am the servant ego you have to remove completely good then only you can do but the baby form I don't do anything if you ask me to do I will do and the way you ask me to do I will do everything depends on you I am the machine driven dinar is also praying to God make me your instrument and play America wrote Tamar Pina Pina is a musical instrument the make me the instrument in your hands Ramakrishna is telling what wrong have I done mother I do I do anything everything is done by you I am the machine and how are the operator again addressing he's telling do I weep because I'm a heart he is explaining now do I will because I am heart no I am angry because you have not protected me mother is supposed to be with me all the time so he is telling in a Bengali in the shamash angry it is there too two lines are me weekly kid Krrish a monkey the means I repent I cry because of these what is that you are my mother you were with me even then everything has been stolen how it is possible you are the mother of the universe you know everything you were supremely powerful even then what is happening to me does it mean that you are not protecting me and afraid of that I don't bother about the pain physical pain that is happening so this is a way of complaining to mother you should be present all the time every time with me so this is telling mother this is the grief that solely grieves my heart that even with D for mother and do I am wide awake I'm aware about your presence there should be robbery in my house so this is the translation of that song as a beautiful song and that Shama Shama Shama means the goddess Kali and to praise too this is the way Salaam o Krishna quoting two lines of that and stealing not that it is because of the pain I'm crying I'm crying afraid that have you left me when the Jesus was carrying his own cross and people were painting on him the stones it was terrible a heart and jokingly oh he was the king they put that the thorns on his head it was bleeding terrible pain so that time he said o my father why all these things to me you are whatever you were asking me to do I am doing them even then why should I have to suffer so much so that is the way the salam o krishna still i don't i'm not crying for the physical pain and he said doing.we because i am a heart no mother this is the grief there solely grieves my heart even though you Deever mother and though i am wide awake there should be rubber in my house then the master to the devotee it will avail you nothing unless you realize sat-chit-ananda all this after all this suddenly he comes to point the devotees who assembled over there he is telling them it will avail you nothing unless you realize succeed on under there is nothing like discrimination and renunciation now this is where those who were the singers didn't know they Google on different tune and suddenly will come come on the bass it's called soma they will come back to the soma on the bass again they will go Salameh krishna is narrating so many way and making people interested to listen to him and suddenly come to the that particular base and then he says you have to realize God in the open Isha divine is asserting very strongly you must realize your own soul in this life Hachette abated at a Septimus t if you have realized your true nature then you're blessed you Hatchett abated at a septum esteem not cheap yabai deep maja t- t if you cannot realize God in this very life as a great great loss so this is what C Ramakrishna is telling since you have got the human life don't waste it we spend so much of time but we do not think about God we do not pray to God we don't read about God we do not eat prasada when whatever we eat if we eat that it has been touched by the God and I am eating only to keep this body so that I can serve God so that they can remember God I can pray to God only for that so that we complete devotion such cheat on under he was telling I don't need Brahma gana now he is telling you have to realize your own self and that is such cheat on endure that means Brahman there is nothing like discrimination and renunciation bechara and by the object these are the two words again and again comes in our sastra what are the paths what one should do only to be Chara what is the pitcher everything is moving everything is temporary why should I keep my mind on that because it will pass away rather I will go and give my mind and keep my mind on there which is permanent so bechara which are of nithya anita again and again these two terms these two words it comes in the indian philosophy you have to understand these which is permanent and which is temporary so discrimination is this capacity majority of the people we do not understand that most of the people when you go and see the broken the palaces oh this is the broken Palace of that King it was constructed on the so and so that time and the name of the king was there and that dynasty was these we go on thinking we don't remember that look at it hundred years the ruled and they developed such a huge construction and now they're nowhere I sometimes tell when we go to Delhi is called Red Fort Lal Qila this Lal Qila arkla that the fort that is the main thing in the Indian history the Marathas the game to capture that hundreds of them they laid their life they could not capture then from Rajasthan they also came they also could Noren capture so many people tried to capture that because anyone capturing that controlling that become the supreme ruler of India and now if you go purchase a ticket enter Agora nobody is there to stop him anywhere in that you can go you can see where the Queen seems to be where the King used to sleep whether those people is to dine all things are there anyone can go anywhere inside what does it mean all that a temporary very very temporary does relate their life for that and they were thinking this is my ultimate goal to capture this particular fort where are they so this is called discrimination name fame power nothing remains we must remember and that is called discrimination and the moment we can understand that properly its come renunciation about that I don't want that even if I am sitting under a tree if I don't have a room it doesn't matter that Jesus also telling in a very practical way he is telling even the bards have the nest and the jackals of the holes but the Son of God has no place to lie on I don't have any place I can say this is that belongs to me so that is the way the discrimination and renunciation and this is the extreme way of renunciation but the renunciation means giving up the ego this belongs to me and me alone and none else so that should be given up one must be restless for God's lama krishna's telling if a son goes on asking for the share of the property his parents concerned with each other and give it to him even though he's a minor sadhana Krishna observed it and if the son is going on praying to the father and pestering give me my portion so father it's okay now go away similarly if we go again and again and again and again to God and say I must get you a property that is the purity that is the love that is the unselfishness that is the realization these are the properties of God give me right now I want it right now because you are my father you're my mother I have every right to claim he will give it to you can you imagine so this is the way that means the prayer doesn't mean that you have to constantly fold your hand and do like that and the long Sanskrit chanting this is just conversation conversation between a son and the father son and the mother and the son who is believing that this is my father sitting over here he is alive not that he's in the picture only or in image or in the sky he is here he is listening to me and that is why God Jesus said knock the door and it will be open unto you the knocking the door means you have to go on praying and prayer is possible when you have complete field of the exist of God so he says like this since he has begotten us surely he we can claim our inheritance from him he has given us the birth so I have every right to claim this is the wonderful way the relationship between a man and God he's my father so why should I have to take the help of somebody else the third party the Perot heater he's he has to pray for me he has to worship for me that is the secondary thing why that man will come and he will utter some mantra and you throw this is the food I like to offer to my god I cook I offer any pray now please eat after your eating then only I can eat come and see it and eat then let me have my food then you go to rest I'll also go the wonderful relation and that is exactly what Ramakrishna is asking us to do this is the beautiful relation and we can say to him reveal thyself to me or I shall cut my throat with the knife it's so eager you must reveal to me then see Ramakrishna is telling how he is to pray I used to pray to her in this way the prayer Oh mother Oh blissful one revealed I said to me and thou must thou must look at it the way he is demanding to God and he is telling again I would say to her Oh Lord of the lowly Allah lord of the universe surely I am NOT outside the union I am bereft of knowledge and without discipline I do not have devotion I know nothing thou must be gracious and revealed eyes that to me imagine the wonderful way God is teaching to pray now we are going on comparative religion and then the Vedanta running here and there for the pilgrimage reading so much a book for what Saddam kishna Swasey straight not that only Hindus can have this anyone any fact yatama prapadyante tams tathaiva by JAMA in the bhagavad-gita the God is promising any way anywhere anyone in any manner he is worshiping me all is coming to me why he knows everyone's heart he is reciting within the heart of each and every one it doesn't matter if I am speaking in Roman he knows it not that I have to speak only in Sanskrit neither so that is the way just talk and this is the way whenever we are working when we are working and talking with God so I have been given this work I am doing help me so that I can do it perfectly that's all that is the prayer that is your puja not that you have to go and bathe and see it in the on the seat of a priest and all the time doing chanting the mantra and the priest is doing that is his business but I am a laborer I am working on the street but whatever I am doing I am going on talking with God this is the job that you have given to me I have learned whatever I know I am offering to you you see that whatever I am doing must be perfect with whom I am talking with God and we name him going on talking with God what happens my mind is with God and when my mind is at God what happens I'm in the constant company of the Holy One some people there to sing Mirabai she's to sing and in the extracts is to dance salsa and Mira have I became a saint but Ponson was also singing he was also very powerful singer but most of his song was to please the king and the other people not for God that these two differences the same song offered to the God that gives a different height Danson is respected Danson is known and Danson is really watch it by the singers but not from not the same register same platform of meerabai madaba is assad iike people keep the photos of the rabbi in the shrine and worship there's a different height same song so this is the way cinema krishna is teaching us thus the master taught the devotees how to pray they were deeply touched tears filled Mahima pterence eyes my veteran was crying listen to that and see Rama Krishna then in a static mood he was singing cry to your mother Shama with a real cry dr. Kamal dark our motto c'mon sham attractive cry to your mother Shama with a real cry Oh mine he is addressing his own mind and how can she hold herself from you how can shaman stay away when a baby when a child is crying wherever maybe the mother mother may be the head of the state but she will come running to the baby leaving aside all the responsibilities and the duties the same way if we can cry to the God and he will come several devotees are right from sheep a place little away from the Dutch nation and naturally ceramic is not seeing that the devotees are coming the he could not say that I don't like to talk now I am tired once again is sad for them talking this is the special thing we should know those who are artists with the organization we have built this temple we have built the shrine the asana the center when the people are coming we should be always very very courteous tools the devotees we were here and the Swami's who are there must be very courteous why they're coming to God not to you and this is not your house you cannot refuse you cannot say no I am tired go away the door is closed no that cannot be it should be there coming to God of course the time is there the midnight if anybody is coming we can say sorry come in the morning but in the whole day time that you have announced we must keep this wide cinema Krishna is waiting for them he has given the call no one can come to God unless he is calling them call may be strong call may be little low but still the call reaching the heart so the people are coming those who are coming hearing the call of God their bliss seeing them talking to them serving them helping them I am getting my merits God is happy that they are taking care of my devotees when someone is coming his disciples wills to steal but their dish to give them water dish to bring them over there this to offer sometimes the sweets and fruits whatever they were there so that way we create joy when we are doing not that mine Public Relation is developing oh this is my name is this this is my email id come let us exchange and I am developing the big list of my friends know you are coming to God I am a humble servant of this place sometimes some people here they always ask if any devotee is picking up the phone they will ask what is your name and we create the joy they will tell this is my dam that is the name I don't know you should not say you say I am a volunteer of this place I'm a volunteer serving this organization whatever so that way slowly we can remove the ego and if I can do some work immediately ego start coming if somebody else is coming to do that work immediately I'm feeling Restless why you should come this is wrong thing the practices should be this and several devotees that come and see Ramakrishna is telling them some of the essentials of the spiritual life essentials of the spiritual life what of that God alone is real and all else usually the garden and its owner God and his splendor both peep but people look at the garden only how few seek out the owner when you look at the world we'd go to flower flower places spending thousands of dollars and after coming back we give all the photos now in the Facebook and sharing that I went over there I made these I saw these a beautiful displays that place and if you ask them can you please donate $100 to a good work I don't have that much money okay I listen to you I'll keep in mind I'll see I am telling this because because we do not know all these things that is me God has made it is okay but when the God needs your service that time we always are very very calculated remember that a wonderful story of Mahabharata Arjuna and Duryodhana they went to invite sri krishna most of the Indians almost everyone they remembered that story and answer of the garza krishna he said here thousands of my soldier will highly trained soldiers and this side i alone and that do and not take part in the world I'm not going to do anything I will never pick up any weapon choose now homie say to Arjuna the terrible examination we can image and understand and he was examining his devotee you love me the god or you love the world or do not choose God Diddley a little boy he went to the human the king of death and then he was Numa was telling I will give you all these wonderful things that not a human being and they were seen everything the I will give to you EEMA rama surah taha Toria now in lumbini Imanishi the human being cannot have this I will give all these beautiful sillas chills things to you and the young boy he said what I am going to do with all this maybe they will simply be there for thousand years but it is a limitation is there I want knowledge I want you when the other young gentleman he went to meet see the Kali not in there not how old he was very very young and when he went and saw the goddess Kali standing over there he was not bewildered and his mother was hungry brothers were hungry sisters were hungry he would needed a job we needed money but discrimination they saw wrong I want you mother not your this is called true devotee this understanding of this truth so this is called the devotee then another gentleman is asking self what is the way let me know how to realize God see Ramakrishna said discrimination between the real and the unreal one should always discriminate to the effect that God alone is real and the world unreal is not false is not there not like that unreal it is there but temporary and one should pray with sincere longing that the gentleman is telling just like ours but said where is our leisure for these things we have other other things to do we have time to do but only about God we don't have time so that is ceramic isten immediately is telling he is not angry but he's telling those who have the time must meditate and worship but those who cannot possibly do so must bow down wholeheartedly to God twice a day look at it if you don't have time sometimes some people really they are so pressurized they had to work so hard to earn just little livelihood so what did we do wholeheartedly lovingly if they are bowing down to God and praying that would be sufficient he abides in the hearts of all the God is deciding in the hearts of all he knows that the worldly people have many things to do what else is possible for them all is vain unless you ate in God and see him ultimately he is telling but remember all his vain unless you realize God and see him and the devotee he told the eunuch world that was the main topic of today he said sad to see you is the same as to see God to see you as a saint to see God the Jesus said he who has seen the sanest in the father same way twin will look at Saddam hawkish now what we see completely ego free personality and tremendous knowledge about each and everything about the past the present and the future of every human being everything so these two qualities is impossible if is not having that knowledge of God or the Son of God so that is why this man the moment is a personal question don't say like that easily we'll come to that in our next class he is telling because you don't like that people without knowing just know carved you just loved me you be with me you follow not like that understand and develop that is the spirituality and majority of the people will only follow me and that is slowly becoming current religion is as from American disease religion is a process that Nick makes a route unto man man unto God so this is gradual development of our mind and thinking process and that is religion thank you very much next day we will discuss about this big portion again this is conclude by offering over pranaam to the one Sadam occasional hunter who popped on compa Drita Bikram boy he shall with Oram para misha medium tom ramakrishna Shira son [Music] Oh Chandi Chandi Chandi hurry you that said Sri Ramakrishna our eponymous too [Music]
