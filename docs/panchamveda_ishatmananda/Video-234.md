[235: Panchama Veda 235 : God Realization is the Goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWC1g3cNE4)

the nectar of thy effacing utterances bring life and hope to those scorched by misery they are extraordinary sages and men listening to them should bestow auspiciousness on all they confer very prosperity those who spend spread them broadcast are verily magnanimous they distribute what is completely satisfying to the hearers so that is the total meaning complete meaning and very simple way we can say listening the holy words and which has come from the god himself that is the great tapasha that is sufficient so that is the way we have to understand the hearing or reading or expounding these holy words and it's they are using it as gopigeeta katha amrita now today we will study from the advice to ishaan it was saturday october 11 1884 and the english the gospel of krishna page 605 so they there we find the bhagavan sriram krishna continuing and as because the last time we heard that he is mentioning about the karmapala the humanity in great details we have discussed in our last lecture last talk and he is mentioning in his last birth a man is endowed with sattva the prakrti the nature the power of god the maya in different names they say it is having three qualities the power of god are three qualities raja makes tama the lowest the last birth if someone is having the sattva that means the good all good qualities his mind is directed to god so when the people they think that we should think about god try to realize god try to know god among these people there are four categories in the bhagavad-gita we know that arto jigyasu and gyani arthur those who are suffering curious arthur they want the name fame prosperity and the fourth one is gyani so those who are trying to understand god realize god manusyanam he a very very few very few people among millions only and the little peop group only they will be interested millions and million people they believe in god but they're afraid of god they like the protection of the god at that much and then after the death they will go to hell and that all those conceptions that developed to control the morality to make people human being so that is the different thing but those who are genuinely asking seeking god to realize god how it is coming sudan krishna said it is from the last birth then he is mentioning two people here first he says krsna-prasad pal came here i found him full of rajas the sirama krishna the great master and he could understand by seeing a person and by and observing his behavior whether he is a tamashik or rajashik or satthik those people who are trying to understand that they can also understand but sudama krishna was excellent immediately just by seeing he could understand what is going on inside the mind of that particular person so he is mentioning one gentleman who was visiting him krishna prasad pal krishna krishna he was a rajashik person another name is a young boy and he was very fond of that why he was full of shaatiq one is rajashi another is shaatik then narayan arrived sudama krishna was very happy to see him look at surama krishna the god himself he is happy seeing a young boy can you imagine the how lucky that boy why because he has already completed all the good deeds and that's why he came so close to god and god started loving him liking him naren that boy arrived sirama krishna was very happy to see him he seated narayan by his side on the small couch he showed him his love by stroking his body and giving him sweets to eat sometimes when the children they come just to use a pat on their back to show the affection sudama krishna is doing that then he asks narayan tenderly will you have some water narang was a student at aim school master master school master moshe was the head master is the offer and the school was founded by biddah sagar school is still there in calcutta at home his people beat him for visiting siram krishna so this is because the parents are very afraid that their children their son and the daughter may become a monk or a nun and that is very peculiar they will go and touch the feet of a holy man and they will donate but they don't like their children their son and daughter become that holy person no why tremendous attachment it is my son my daughter they should not go anywhere they should be always with us so that is the attachment at the same time the religious people they visit temple they will teach their children to bow down and to offer donation all those things they will do but when you ask when you have so much respect for the holy people and you are having so much faith in god but you allow them to become a holy person to a monk or a nun no that is maya so there here he is mentioning the parents of that narayan they were very angry when they came to know that he is visiting siram krishna sriram krishna was a holy man if you are going and having not only naren almost all the young people who used to come to sram krishna their parents were not at all happy but in those days in the highest society in calcutta a young boy the age of 15 16 if he is drinking or smoking that was a lot parents will be all right with that no he is growing up that is the normal behavior but when he is going to a holy place that is very peculiar it reminds me that one lady came to me and she was so angry i never saw her that was the first time i was in andaman and she came from all the way from calcutta flying for two hours to andaman and then he she came to me and told why you allow my husband to come to you at first i couldn't understand who is your husband i don't know there aren't many people they come then one gentleman he was a bank officer he used to come and visit he was a good person just after the office he used to come in and there was nothing no other places to go only some people used to go to the pubs to drink and all that so he used to come to the center attending sometimes the prayer talking with me just different type of subjects we used to discuss sometimes is to take the prasad and food and then is to go back somehow she came to know that the man is visiting the temple and spending time with the monks and immediately she thought oh this gentleman is going to become a monk i am going to lose my husband she came and she and she used very strong words against me he told you should not do this ultimately afterwards told okay that is all right i cannot ask him not to come that is you can tell you say you stop him that's okay but tell me he's not going to the pub which most of his friends are doing he is coming to a holy place spending time very nicely and he is becoming more and more good person you don't like it you like that he should be a bad person a drunkard what choice so this is very peculiar you cannot explain only explanation as bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling in the past birth if you are not having good karma you won't understand the dharma and that is called maya god is binding us in that way sudama krishna through showing his love to the young boy he is proving the god like those who have purified their mind this boy he came you had better get a leather jacket surrounding his joking as his father used to beat him in india that is normal in other countries also and to make the sun that the father sometimes become angry they will beat the tsunami krishna is joking you better get a leather jacket then the beating won't hurt you so that is the way he is making and turning to harish the master said that he would like to have a smoke again addressing narayan sirama krishna said that that is he said about another friend ah nilkantha came here the other day what spiritual farmer he has he said he would come here another day and sing for us they are dancing over there why don't you go and see it so this is mentioning about a singer now we find a gentleman he came he was visiting krishna his name was krishna dash pal krishna noticed that he's a good person he came to visit but he's a raja shika that means he wants to do something good but with the ego i am visiting you i am donating this to you i am doing this i am doing that he had an inclination to come to a holy person but at the same time that ego is keeping him separate from that holy person is not no no other than god himself so we have left our heart and home and practicing meditation for last 43 44 years only to see this bhagavan sirama krishna before us and now that gentleman who was so lucky he in person he went and met him but he didn't like so that is the difference so they were so lucky to see god but could not realize but the young boy he liked it he went he met siram krishna he talked with him all these things it brings sirama krishna is telling sattvaguna how it can be acquired by good works sometimes the last birth sometimes in this life it is possible and he's talking about a singer but the singer is having the devotion he sings only but as because the singer is singing with the devotion the god is liking it friends when we are reading the gospel of sirama krishna if we think that what the god like he likes only that our complete mind and the pure mind our desire to realize god to satisfy god and to bring the attention of the god through songs through other things whatever and we find that a young boy is coming he loves the ramakrishna he likes ramakrishna god is attracted and he is protecting him a singer is coming to him god is liking and he is also giving them the blessings and now here we find in the human body when the god is residing and he works very perfectly a very small little thing master mashay noticed and recorded here what is that he told ram lal ram lal was a nephew he used to attend to sir ramakrishna serves he told him there is no oil in the room because they used to burn the lamps so the kerosene oil was necessary and sometimes otherwise to burn that krishna noticed it for every little thing how conscious sometimes spiritual man means he forgets everything he's careless wherever he is sitting he leave something over there no that means that man never practices meditation when you are practicing meditation your mind is alert for everything you never forget you will you should not make any mistake the sirama krishna's life is teaching us how the spiritual life should be spiritual life doesn't mean the careless life is a very very disciplined life he told ramallah you better go and fetch it there is no oil in the room looking at the oil jar the servant hasn't filled it the sidhama krishna he was a pujari and it was the duty of some people just to come and fill that jar with the oil and they used to burn the lambs like that with a little thing with a small thing and sometimes the consecrated fruits and the things that was offered to the divine mother a little portion was supposed to come to siram krishna that was the system in the temple i am mentioning another incident the one he noticed that he was not gay that way that food should come i should eat not like that but he used to give it to the devotees the food the fruits that was offered the sweets that were offered to the mother so obviously then he noticed that it is not coming first day he didn't say anything okay then he noticed that it is not coming the next day too immediately he sent his attendant go and take bring it from the office and tell them i am supposed to get one packet why i am not getting it so these why i'm mentioning because these are the perfections not that he is eager to get it and all that nothing one should not make any mistake in that he is mentioning it because it should come properly what is supposed to come must come so this we learned then when we were in training center we used to send the plates to our president vice president swamiji's and general citri they were old elderly people and they were so busy with people used to visit them so they could not come personally in the in our the kitchen it's a big kitchen below if you go so 200 300 people sitting together and eating sometimes there's to come some time the president president is not possible we the brahmacharyans in the training center some of them were given that duty to arrange food and a different type of uh the preparations that was offered to bhagavan's ramakrishna masharada should be given on that plate one should not make any mistake and that is the one must be very very careful when preparing why otherwise the president marriage will notice you won't eat is not possible mostly our president vice president they are very elderly people they will eat very little but they will see why they have not given so this is called discipline in a spiritual life everything should be disciplined or pramatya bhabha as they say prabhatta means indiscipline sometimes he's doing this sometimes he's doing that no not like that everything in a right time in the right moment in the right fashion right way you should go on doing that is spiritual life suramar krishna said like that after a little while he returned to his room he was walking here and there returned to his room and sat on the small couch it was past three in the afternoon the devotees took their seats on the floor the master sat in silence before them now and then casting a glance at the walls sirama krishna was sitting on his that couch small couch and the devotees were sitting master was shy drawing that picture and sudama krishna's looking on the wall where many pictures were hanging to suramar krsna's left was a picture of sharashvati the god is of learning and beyond it a picture of god and nitai singing kirtan with their devotees caitanya mahaprabhu he was also named as gore because of the bright complexion so gore and nitai they are singing in front of the master hang picture of durga prahlada mother kali on the wall to his right was another picture of divine mother and behind him was a picture of jesus christ rising the drowning peter the jesus that was a painting all this are still there in that room when the master mushai how nicely he is recorded he has noticed and recorded in which direction what now those who are maintaining that particular room where siram krishna lived when they are decorating if they read this particular portion they will know the which picture should go to on which wall that is master master how nicely he kept now when we read we go then we turn otaku was looking at this picture so ramakrishna was looking at this picture he was looking at that picture why so many pictures suddenly salaam krishna turned to m m means master master and said you see it is good to keep pictures of sannyasins and holy men in one's room we have suramar krishna great master of spirituality everything every occasion he always guide the devotees to develop the spirituality that is his only goal and nothing else his mission is to encourage people guide them and look at it keeping the holy picture that is also one of the spiritual discipline one should practice and while he is so many devotees are sitting before him but he is addressing a master master because master masha is eager to develop his spirituality so sudama krishna is telling this word directly to him and said you see it is good to keep pictures of sannyasins and holy men in one's room when you get up in the morning you should see the faces of holy persons rather than the faces of other people you know we have it for a long time we are in this monastic life and we are our habit is to look at different suramar krishna and only people the pictures so when you go to somebody's house we try to find this that under gods and goddess picture but sometimes we don't find anywhere so it's very difficult so we can understand now when sudama krishna said so you should constantly be connected with the god the moment you are getting up from the sleep you see the face of god goddess a holy person immediately you are reminded of that holiness that god the spirituality the higher life just by seeing the picture that is the way one should practice spirituality spirituality doesn't mean that all the time we have to go and sit and meditate and not talking nothing like that that is okay but at the same time every moment of our life should be dedicated in that particular thought that's the god thought our suramar krsna's the very favorite disciple rakhal maharaj used to say and he became very famous as maharaj in the suramar krishna family and he was the first president we can say the raja maharaj he said if you use one seat use one mantra and keep one object for your meditation your that very seat on on which you are sitting and practicing meditation will be sanctified will be purified the moment you sit on that particular seed that seed will remind you help you for concentration and meditation ashon sudhi what is that asana this when you are sitting on a particular in a particular place on a particular arsana and this may be a mattress or something and regularly practicing the same mantra and also meditating on the same object of the god and goddess you that seed become sanctified purified asha nashuddi the same way sirama krishna is telling in each and everything it should be only one direction spirituality related to god so one should keep people with rajashi qualities keep english pictures in their walls suramar krishna observe it because used to go to different rich people's houses he observed he mentioned the pictures of richmond the king the queen the prince of wells the prince of wales that also he knew because he visited that time so he knew that the white men and women walking together that shows their rajashik temperament i have seen in the rich family of course that is also good the people are spending encouraging the painters uh for different type of pictures and they will purchase it with spending the hundred and so lacks of rupees they'll be purchasing in india i've seen maybe five blacks 10 lakhs 50 lakhs unthinkable and there may be only a horse a half or something like that there they are keeping that over there and with the great so different type of pictures raja sheet qualities but in other way it is good they're inspiring the painters and the artists that's also all right but those who are trying to develop the spirituality for them only holy people the picture of the holy people ganga the himalaya sky sunrise that gives that impetus you acquire the nature of the people whose company you keep bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling so one should be careful in his travel in his way to god he should be careful with whom he is mixing and obviously if you are all the time mixing with some type of people who are their mind is always in the body can't think of anything else constantly talking about the dress and the jewelries and the rich car and the position in the society if you're constantly in that company your mind will also go into that very difficult to come out and put the mind to god that is why sirama krishna said first have the holy company second go to a quiet place where no one around you are only watching your own mind so this is the way one should be therefore even pictures may prove harmful again a man seeks the company that agrees with his own nature sirama krishna said that the past birth we have developed our nature what is that nature our desires again and again the thought that has crossed in our mind and that has given us a characteristic what is the character a repeated habit character is nothing but the repeated habit and what is the habit where comes from thought the same thing them thinking so that way it becomes like that so one should be very careful when he wants to develop the spiritual life a paramahamsa they like the children why because the small little children they're playing and they are holding a doll but the next moment they'll throw the doll and go away no attachment to anything paramahamsa means the air in this world mixing with the people living in this worldly life but there is no attachment to anything paramahamsas are not under the control of the goonas satya raja and tama so good people swathik people they always tell the truth they always pray for others they're helping others thinking for others good people shot thick people but they are not parama answers the paramahamsa go beyond that even where there is no attachment the sudama mentioning paramahamsa is this stage where they have gone beyond the three gunas that means beyond the three guna what is there nothing but the god nothing but that ultimate reality which has been termed as a call in different names that ultimate reality that paramahamsa's by looking at tree a man arrogance in his heart the picture of a hermitage in which a rishi is practicing austerity the likings sometimes some people they like these sometimes like that but the spiritually minded person they always like holy people holy activities holy atmosphere that is what bhagavan's rama krishna is mentioning he saw a tree only immediately imagine the under that beautiful tree there is a small cottage and inside the cottage a rishi is meditating he is withdrawing his mind and putting that into the consciousness that is the ultimate the consciousness and unconscious world both are created by god and if we go back to consciousness we go to god we go to eternity we go to bliss we go to happiness we go to fearlessness and completely free from all desires but if we go to opposite and that is apparently beautiful and if you go to that the world suffering again and again this life the next life the next life we do not know how we will take birth and how we will suffer or enjoy it goes on a brahmin from sinthi entered the room and saluted sram krishna master mahashaya notice giving this information a brahmin gentleman he came from siti siti is the opposite to dakshinesha they crossed the ganga and came to the belu our dakshinesha entered into salaam krishna's room he had started vedanta in banaras he was stout and had a smiling face master hello how are you you haven't been here in a long time the surama krishna needs to keep contact with so many people so many people used to visit him and used to talk to them different type of people this is a brahman who is we studying the vedanta and to study vedanta he went benares benares is a seat of learning and all people they go to veneras for learning sanskrit and the vedanta and different scriptures binaries is considered as a very holy city and slowly slowly the our indian people are understanding it and maybe one day they will keep the city completely free from all other things but only the spiritual knowledge the philosophy that should be practiced over there but anyway a lot of population you cannot control like that to some but still this is there the pundits smiling worldly duty is there you know i have very little leisure the sudama krishna told i have not seen you for a long time he said worldly duty is there i have many other duties the pundits sat down and the master began to talk with him master you spent a long time in banaras tell us what you saw there tell us something about doyananda sirama krishna used to go into the samadhi now and then very often but even then he used to keep information all around that time dayananda saraswati she was bringing it trying to bring a reform in the hindu society he was very famous so suramar krishna knew it that he said you spent a long time in benares at that time then on the sharashiti went to benares he was in benares and he was trying to convince the pandits in banaras about his own view your own philosophy he's a hindu we will see from here how this uh suramar krishna mentioned about the dayananda pundit yes i met him you also met him didn't you krishna made him master yes i visited him he was leaving then in a garden house on the other side of the ganges that means in calcutta side kesha was expected there that day he longed for kesha as the chathaka bard longs for rain that means he was very eager to become acquainted with the keshav chandrashain keshav was very famous in those days so dhyananda wanted that his philosophy his ideology his views if he can somehow convey to keshav chandrashin and then through keshav it will be a reaching to a greater society so that was his idea krishna noticed it and he say mentioned like that he was a great scholar and made fun of bengali language he admitted the existence of the date he admitted the existence of the deities but keshav did not dhyananda used to say god has created so many things couldn't he have created the deities duananda believed the ultimate reality to be without form captain was repeating the name of rama then and said to him sarcastically better repeat shandey shandesh sandhis is a sweet thing of the the bengal is the eat when the captain was repeating rama that then and understood that when all people are sitting around why unnecessarily you have to repeat in that way it's a show up he didn't like so he said instead of rama you better say shandesh if the shandesh comes that is at least he will test it so like that he was joking and making fun with the bengali language he was a spirited person you know this dhyananda the he established arya samaj and it is on bombay 10th april 1875 10th april 1875 this is the year when other societies were also formed like the theosophical society we will talk to we'll talk about that too his pre-monastic name was moon shankar and he was born in gujarat in india 1824 and died in ajime 1883. sirama krishna was born in 1836 and that means he was senior then srama krishna and he was born in 1824 this he was going on spreading the hindu dharma and what happened he established the school at that time he was a missionary established the school and he used to give everything to the students in those days and emphasize the vedic values culture virtue and sanatana dharma eternal religion and he also performed the in not allowed the murthy puja even today this the they do don't do that's called arya samaj still so many centers are there all over india and also outside india and africa many other places arya samaj and punjab also sometimes the hindu punjabis they are the supporters of the followers of the arya samaj he visited calcutta and after visiting calcutta he understood that he used to give talk in english in sanskrit sorry he used to speak in sanskrit then he understood that the sanskrit the ordinary people they won't understand and that's why he started after visiting calcutta he started giving lecture in hindi and when he was in banaras and giving talk in hindi and sanskrit the one gentleman told him why don't you record it publishes a book form then only it will be a permanent so he started giving the talk recorded it and then published in the book form that is his only book is called satyartha prakash satya artha prakash the light of the truth then on the lead of only 59 years and he was actually killed assassin when in bombay a group of people invited him to have a dialogue with the balabacharia people balabacharia is a duitin so in india it was that still today maybe they're there they'll be inviting the scholars to have the debate you want to spread some special philosophy your idea we like to listen and we like to argue with you and if you can convince us that is the call the debate the bach they will call it as a war of the words he went over there and we can understand that the saraswati was very rajashik and he wanted to establish that hindu religion why because that time the conversion into christianity and islam was rampant he wanted to stop that conversion and how to stop that so he started telling you need not to go to temple and worship the images now a group of people they were christianity and islam they naturally they don't like the images and some group of the christianity so there no images there is to criticize of the image worship and dwan and the told why we also don't worship in image so he started telling up from the quoting from the vedas particularly yajur veda omkara was the object that he gave now you should meditate on the omkara and prayer should be he made the quotations from the upanishads and the veda that should be the prayer offering the milk all these type of rituals he developed to protect the hindus and not to get converted not only that afterwards a group of people they in his same they wanted to get back those who were converted they should also come back so then and he was doing like that when he went to bombay to have a dialogue with this people ballabacharya they didn't turn up though they invited him he went to bombay but these people didn't come to have the dialogue because he was a very forceful speaker another group of people came that is prathanasamaj arya samaj prathana samaj theosophical society and all these brahma samaj they all at that time when suramar krishna was trying to establish the sanatana dharma how he was trying to establish by practicing and then realizing and then only telling people there is god you can see god you can talk to god that is hindu dharma what is religion religion is nothing but realization and realization of the truth exactly siram krishna did that his approach was completely different but at his time in india to protect hinduism so many samaj came means society and the one of the society was arya samaj and they banished idol worship worshiping image no not necessary why to counter the christianity and islam but sudan krishna didn't do that he worshipped goddess kali brahma samaj they also said that you need not to worship the image the pure vedanta is sufficient they all quoted from the vedas they were taking the their material from the vedas prathana samaj in the same way and these are samajis they were also having this they gave the omkara then what was the philosophy god is truth and consciousness he is the bliss formless omnipotent just merciful unborn and he is unchangeable beginningless incomparable support of all lord of all omnipresent eternal holy creator of the universe so that was there of course that is the basic of the hinduism vedas are repositories of all the true knowledge all acts should be done in accordance with the dharma that is in the veda prime object of arjaya samaj is to do good to the world and that is what is the arya samaj and then he was the founder of the ariya samaj salam krishna meet him salaam krishna knew him krishna also talked with him talked about from distance so sirama krishna's conversation understanding about that and the he didn't mention in that way then afterwards god has created so many things and that in this is speaking the pundit in banaras the pundits had great discussion with the dhyananda that is the tradition if you want to say if you want to establish any new philosophy you must have to come to veneras you have to fight with the pandits the scholar sanskrit scholars of that place and then if you can defeat them shankaracharya came shankaracharya also established the advaita vedanta he had lot of discussions debates then only people accepted him similarly dhyananda went and there is the most modern time the pundits were there they are also hindus they also read veda but the way dwanando wanted to join the saraswati wanted to convince them they didn't like so this pundit who is reporting to sudama krishna about the debate that took place between the dhyananda and the scholars of the they said they made it so hot for him that he thought the only way to save himself was to was by running away he left that meeting and he ran away all the pundits shouted with one voice whatever the ananda has said is to be despised is not worth not teaching that is they're here they're mentioning in this way now that gentleman is again mentioning isaac cardinal alcor ii the theosophists believe in the existence of the mahatmas they also speak of the lunar solar all the planes a theorist can go in his astral body to all these planes god said many such things wealth said what do you think of theosophy now another philosophical group you know the theosophical group society it was formed in new york u.s november 17 it was the theatrical society was formed and the the first that the founder of the theosophical society was helena petrovona blavosky cornell henry still all cut blabuski was from russia cornell alcott from america william quam judge and 16 others that was the first their main object was to gather different information from the vedanta then mahayana buddhism then qabala and sufism they were mystic type they used to think that the great power is there if you pray to them you can without anything your astral body the subtle body you can travel all over the world anywhere you like not only that you can go to lunar sphere you can go to solar sphere to sun to moon that was their idea the theosophy they took that name from the greek word the theos means the divine and sophia means the wisdom theosophy means divine wisdom and divine wisdom that is also that when the blobsky died in 1891 the society broke why because one person the cardinal all card and another supporter annie basanth they complained that the another gentleman the founder member this judge he has forged the letter from the mahatmas look at it the mahatmas means the great soul you cannot see them but if you are praying they will come they will give you the guidance etc etc religion so many different ways it comes in the mind of the people so many different ways that's why shankaracharya is that verse is so important with the blessings of god only one can get the three things one is the manuscript this human birth mom that means in the past life the good karma the swathika baba the pure bhava so the desire to know god that comes mumukshatu then finally maha purusha-samastraya a good guide in the name of religion i i here only the two different people they mentioned one is the ananda saraswati very good people but the way they approach we all know it is and is available one can read very interesting but that is a different approach and of course these now in the near the in chennai the madras in india the headquarters is still there anniversary was a very powerful speaker and very literally one gentleman they chose a very young boy they chose that he will be a great atma carrier he will be the carrier of the great mahatma so they trained him so that the great mahatma from himalaya will come and then he will make that boy when he will grow up a young man so he can tell the truth etc after growing up he gave up that organization and started giving the talk and he is jiddu krishnamurti krishnamuthi is a very famous man he speaks about the vedanta and many people they like him now let us conclude with the remark of bhagavan sriram krishna our first pandit who came to suramar krishna after visiting the banaras and gave this report that he made the ananda saraswati and also the cardinal all cut and then asking this question well sir what do you think of your answer is the one essential thing is bhakti the one essential thing is bhakti loving devotion to god do the theosophist seek bhakti they are good if they do if theory makes the realization of god the goal of life then it is good one cannot see god if one constantly beases oneself with the mahatmas himself is making the word mahatma why you are thinking about all this and the lunar solar and all that planes a man should practice sadhana and pray to god with a longing heart for love of his lotus feet he should direct his mind to god alone with drawing it from the various objects of the world and sometimes we receive the questions like this bhagavan sirama krishna said after 100 years he will come again has he come can we go and see him whether the direct disciples of sudama krishna also have taken the form in this modern world how can we know and sometimes someone will say we know i know the surama krishna and these direct disciples they have come over here why see the energy we are unnecessarily wasting cerama krishna is present in this book that is sufficient what is sidana krishna an ideology an idea and the ideal that ideology is present in this book every page every paragraph every line of this book the gospel of krishna krishna is not the sram krishna his picture is there his words are there his instructions and guidances are there and now it is left to us to understand and accordingly make our mind successful and happy sudama krishna after this he sang a beautiful song that indicates how are you trying o my mind to know the nature of god you are groping like a madman locked in a dark room a mad man he is not having the sense and he is trying to find out something in a dark room is almost impossible thing so we
