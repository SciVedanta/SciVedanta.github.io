[395. Panchama Veda - "Stages of Sadhana‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFoSfxt4MSQ)

namaskar and their devotees and Friends after two months vacation we are meeting let us begin with the prayer with them [Music] [Music] usually the Vivekananda vedanta Society of Chicago we keep it close because of the extreme weather the winter in January and February so this time I went to India after the pandemic that was the first time visiting India I had a great opportunity to meet many of our brother monks and the devotees the old Associates and I traveled from Delhi then the K3 in Rajasthan is a beautiful the center the Swami vivekan this the disciple the king Arijit Singh he has donated his old Palace to the ramakrishna mission and it has newly reconstructed the government with the help of the archaeological Department of the government of India as beautifully as it was at a time of King Arijit Singh and Swami Vivekananda and it is really beautiful and they made a place to go and see all these and after that the Delhi Asama and then the belur mat kamarpuku jairambati mayor Bari in bhagbajar and the kashipuri narendrapur goal for ramakrishna Mission like there's so many places and the some of the new centers also I have visited that is in Krishna nagar and nabad deep and these are the centers we had a beautiful and the devotees meet in the baharampur that that's the first place where the ramakrishna mission activity started with the Swami akhandananda ji Maharaj so we had a nice time uh other naturally we are monks wherever we go we talk about the God we talk about the spiritual and religious life religious practices so I had a wonderful time spent all over there and now from today today is the first Wednesday of this month March 2023 as usual we will be studying the gospel of sirama Krishna the Pancham of Veda as I call it you know that the first week is a very busy time for me because the very fast Friday of every month we give classes on the bhagavad-gita arranged by the vedanta study circle of Nepal and they're not very far from here from our asthma at Homer Glen and the first Saturday we go to the Hindu temple Lemont and there we study the kapila upadisha the sons advises to his mother that is a series is going on and that is called the fragrance of vedanta many of the vedantic book we have discussed and now at this moment kapila upadesha we are studying first Sunday of every month or we go to the Bengali Association of Chicago and there we study kathamita and second Tuesday I give a class on the bhagavata organized by davidanta Society of New Jersey and then there are other classes the Skype classes like the Minneapolis Minnesota and the Hansville and like that almost so many classes every month and that is exactly our work that we do over here so now today we will study the gospel of sirama Krishna the English book the page number 792 and the Bengali published by the udbodan that had page number 815 last time before closing we discussed about that but let us begin with the same thing ah but as because it is very very important because bhagavan sirama Krishna he is mentioning that during the stage of sadhna one should describe God by all his attributes so this is very important you know that some of the people sometimes what do they do they do not understand the what the way they should practice and when the Hinduism as we we all know there are major three paths that we follow to reach God the same Hinduism but there is a path of the vedanta vedanta the vedanta has three schools advished and dweta and dueita means too that means Duality God is there and I am here is devoteevita explained the same thing in a different way and pure advaitha there is no God the conception of God it is only the Atman all pervading this is all philosophy how they have explained it but any path any philosophy that we follow that takes us to that same Bliss same uniqueness where we become eternally blissful and that is very important and bhagavan sirama Krishna his uniqueness is he's traveled through all these three and also he has traveled through the Tantra and the dwightism vaishnavism Etc so this bhagavan sirama Krishna he is mentioning he is not just the theoretical he was very much practical he practiced it and he realized that the truth and then he declared that from any path any way you can reach to the same goal and that is very important you know the different people have different aptitudes attitudes the the way of understanding so they should think that this is my best way I should choose like we choose the signs and sometimes the different type of the subjects we choose in the schools and colleges and here in the Hinduism a complete the freedom is there to choose your path but sirama Krishna is suggesting that one should prepare oneself otherwise without preparation if one goes to the ultimate path that is the advaitha vidanta is very difficult he may not be able to practice anything so he is telling during the stage of sadhana this is the word we should understand stage of sadhana sadhana means back to austerity satana means the practices by which we can reach to the knowledge the knowledge of God knowledge of Oneness that is called sadhana in Sanskrit that is the study that we do the practices that we do ah the experiments that we do that is the way we go to that particular stage that is called sadhana and that there in the beginning one should describe God by all his attributes attributes means gunas again in Sanskrit is called Guna aguna means he is good he is merciful he is all powerful he is all pervading these are the gunas and in philosophy we say if something is having the gunas the qualities the attributes in that case it is limited so these are all the philosophical thing and the circularity of the philosophy and then describe if it is the temporary the God is also temporary if I am practicing and reaching to the God then my realization will also be temporary in the next creation again I have to come but some say no we should go beyond that too beyond that this Duality so let us find out who is the actual original and they say the parama Vishnu the para Vishnu that means there is a Vishnu which is having the attributes the gooners the qualities and he is creating he is sustaining and he is also dissolving so this creation but because he is active he is having the qualities the he must be limited so go beyond that that's called para means the highest beyond that nothing is there and death it is not having the qualities then where from the school it is coming from him this is the thing that we have to understand gave the wonderful example he is unique in giving and a so simple way if one is having the qualities it is limited obviously the human being may be leaving 100 years but the God will be leaving millions and millions of years but still it is limited after some time they have to consider oh there is nothing again the creation begin again we come again the whole thing repeated like this but those who want to go to beyond the circle of birth and death they follow the advaitha vidanta and there they go to that Source from where all these things are coming and they merges into that and that is the end that's called mukti that's called Nirvana mostly by the Buddhist they use the word Nirvana and the Hindus they say mukti it is not the swarg it is the mukti so these are the conceptions now when one is not ready just beginning his spiritual life if we say that there is no God and there is no quality and you are the only Soul you are completely free you don't understand rather you will misunderstand and his character is will be completely different he will misunderstand and accordingly his spiritual life will be a completely um we can say not proper so that is the point bhagavan sidama Krishna is mentioning over here the very first line of the page 792 he is mentioning during the stage of sadhana when you are preparing for that when you have started the journey now there are two things one is the creator another is the creation understanding this too clearly is called religion it's called religious life and to understand this that there is a Creator and this is the his creation to understand this there are different type of methods have been developed in different places at different times people develop that and someone who has developed it called Avatar Incarnation Son of God messenger of God like that but this is nothing but a process and that is why I like that wonderful divination of Swami Vivekananda that he has given about the Dharma the religion he said religion is a process that makes a prudent to man man unto God and sorry the the process means the system brute unto man means is a person who was completely selfish lives for himself never cares others it's just selfish this is like a brute the word the swamiji used person when he comes in touch with the religion start feeling for others compassion for others wants to help others pray for others that's the human and then finally same person evolved into developed into pure love love for each and everyone love for all creation that is called God God is nothing but love and that is why the all the time the Hindus they say we should not fight about God God is there God is full of love and there we are reaching from different paths what is the harm but here the sudama Krishna is giving the stress on the practice in the beginning let us begin with duality that is beginning that God is there and I am here God is my father I am a son or God is my mother I am a her son a children we are all children of the mother so this is the conception then when we are doing that that gives helps us now he is mentioning here the one day hajra said to Narendra now those who are studying the gospel of sirama Krishna this panchama Veda you all know about these people the hazrat Narendra Narendra who became very famous afterwards as Swami Vivekananda he was 17 18 years young boy when he used to visit the dakshinesh to bhagavan sirama Krishna there was another person was related to bhagwan's ramakrishna he also used to stay over there and you know in religion the people most of the people the start the life but after some time they start thinking that after studying some scriptures oh I am a man of knowledge and they start giving advices but most of the time as because they are not practicing and realizing so they give wrong advices so bhagavan Cinema Krishna is pointing to this type of wrong advices and he is telling one day azra said to Narendra God is infinity infinite is his splendor do you think he will accept your offerings of sweets and bananas or listen to your music this is a mistaken notion of yours Narendra at once sank 10 fathoms Dosh heart in Bengali that means he was thinking the young boy he was thinking that I am singing to God and God is listening to my prayers that I poured to him through songs and I offer the whatever it is possible for me and to God and God is accepting it and I am receiving His blessings so naturally that way the life was growing the faith was developing then suddenly when a person the Aged person if he says like that what the young person will do whatever the husband said is also true then true from the point of view up Advanta Pure vedanta where there is no two but again we have to remember to reach to that height of understanding that God is only Consciousness and nothing else is all pervading consciousness we need to practice and step by step we can go to that higher conception where knowledge so sirama Krishna of any heard Narendra sang so I say to hajra because sirama Krishna was slowly helping Narendra to grow a leader of the spirituality and he should be completely in a well grown up into that when the boy lost his faith and he was thinking my God so many days I am singing to God I am praying to God and offering the consecrated food to God all the waste so this type of doubts the Hat will destroy the spiritual path spiritual Faith sidhama Krishna immediately protecting this young devotee and abusing this azra you villain where will these youngsters be if you talk to them like that how can a man leave if he gives up devotion this is a very important line to remember if we don't have the devotion then how can we live what is there in this world and in a one in a Sanskrit the sloka it beautifully says they are all common the animals and the human being everything is common they become hungry we too become hungry and they also sleep with two sleep they feel angry we feel angry pashu means the animals and the Nara means the human being all these things are very common then are we the same with them no there's a specialty that makes us a great difference what is the difference that Dharma dharamina when the human being when the Human Society they give up that particular Dharma yet the Dharma cannot be translated as religion means the core of the human soul what is the core of the human soul that is the knowledge understanding and that takes us to love and text makes us completely unselfish and which is the God God is nothing but love and unselfishness complete and selfish and it is not possible for an animal to behave like that practice that they have love but very very little they have a little sacrifices the mother will bring the food the the bird mother bringing food for that that is okay that is there but very very limited and for the human it is also there but when they go on developing that growing that love and then they become able to embrace the whole Humanity whole creation good bad and everything they are going to accept it that love called Divine love and that person becomes Divine sometimes we call some person as bhagavan like I am addressing sudama Krishna as bhagavan's ramakrishna what is this bhagavan that complete love and unselfishness is present in that person that is called bhagavan sirama Krishna is mentioning and he is rebuking that person that you should not behave like that the teachers those who are giving the discourses those who have taken up the responsibility to make the society Human Society understand religion they're studying the scripture and then describing it to the society as a teacher they must be very very careful they should know with whom they are talking maybe grown-up people maybe well-established people may be very intelligent people educated people but their children at the when they are understanding religion so they don't have the conception of the religion so the teachers should understand that otherwise they'll be a great problem instead of helping them we will destroy their spiritual life that is why bhagavan sudama Krishna used to close the doors and windows to tell the ultimate truth of vedanta to the younger people those who are capable to understand it so that is the category is there sometimes some people they understand mathematics so easily they understand the and they feel this is so easy and but the mathematics is a nightmare for many students they don't understand anything of it so we have to understand how to deal with them the students so here the sudama Krishna is teaching how can a man leave if he gives up devotion no doubt God has infinite Splendor here he is mentioning No Doubt God has infinite Splendor yet he is under the control of his devotees there is a beautiful way he is mentioning this is the when the moment we say that the God is under the control of the devotees is the complete faith that there is some power whom we can call God the dad God is all powerful all merciful and he is the creator but at the same time he loves the creation the king is all-powerful and he can do anything but at the same time the same King he loves to listen to his babies when that baby the little boy will come to the Father the king King never thinks that I am the king he thinks I am the father affectionate father and the child will ask the king to sit on the floor for him and he will play on the lap of the father King will do that and when is the king cannot do that King cannot see it on the floor like ordinary people that is wrong so that love can make even the Creator behave like that that is the faith that is called devotion and this devotional path is easy and majority of the people can reach to that ultimate truth which is so peace which is love through this Duality why to disturb their mind why to disturb their faith so this is the everyday morning you should get up and remember the god look at the picture and the images of God of our pranam do these do that and control your emotions control your anger and all those things and slowly slowly purify your mind what is the Purity purity of Mind means giving the mind to God and stop thinking about the world creation which is temporary that is purity here bhagavan Cinema Krishna teaching us that God is under the control of his devotee a perfect knower of God and the perfect idiot have the same outer science outer science a perfect idiot he is mentioning the word idiot means he doesn't know anything you won't believe God he is not offering food to God or offering his respect to God doesn't mean that he is a perfect person but in nowhere of God also knows the God is within me I am he as the vedanta says I am that Supreme who I am going to worship who I am going to offer flowers or food I am that so his behavior is completely different you won't visit Temple you won't sit for meditation he is not offering the food and anything to anyone the God because he thinks that I am that that is the science of the perfect knowledge but the idiot who has not realized anything me also says that I am not going to offer food to God or flowers to God I am not going to meditate on God it doesn't mean that he is a knower of God so this is the difference maximum light excessive light blinds us we can't see in the light if it is excess and the same way we can't see in the Darkness but two are not same darkness is Darkness the similarly bhagavan sidama Krishna is mentioning those who perfected themselves they become one with the Creator and they feel it is not necessary to worship because they are but in their behavior complete change would be there to the same thing the Arjuna the great famous in the Mahabharata that Arjuna was asking bhagwan Shri Krishna how I will differentiate how I will recognize a man of knowledge at the end of the second chapter in a many very wonderfully the god the bhagavan Krishna he is mentioning and he goes on giving the how you will understand a perfect man a man of knowledge he realized Soul the very first thing he said he will have no desire for the worldly objects means giving up renounce and promise perfectly there is nothing in this world that a perfected person will desire means the desire how you will know a perfected person that he will not have any desire anything no subtle desire or the gross desires anything of this world he is giving a stress on that sarvan oh no I like food oh no I like this no not like that nothing will be there that is the beginning of that so there are qualities by which we can understand and it's mentioning this a man cannot renounce action as long as it desires worldly enjoyment now he he is giving us that teaching action means we get up in the morning after the evolution we go to the Shrine we go to the temple and we sit over there pray to God meditate on God offer food and flowers to God these are called spiritual actions religious actions karma karma means actions what type of karma we do this type of karma then you go out and help the poor and needy people actions then you study the scripture actions we meditate as actions so all these actions are necessary to become perfect because why because we have the desire a man cannot renounce action as long as he desires worldly enjoyment now here we have to be very sincere we have to be truthful to ourselves have I truly given up all desires you have to go and stand before a mirror and ask yourself you need not to announce to the public rather ask yourself have you given up desire so there are they say that there are Asana in Sanskrit they say ishana it ishana desire what is the Asian as location Al right that ishana means the wealth the people they want the reach to become rich the world they go on thinking on that acting on that and if he says I am God myself I am the Atman at the same time running after money running after the name and fame is an hypocrite he is not telling the truth and he is going to reach nowhere in the spiritual Realm that is true if you want to be happy in this world be happy if you think that you should grab the power the wealth and you should rule over others hundreds and thousands have already done and nothing wrong in it for you to do that but if you want to know the God if you want to go beyond the circle of birth and death well then those actions have no desired because you are going for the temporary enjoyment temporary power temporary name and fame everything temporary where are those great Kings they are only in the pages of the history if you are not reading the history they are nowhere you are not remembering them they are nowhere the great Alexander if we are reading the history then only we come to know otherwise no there is nowhere so this is the way we have to understand the futility of this worldly life temporarily you will get joy but permanently it is very painful so the physical power physical Beauty is also temporary the name Fame temporary wealth temporary and all these things belong to the world and that's why they say in sanskriti jagat jagat means this universe this word there are only two things that their name name and there should be an identity and roof a form that's all Nam Aruba that is called jagat and this name and fame if you have then you should do some action spiritual action religious action otherwise you cannot overcome friends again and again I feel like telling that these are the teachings only for those I repeat only for those who want to go beyond the circle of birth and death otherwise you need to listen to these talks you need not to read the gospel of sudama Krishna or you needed to read any spiritual books be happy and that will be all right after the experiencing again and again and again the same thing there may be one day it will Dawn in the minds oh what I am going on doing the same thing I am repeating because sometimes we like to go to the merry-go-round but after say 10 15 rounds then what I am doing the same thing going on do we stop and get down of that and if some people they like to go for 100 times let them go let them enjoy this is not for them those who have come down of that those who have understood that is the same Circle we are going on Life After Life taking the birth growing up eating enjoying something then dying suffering and then dying again taking birth it is going on again and again and again my great great great grandfathers they have done the same and I am also doing the same my children my all these those who are following me in my family same thing will be done again and again when you understand this to where we are going in the same Circle we are running Life After Life then come out stand out and your Spiritual Journey Begins from there then you open the pages of the panchama Veda the gospel of sirama Krishna and listen to the words of the bhagavan sirama Krishna and who says prepare yourself and how to prepare through prayer through meditation through the devotion and the step by step when you are growing and you will feel I and the object that I am worshiping are the same and the object that I have kept as the Hindus they always do may be a photo may be a statue and different type of statues different type of photos different to the gods and goddesses whomever I like then some of the qualities of that God that is there described in the scripture I liked like the SRI ramachandra kept his word I have given the word I have promised I must keep it it is a unique idea I must follow that your spirituality then start developing on that line this is the truth that I should keep I have renounced everything kingdoms of the kingdoms are conquered but I have not taken anything of it that is Lord Krishna is the tyagi and he is giving up everything Sometimes some people say Krishna bhogi now that is his quality thiaga he could become the Supreme King of the that did in India no he gave up everything but that way if we can and if we see the life of bhagavan sirama Krishna very humble at the same time so pious he's truthful he is devoted he is full of love and compassion for the beings he is no differences of a rich man or a poor man a very learned person or illiterate no no differences no caste only the person who is thinking good sirama Krishna was with him with her so like this we have to understand the spiritual life then sudama Krishna is mentioning sometimes people they try here and here and here and giving an example of a bird who sat on the Mast of a ship and it were sleeping in the meantime the ship sailed and when the bird woke up he found that it is in the middle of the ocean he tried to reach the soul first he went to the east no so came back then to the west to the north to the South when all the four quarters he it found it is only water and no land then it came and settled down on the Mast where it was knowing that I am going to some place someday it will be all right and his mind become completely calm so Santosh what we achieve after the practicing of the religion santosha containment if there is no containment in the life of the spiritual spiritual life then why should we practice it in the worldly life there is no containment because there is no end of it if you become one officer you like to be the topmost officer and even after becoming that after the retirement what I am going to do again you are going on uh the keeping the touch with the higher authorities who can help you to become another person that we see in this worldly life they have achieved but they can't stop over there because desire then they will become some of the representatives these that and when they are dying still this this satisfaction or I could not reach up to that always dissatisfaction you go to the rich people they are dissatisfied because they are comparing with other rich people look at that his name is on the top so I couldn't reach over there maybe a millionaire but still he is buying for the billions and trillions and like that it goes on never stop it says so correctly you can neighbor you can never control your desire by enjoying the desire no it goes on increasing so you have to give up someday when you decide to give up that is the spiritual life the religious life so there are two things Creator and the creation when you are giving up the Creator the god you are enjoying his creation welcome but you have to suffer in the beginning there may be some enjoyment but mostly suffering but when you understand that and turn back and start going to the Creator in the beginning it is very bitter very difficult as because you don't have anything right there you have to wait a lot because it is very subtle because it is all satisfaction in your mind santosha that containment will come after practice and practice for that you should have to have a great faith and faith is the as they call it Sanskrit fit in the words of the gurus and of the scripture so here we are having a guru and a scripture Guru is bhagavan sirama Krishna the scripture is his advices instructions that is recorded in the gospel of sirama Krishna whom I call panchama Veda they it says that the free from the Oris it becomes santosha there's a beautiful story in the punishad also the two birds the one was quietly sitting and another verse hopping from one branch to another and tasting different type of fruits and sometimes beaters sometimes Swedish that is exactly the our life we sometimes enjoy and sometimes that we suffer I went to Darjeeling and when we are coming down from The Darjeeling we found a couple the newly married couple and in a another hired vehicle they were going somewhere maybe to give a party somewhere and some of their friends are also falling they are also in the hired vehicles and very dilapidated and very dusty road but they were all enjoying thinking we are going to enjoy I was thinking well this enjoyment for few days then there will be hardship and you have to earn a lot of money and for that you have to go here there earn then you become old then the same reputation of the story that we have seen in the lives of our father and uncle and all the neighbors near the beginning there's a good which seems to be good we think that is good but the only thing that we have to satisfied and satisfaction comes after renunciation so that it says bhagavan is teaching the captain Oh what an illustration the master is telling worldly people wonder about to the four quarters of the Earth for the sake of happiness what is the goal of our life happiness we marry for the happiness we purchase houses for the happiness we do everything in our life but the happiness we go to the picnic we go for the some places to visit all for happiness but that happiness is very temporary they don't find it anywhere they only become tired and ready went through their attachment to the last and gold they only suffer misery they feel an urge toward dispassion and renunciation most people cannot renounce the last and Gold without enjoying it there are two shots of people now is ramakrishna is mentioning those who have decided to become start the religious life that are again two the one type of people they go on visiting different holy places the pilgrims they will be going in different places those who stay in one place then those who go about to many places both of them one will be sitting in one place and he will be regularly maintaining a routine and slowly slowly developing a satisfaction but another will be visiting different places and meeting different people and discussing about different of subjects also trying to find peace and happiness by that way there is two but what is there to enjoy in the world the last and goal that is only a momentary pleasure one moment it exists in the next moment it disappears the world is like an outcast sky that steadily poured down rain the face of the sun is seldom seen there is mostly suffering in the world on account of the cloud of Lost in gold one cannot see the sun some people ask me sir why has God created such a war is there no way out for us I say to them why shouldn't there be a way out take shelter with God and pray to him with the yearning hurt for a favorable wind that you may have things in your favor if you call on him with yearning he will surely listen to you this is a great Assurance the God is there the same thing the Lord Buddha is also mentioning the chatwari Arya satyani as the Buddha is the famous poem famous for teachings in the beginning of the Buddhism they learn that they teach the four what is that that this world is full of suffering and the second is it has a Cause the suffering as a cause because of the karma Palma then third there is a there can be stopped and there is way out this bhagavan Cinema Krishna is also mentioning the some people when they feel that there are suffering in this world then they turn and ask sir where is the way out and what is the way out have faith and pray that's all you have to have the great faith and God and pray to God but if you ask God give me one thousand years of life that is not possible in one human birth because anything that has been created with many different things is going to be broken down and the all these things will go out of itself that is a natural thing whole world including our body including ourselves are made of five bhuters and that is Hinduism it's not the somebody telling something from the heaven and we are falling is just like the scientist everything they have tested experimented and what is this creation is it made of five things and we can say matter in Sanskrit they get given the name Buddha what are the five Buddhas and mixing of all this Vibe is making all so obviously one day the five will part and it will break so you cannot expect the body will be like that Spirit may be so bhagavan Cinema Krishna is mentioning and if one takes the shelter with God and prays to him with great longing God will surely listen he will certainly make everything favorable the master his captain was sitting and he appreciated the illustration and the god makes everything favorable perhaps this parent doesn't marry thus he is able to devote his whole attention to God or perhaps his brothers earn the family's livelihood or perhaps a son takes on the responsibilities of the family then the aspirant will not have to bother about the world he can give one hundred percent of his mind to God so those who are having the support in the family that is the wonderful thing that is good so they if they want they can constantly pray to God give hundred percent unto God one cannot succeed unless one renounces last in Gold that is the only thing Karma kanchana Kama means desire because sometimes they it bigger the transit has lost and gold because the terrible desire so that is the main thing in every being it is there and you have to understand that this is the weakness you have to overcome that and to satisfy your desire you need wealth you need money so the last and gold Karma and kanchana has been used again and again what is the bondage Karma kanchana and where is the mukti not having desire to enjoy Karma kanchana this all um it is the mind only that makes a person bound or the help to liberate when we are thinking of the desire and to satisfy the desire we go for earning money we are bound by that and it goes on increasing increasing increasing so you can never come out of that because the desires as a very unique we can say a very peculiar thing that if the moment you have one desire and try to satisfy that immediately another desire will come and that will force you to do the another thing and slowly slowly without your knowledge you will be bound by the ropes of desires it's like the octopus it will first tie with one and then go on tying you the ashta Pasha as they call it the like the octopus are having the eight legs and they will be holding with slowly slowly with all the eight and when they hold you with all the it you are dead the same way is there Pasha means the rope and by which we are tied the syrama Krishna is making us aware of it what you will eat what you will wear where you will leave it doesn't matter at all but the people are so much giving attention to all this things which has no value in the spiritual life the don't care to understand and the main bondage is lost and gold are this desire and the wealth so this is the bondage and that is called the papa papa means the scene it is not what you are eating oh he is sinful because he has eaten on this thing on that particular day in all religion there will be slowly some people they develop like that or today is Friday you are not supposed to eat these and if you have taken that then you are sinner you won't be able to realize God it has nothing to like that some people say this day we are not going to work because it is not allowed by the God and some people will say we should not do this we should not do that these are all afterwards some people according to their wishes they have developed that's why the gospel of sirama Krishna the gospel bhagavan Cinema Krishna is mentioning the very truth and that is only one and that is called Lost and gold Karma kanchana that is the scene unless and until you come out of that there is no chance to realize God or to get the permanent happiness so it is going on some people live in the world even after attaining gyana he is mentioning that the one cannot succeed unless one renounces last and goal only by the renunciation is ignorance destroyed unless you are renouncing you can never get the ultimate Joy Amrita they again mentioned a word Amrita it is not something liquid the pure conception is there it is that is wrong it is called the satisfaction that is the Amrita you can never get unless you are having this the complete renouncing on what is the renunciation the renunciation of Desire that is the last and gold and Cinema Krishna and we will study it afterwards and from the page 793 thank you friends let us see if there is any question so the first question is from Akash sahibi he's saying I am doing bhakti yoga since one year now I wish to see my Lord whenever I listen to devotional music of Shiva I start to cry every day I Pro I pray to my Lord to give me darshan why doesn't he not come hmm see your duty is a that you are crying that is a beautiful thing that you cry for God so sometimes some people are too sensitive to emotional or anything they will be crying but that is not the cry for God you have to understand are you truly crying for God that's the first thing and if the tear comes for the love of God of course bhagava as bhagavan sudama Krishna said the he is going to realize it there is no not many days that the God will reveal himself to him the one year is a very good time but still you have to pray you know as long as we leave we pray and we that is the only thing that we can do whether the God will reveal or not that depends on the god I love God I remember God I pray to God I cry for God and that is the only thing I can do the child is crying for the mother that is the only thing the child can do the mother will come and pick the child up that depends on the mother so don't think in that way when the God is coming to reveal you go on praying and crying and devoting yourself for the love of God thank you she's asking in our daily life when we come across situation which is unavoidable the only way to escape from such situation is to stay false if we do so we will our Karma be affected the purposely if you are doing of course but sometimes when the people are in a situation where the life at a danger and there is no other way to save the life but telling the lies as in the Bhagavad
