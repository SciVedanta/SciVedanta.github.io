[140. Panchama Veda 140- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmT68iqbf-g)

good evening that is chant from the geek out that his guru be that they say that the wonderful slow curve that begins in the beginning itself the master Masha has given that sloka and the gospel of sera notation taluka calm rhythm topped achieve Onam go vvz item con Masha poem sovereign among golem three madatha tongue movie grinnell de bourree dodging ah master Masha three more he is now giving the description of the Tuesday December 18 1883 I am reading from 348 page of the gospel of Salaam o Krishna now here master Masha stirring the ceramic isne was seated in his room with his devotees and he spoke Heidi up dev in turn are takers love of God and renunciation the vi√±arock digger is a father of three lavinda not and he was at the end of his life you respect though he was a very rich man and he was in a very high position in the society too but he'd left all those things and he was practicing austerity mostly living on the ganges itself on a boat big boat houseboat and used to live over there say ramakrishna went to meet him the how a man who was so reach still having all those properties but he is practicing the spirituality ceramic is not appreciated highly and went and made and now he is talking about him pointing to the younger devotees he said Devendra is a good man but blessed indeed are those young aspiring who like sukadeva practice renunciation from their very boyhood and think of God day and night without being involved in worldly life so there are completely two different ideologies two different pictures there are modern people good people in the society but spiritual people they are completely different very young age they do not feel attraction for the worldly life sadhana Krishna is talking about them comparing with this they accomplished everything in this worldly life and then afterwards they think no there is nothing so they think they will practice spirituality they try to better the spirituality Devendra nautical was highly respected but he was of that type see Ramakrishna is very clear about it so he is giving this clear idea picture that this two type of people the worldly man always a some desire or other though at times he shows much devotion to God once Mathura who was entangled in a lawsuit he said to me in the shrine of Kali said please offer this flower to the Divine Mother I offered it and he firmly believed that he a team is objective if I offer the flower the faith of module Babu that he is appreciating but the faith only to achieve something but the worldly life so he is not criticizing but he is giving a drawing a picture the people who are genuinely desirous to realize God they will never do like this and again he is giving another example what devotion roties mother had how often she would used to come here and how much she served me she was in a bush Nava one day she noticed that I ate the food offered the Kali temple and that stopped her coming her devotion to God was one-sided it is not possible to understand a person right away the uniqueness of ceramic richness this he is not criticizing but he wants us to be complete so that we can go to God the path that we are following result all right but at the same time if somebody else is following some other patters also all right so that type of mental broadness openness that is necessary to become the Ramakrishna's follower you sometimes the people who come over here I always tell them you know the ideology of ceramic dish 'no ideology of ceramic is nice job all the embracing love he is not leaving anyone but he appreciates that psychology that mentality which in now we say Parliament of religion all religions are coming together discussing and as if we will exchange notes and then we will make a new religion all will lead together but this is not the thing thing is the conviction realization all paths are leading to the same goal and that is God and God is love I am thinking my path is the best but okay in the modern society I am not supposed to criticize you you two have the Liberty to follow go on but I don't appreciate that not like this I had the appreciation but I loved this path this lady about whom Ramakrishna was talking she was having the idea only the wish never bath is the best and majority of the people unfortunately they become that narrow-minded my path is the only one and if somebody else is doing something else oh my god it is not the correct so this what see Ramakrishna said it was a winter morning and the master was sitting near the East door of his room wrapped in his molluscum shawl he looked at the Sun and suddenly went into Samadhi we are discussing about ceramic Tichenor can you imagine a personality who many other people were observing not that somebody in a remote past he noted and that has developed so many ways no he was just a historical personality many people saw him many people they were not the devotee of sri ramakrishna they also observed and this speciality of ceramic they noted one doctor was there who's to come and examine the ceramic busines when he used to go into Samadhi the true Samadhi or not is to go and check like that is to put his finger on the eyeball can imagine and the master we was talking like this suddenly he looked at the Sun and he went into Samadhi how they could understand that is the Samadhi ceramic is Nagi's eyes stopped blinking and he lost all consciousness of the outside world master mache and others who were there they noticed it he is not blinking he's looking at the Sun and there is no consciousness in the body after a long time he came down to the plane of the Saints world raka Hejira aim means master Masha and other devotees were seated near him the Hegira he was a critic constantly used to criticize Ramakrishna any opportunity and he was also there he also observed he also accepted so that is why the names the master Masha is mentioning that this state of Samadhi is certainly inspired by love see Ramakrishna is giving a completely new view new eye to logic new ideas the moment we talk about the Samadhi we know that is the word that has come from the yoga version Patanjali yoga darshan those who are meditating withdrawing the census from the things objects and from there they go to Samadhi and there are two different types of Samadhi one is Saguna and ninguna one is holding something energies beyond that so this type of samadhi here he Sadam Oh Christmas mr. love also disposable why because the object is to reach the mind concentrated mind withdrawn mine to God and now here just because of the love one mind is getting concentrated and going to the God and forgetting completely losing all connections with the external world all the objects of the world mind and all the senses are withdrawn is it not Samadhi it is also possible so cinema Krishna introducing completely a new thing don't think only by sitting in one place and practice practicing yoga one can get the Samadhi through love also one can get this a lot the your goal is to get the Samadhi and Samadhi means cessation of all the existence of God in any form of the world cessation of the existence of the world in any form and that is called Samadhi and what remains here may be the form of God meaning without form the consciousness only so the mind is marching with one and that is called Samadhi the state of Samadhi certainly inspired by love then he is telling his own experience one at Shamburger they arrange the kitchen at not over koshimizu somebody is a place and not over Goswami in those days he was a very famous man and the kitten you know that in our society the kitten independent in American society also nowadays they do the kitten one or two lines will be going on chanting the new way of kitten is introduced here there I had a vision of Krishna and the gopis of Randhawa when the kitten was going on the sasame Krishna in the kitchen but particularly mainly based on the life of Shri Krishna so the Krishna and the gopis they'll be explaining through the song through the music all the activities of the Shri Krishna with the gopis in Brindavan and there he visualized he saw that that is the experience Krishna and the gobies I feel that my subtle body was walking with the Krishna she was completely Mars with that so when we think of that and there is no trace of worldliness no trace of senses is it not Samadhi but there is also that Samadhi may be in the form of Shri Krishna and he was thinking in that condition completely ingredie I and ours together he is to enjoy like that after the master had finished is that he again spoke of the ecstatic love of the gopis majority of the people when they would be reading about the gopis they think about the worldly attachment and associations like a male and a female it is not like that is completely love love for God and that God love makes you forget even your own body so that is the love of the gopis when the young northern Ghana came he never liked that in those days the people is to think that only the low caste people is illiterate people poor people they only become vishna bah they do not understand anything of the Shastras they only jump and cry and think the Krishna Krishna so like that once the Ramakrishna verse pointing to a picture where children know mahaprabhu is going and many other in the pictures there's so many other people they're also done thing and he showed it to a devotee Calcutta reject man you see how people they forget everything in the name of holy name of God they're singing and dancing that man told roughly said I know these people they're all locust people in leader eight they don't know anything that's why they have become this which never so that we can understand the very bad idea about the voice naver's we were there was no acceptance about that but Saddam Oh Krishna reestablishing this apparently he was the worshipper of Goddess Kali and just now he mentioned about the lady was the wish number and she stopped visiting the Ramakrishna when she noticed the ceramic Easter is taking the consecrated food the Prasad of goddess Kali and immediately she stopped coming or visiting or talking or expecting to see Ramakrishna so so narrow mind and that Saddam o Krishna in other way trying to establish the bushnell religion he told them that young narendra who was announcing it will know if you don't believe in those things okay but at least look at these even if it is a story but look the attachment to God the gobies and the main of them Radha the tremendous attachment and love for God they are forgetting everything never caring for the society also and they are going and listening to the song and they become in great joy in the company of see Krishna was the 8 years old boy at that time so they used to love him so much Sophie Ramakrishna is to say and he said you must think the devotional song you are thinking one and you say faith you must sing the devotional song to have that emotion had the devotion Saddam acacia had vowed to offer green coconut and sugar to this sherry the Divine Mother she initially Kali is the another name is Tonto naked body bhagwanti ramakrishna was nearby it is just near to show me be vacant on the spirit allows if you visit Calcutta you can see that place also small month temple so Kali temple and see Ramakrishna see just like a very very ordinary person he is going and praying to mother and say if you make him alright then I will offer you green coconut and sugar usually inside the coconut water they will put little sugar otherwise some gash or some problem comes from the coconut water so they mix the sugar it becomes this tea also so he promised that mother for our Rahul maharaja was the young boy used to stay with Ramakrishna he was not keeping good health Saddam Krishna just like the anxious father he prayed to that colleague not to Doc's National College think they should copy why the you get the immediate action Cynthia system is the success so she this Shahrukh Ali and you have to purchase the flower Swedes and also the green coconut sugar you need money then he told him there he asked him whether he would be for the offerings look at the the blessed man this master manager ramakrishna used to record himself is almost begging taking from him and when that another businessman came to give ten thousand rupees in those days ramakrishna changed amount go out from here so sometimes we really wonder some people they are rich but how come they don't like to give to see Rama Krishna because surrounding him so don't they care to take it they don't like to Saddam Krishna when he wants that I must take from him that means he has chosen him as his own otherwise you won't take the to give money even to give anything to God that also means some holy actions in the past life you have done something good then only God and the master Bosh I see Ramakrishna many times you say then this time is tailing master Mercia didn't mention that yes or no why he says I will purchase that for you that shows that that I am proud I am paying those things now he recorded everything but omitted that particular portion when Saddam efficient is telling he asked him him is the master master whether he'll prefer the offerings that he stopped but the next batter is begin that afternoon the master accompanied by M and Rakhal and some other devotees set out in a carriage for the temple of sedition in Kolkata on the way the offerings were purchased how master I said without disclosing who paid who portrayed it was purchased this is the humble way that one should give when you are giving to God you are humble and happy the has chosen you to give something on reaching the temple the master asks the devotees to offer the fruit and sugar to the divine mother he himself he actually promised to the mother but now he is asking the devotee to give it to him the mother wife look at it the man who goes into Samadhi just by seeing looking at the son the moment he saw he does on that light immediately goes into Samadhi that man full of knowledge and the yoga he comes into the level of an ordinary devotee and he now begging the mother for something that is please help my child the Rakhal was his son is a mind gone son he prayed for that and the Rahel came at the age of sixteen he came to see Ramakrishna samkisha accepted him as his son is to take lot of care and this is now when he reaches over the areas other devotees to do it so that you will get the blessings of the mother that is the way the Ramakrishna's to do and then they saw the priests and their friends playing cards in the temple see Ramakrishna said to play cards in a temple one should think of God here inside the temple one all I should think of God and nothing else we read in the life of Jesus Christ he changed the priests shouting don't make my father's house a business place he went to a synagogue and he saw the synagogue the priests they were selling different things they were talking about as we always see even in our temples also some of the people who I have taken the profession of ship so they are money and two are more money they always say if you do these it will be good if you do that it will be good and they are sailing and them giving some water or sometimes the flour and put flour over here and they chant something and then they will give you some paste or sample like this it is a business no devotion that's why cinema Krishna was not happy and Jesus was angry and he chased those priests with a stick in hand and he said don't make my father's house a business place so that mainly say that when you come to the temple your relation is only with the God and nothing else from the temple master going to the judo moon leagues house every rich man get the money in those days these are the people even up to 1960 the Bengali communities they are having a very rich community and both the things they were having that the worldly richness and at the same time culture and both things produced very good spiritual personalities also but this gentleman League they were the German there's their big business man they were having many things so all these things to have some people to talk all around this to bring some information about the market what is going on like this as the business community they always do the JD Malik was having but he had a great devotion for say Ramakrishna's to like him and loving Serrano Krishna also is to go to him and say dhamma krishna went over there do Moloch was surrounded by his admirers he welcomed the master mastered the smile see Ramakrishna was an ordinary priest in the Kali temple Judah Malik he was a very rich land on and look at it the relations ramakrishna is going and with a smile he said why do you keep so many clowns and flatterers with you he is asking that rich man these rich people they always like to have some people around them to always say Oh whatever you say whatever you have done they will go on telling like that Saddam Krishna's him to say like that and Judah only the relation really appreciate immediately he replied that you may liberate them I keep these people so that you can liberate them and then all started laughing master he commented flatterers thing that the rich man will loosen his part Springs for them but it is very difficult to get anything from him that's true with your horses have that experience when you go for donation but you in this country it is not like that but in India everything depends on the donation so I used to go to the minister's wish to go to the government officials or the Richmond is like this very very difficult to get and sometimes is to go to like this one lady she was very rich but in an accident she lost almost I told this story before she lost her from in-laws side everyone including her husband and the parental side her father's side also except her ailing father everyone died in it and car accident they went somewhere this lady and her father they were only society I don't know why I never knew heart I never saw her matter but she came all the way from Calcutta to Andaman Port Blair to meet me and she told I was supposed to come with an appointment but I don't my mind is in this condition everybody has left me what should I do - why - me you don't know me and now whatever he will say I will follow anyway afterwards I told her you better do in this way as because the business is in your blood don't leave it but learn English otherwise you won't be he'll be able to attend the meeting is a big big big business dollars so naturally you have to have the different meetings with different people if you always take the help of your managers they will take all credit other things also sometimes without your knowledge let me clear problem you learn it six months one year you will learn and then whatever you were earning that you distribute among your stuff there now your family you have she was having nearly four or five tea gardens - still factory and like that it will not so many up there all will be your family so you were to do that and she was very happy she was ok I will follow like that but only will get the peace because that is the way the ramakrishna be vacant dirty chisel and she used to give me some money almost like 5 lakhs she donated in different phases then one day whenever I used to come to Calcutta she still saying our God just to give the cart for my use just to take to her house like that so after this - then suddenly she - please come to my office and she said the car I went to her office she met me after some time I had to wait and then she told I should say something to you please don't mind and my guru ji and you had you never say that here in Brindavan in our family tradition so I never knew afterwards they came to know about him so I visited him our family guru in the Brindavan when I met him I told about you I told how you have asked me to do he said never give money to Ramakrishna mission and now guru ji has ordered so what to do I don't know yet to follow guru ji but don't ask the money that you have already given to me I cannot give it back to you right now so that is the first thing and secondly he was telling guru ji states you need not to help the other people if they suffer it is because of their karma pala don't paid an extra so what kind of grew Zi wanted to see but I had never had the luck to go so far he said don't help them you have to rule with this end of the strong hand she told from now onwards I am NOT giving any money to the extra money to these workers and all that so love is the very first thing if you don't have the love that then it is very very impossible and when that love comes when your idea is very clear there is only one God and they that God cannot be too but we need small babies looking at the father he looks in a different way when he young son he is looking at the father he looks the father in a different way the completely to put his two sons but one the little one he looks at his father in a different way and the grown up son he looks at the father in a different theory but it is only the same father similarly when we understand many things of the philosophy and metaphysical thing we look at God in a different way but that is the same God and some people just like the small baby like the kid they are grown up people but metaphysically or philosophically or spiritual knowledge they are very low so look at the same father in a different way I would go I would ask I will get the father to give me a protect me they go in that way there's nothing wrong so this is what the Ramakrishna is telling but for the spiritual purpose one should be always every time but the high spiritual value you must have to have that type of practices the MA the Ramakrishna is telling in a very clear way you try to go and flatter the rich people thinking that they will help you it is on unnecessary it on then the next day is the 19 December that was the witness day it was 9 o'clock in the morning so Ramakrishna was talking to him near the bell tree at Dakshin Isha so now that bell tree that area it was completely segregated only very courageous people could go and sit over there for meditation because snakes were there and all around so much of thickness of the trees even though sound is to come so there is an O Krishna practiced under the bell tree he practiced a Porsche and the master this aimed at teachers she also went and sat and ceramic is natima what they have made him and he was talking with him the master has given the description of the tree then afterwards the see Ramakrishna is talking to him one cannot realize God without renouncing last and gold is very clear one cannot realize God without renouncing last and you can reach in here you can have some clear idea of God you can have some visions also we can develop some miraculous power too but the realization of God is completely different which has been saved in a wonderful way jaha calm down here on this is calm movies desired Rama means God if you have the world it is there you can never expect to get the realization of God that completely two different light and the darkness you cannot have both together so that they say one cannot have the joy of the world things along with the realization of God sometimes some people they talk about why not you practice like that so many devotees are coming over there here is very few I could see whoever will come they will come but we cannot follow whatever they are doing it is good for them let them go but we have been trained in a completely different way our visions are different what we think this is all right for us very things here people for the spiritual thing they will come over here so there is no problem master Masha is asking why did not mushy stir say to Rama now he is arguing coating from the Ramayana the vashisht told to Rama what Oh Rama you may renounce the world if the world is outside God the Rama was thinking to renounce so vashisht Ramakrishna himself mentioned about it the Besiktas argument was all these with God God has created this world why don't you stay in the world and there lies God so that was the argument see Ramakrishna smiling and he is telling he saved that to Rama so that Rama might ravana rama accepted the life of the householder and married to fulfill that mission it was the divine play divine mission so that is the reason he said like that but in the bhagavad-gita again and again we see shades rational girl this is the completely two different thing Chaitra this worldly things that God has created nothing that got without God it is but that is not God God is completely different God has created that out of his own but at the same time it is not ye God is different so similarly Chaitra the field all the objects of the world and shaped rabiyah the knower of that is the god in the bhagavad-gita shri krishna he took those two terminology cetera and shelter gap a completely different when the Salam o Krishna told that the master master he was having the greatest radiation for God realization and he was thinking I can realize God living in this worldly life why not between son Krishna mentioned like that the Rama that was the instruction of his guru vashisht ur because he was having a purpose a mission now master Masha he is mentioning about himself aim stood there like a log stunned and speechless the tremendous desire to realize God that was in his mind so we can understand how much desire how much strong desire was yet to realize God and the moment he Ramakrishna said like that you are thinking then what will happen to me and then we will find how C Ramakrishna slowly guiding him said is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the impersonal God that is what I gave as a subject of today's discussion can one realize impersonal God that means the God in the from the line from the viewpoint of knowledge personal impersonal the personal God all these pictures of their images are there so many varieties of the three teachings are there options are there but run Denali impersonal nothing is there except you so obviously is it possible he is asking us because he was very strongly trying to understand this on the beginning from the first day when son Krishna acts him what is your opinion God wit formerly those form he said I think God without form how can this big God can be informed that was the first time Sadam again now again he is not living that any opportunity he is telling sir is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the impersonal God then the ceramic each nation yes there is but the path is extremely difficult after intense austerities the Rishi's of the world realized God as their innermost consciousness and experience the real nature of Brahman is very very difficult some people will be talking about the impersonal God the Vedanta that is the Brahman the consciousness the wonderful ways they can explain the Vedanta or three the Vedanta but if you go and talk to them they'll be criticizing others they are very careful about how others are doing an hour during the comparison and the that means they always want to get the appreciation from the world when you are talking this world is nothing when you are teaching that this world is nothing but temporary completely how come after the talk you think in this way that means you are only just intellectually expressing a view and you are getting the appreciation of the people who are understanding that in that way but in genuine practice it is not there so the moment we feel jealous the moment it criticize others the moment we think that see he is getting B's and dad to the philosophers there's only you are teaching but you are not practicing the practice is completely different and that is why it phase in the pancha - a famous book it says that komyatti dosha reached RDR komyatti there any desires dosha pristine you have to one should find defects in the world objects komyatti dosha dystopia commodity other heat of a then by after that after observing that you have to have that the other precedes the Emoji Shastri issue and moksha Shastra moksha the scripture about the liberation Mukti they teaches like that you have to give up and you have to find the fixing that we have seen in the ceramic dish now he is in many times not only practicing that at the same time he is stealing also in a Hubble bubble in those days it was the practice almost all the issue and naturally in Calcutta the rich people ways to have the hub for people is to have the Hubble bubble in the pure way but the rich people have a bubble made of the ivory gold or silver and they will be drinking in such a way half lying down and cinema Krishnan observed it because if he is to get the support from a rich man or food Babu then he told Mithu I also don't like to do it like that I want to experience how good it is whatever we immediately had instead it was nothing for the image so he waned and he lied down in a right side and he was smoking then the left side smoking on the back on the belly then afterwards you through that and they said mine this is Hubble bubble smoking the rich man they do and from apparently when you see it seems is so good but actually it is not not the rich man he cannot mix with people in a huge car he is going and the driver that is also covered he cannot see and either he is reading or he's on the phone you don't have any people to talk to then he goes and he goes to his room and maybe a chosen in one or two will come then like that but the ordinary people they have so many friends and they'll be going this way that way whatever they like they can do but there is so the total is aggregated person we think from distance audience such a happy person when you go here if you have to if you have purchased the first class and something like that then you need not to go in a line you can straight go very few people but those in the other ordinary classes economic class that will get one they to be three d the wind your number will come that time you'll only go you have to find a place to keep you bad and when we cross we see the first class people are sitting over there so comfortable up there they're not this time I got because for some reason I got the first-class ticket when I was coming I found by my side one lady was sitting all alone I told him came to this place all alone well who will come I'm all alone but I was living in a very good order they took care of me but she's all and she wanted to talk and she was going on talking with me I feel sleepy Hetal in the first class I should have a nice sleep but the problem is my kogas and Jesse wants to talk because there is no other thing to do for her so this way when you find apparently it seems that they are happy many of them are happy no doubt god this worldly object cannot give you complete happiness permanent happiness that is impossible that's what Ramakrishna is telling and easily yes there is but the path is extremely difficult after him thinks austerity of the riches he is giving them that instances of the olden times realize God as their innermost consciousness and experience the real nature of the money but an aspirant cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if we his mind is stained with the worldliness even in the slightest degree and what is worldliness selfishness the moment you have a little bit of selfishness even in the competition also I must realize God fast there's also selfishness comedies words revolutionary that the wonderful word he said easiest way to realize God to help others to do that can you imagine you are helping others to realize God while you are busy solving them easiest way to realize God to help others to do that that is called completely free from ego and when there is no ego then there is no selfishness and when there is no selfishness no desire of the world and when there is no desire of the world your mind be is completely pure and that is why I quote again and again the Jesus a blessed that those who are pure in heart why because he will see God for they shall see God what is this purity see Ramakrishna said slightest degree should not be there the mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form taste smell touch and sound look at it so when some people are doing something and then people are coming and praising him in Hindi this approach a way Mothma then you are done so I recently I met one late gentleman then he told after coming down from the Samadhi I have come over here do get it why he has to mention the Samadhi so that the people are impressed and some of the ladies you know come though our mothers are always emotional though they are in America they're educated ladies but constantly going on through him flowers flower petals at her feet wherever he is working and they also try to do it to me no not me whatever you do do with him he never said it need not do that because all the way in a very clean and tidy place of course they have paid they have hired that but we are becoming too making a dirty he is not thinking they are also not thinking this going on like that and every time he is coming he is putting that flower and again picking it up because not much of stock so the flower that is already offered they are picking it up and then keeping it and again some another ad is coming they are giving the same flower to give it like that it is going on and he is sitting and telling well I have come down from the Samadhi do you believe that immediately you remind that Ramakrishna says it is not possible never Eva possible that to succeed the slightest degree of this should not be there the pure mind is the same as the pure aardman the pure mind and the pure Artman at the same but such a mind must be altogether free from lost end goal what is the purity again and again is talk about the purity we go and behave in the Ganga the pure water we go and drink the Ganga water we do these we do they are thinking that we are becoming pure what is the ultimate what is that purity actually see Ramakrishna mentioned it last and gold in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna said gamma ish a crow the aja rajo-guna someone proper Maha Hashanah mahapadma within the Oba unum you should know this too is the real enemy for spiritual life so we do not know but at least after reading the gospel of the Ramakrishna one can get a very clear idea of spirituality and one can then afterwards judge to what I am going to do shall I take the path of the devotion or the work unselfish work or meditation or knowledge or all the food together I should practice so that we can must be free from Austin goal when it becomes pure one has another experience one realizes God alone is the door and I am his instrument so after realization of God what happens no he go at all completely because after the realization one can feel that it is only the God we is doing and no one else when Shami be vacant under after the great Trump over here he turned back to India even the great Kings also was trying his chariot walking and people thousands of them they were hailing Swami Vivekananda he told don't do that if you want to really give joy he'll give it to God he has the power to make Vivekananda like me Vivekananda in thousands if he wishes he has given me that opportunity so I am doing when Arjuna was not ready to fight and he was arguing with the god Krishna then the freakishness said whatever he was you see I have already done limits to Matra of a sub Casati manu in wait a neo da Hoover Mabel I have completed all these things that the war that you see is going to happen it is already done everything is done only you become the limited just I love you I want that world will praise you for this we are praising Vivekananda but was the power behind him that is ceramic is nur so next day we will discuss about something that is some ceramic Krishna is telling but the one Manasa body a completely new idea of the Samadhi that is now chant the preneur mantra knees and journalism hunter who pom popped on Kanta Rita Bikram by Aisha wat arum para misha medium tam Ramakrishna sheer asana Varma Oh [Music] Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you the 3rd shridhama krishna our eponymous to twenties then
