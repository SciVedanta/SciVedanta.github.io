[63. Panchama Veda 63: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOp6Bthd67M)

so so foreign are inseparable unless you accept shakti you invite the whole universe the world stands solely because the primordial energy stands behind it without giving up worldliness a man cannot awaken his spiritual consciousness nor can he realize god the prana krishna he immediately quoted from the mahadevan and he was telling us always compassionate so these these are the qualities that one should have to realize so this is the presentation these ideas must be assimilated we go through the scriptures this is very important unless and one can we assimilate the idea we use the religion before in any religion the most of the energy is spent on rituals we don't know any moment the more the complicated are the rituals and the dangers and the music the more we are attracting the more we go over there we do not understand what all of these so this is why is making only a small simple sentence he is studying these ideas must be assimilated then sinapu krishna is telling many people talk of kyana but their minds are always preoccupied with workings house buildings money name saints places as long as you stand at the port of the mountain that is in capital there is a water and environment the mountain is there so that monument over because that was the place where all the civilians used to live they never allowed the switching to infinity then you do not enjoy the buildings the carriage the horses the main they look like ants this around small things that means in the spiritual life the more and more and more they go upward the more towards god more towards brahman and all these worldly things become tiny small things and you will lose interest in that but the main thing that you have to renounce more you go up you renounce the worldly things without the renunciation nothing can achieve all such things as attachment to the world and enthusiasm desire of the detainment of there are instructions to realize now there's a lot of interest and all are not one two they have already written and there is ready please come and give a disclose then comes the cessation of all passions when the knock burns it makes a cracking noise and one sees the flame but when the burning is over and only ash remains then no more noise is armed similarly only when the people are practicing the austerity reading they are reciting they are visiting the temples and so many things are going on sound but afterwards when it is only burning no how it is possible to tell you also the moment someone says i have realized that yes the moment someone says i have not realized from one is also misunderstood so what is the problem these are the qualities the more you acquire those nearer you come to god the more you feel peace see if we read the gospel of krishna we give all the answers what is god realization what is if you don't want peace of without the peace the shanti and that is why in our shanti mantras in all the hindu scriptures the last they will repeat peace peace and from all corners you are able to think you are free so this is the things then immediately as it is the speciality of krishna he's giving an example the nearer you come to the ganges the more you feel his fullness you will feel completely smooth when you launch into and the 24 cosmic principles all exist because god exists without the god nothing can nothing remains if god is eliminated the number increases if you put many zeros after the figure one but the zeros do not have any value if the one is nothing without the god nothing remains and here god cannot be realized if there is the slightest attachment to the things of the world if there is the slightest attachment to the things of the world anything of i must have that if there is the slightest attachment while every religion is teaching that you must do some donation that gives some donation practice islam what is most closest to you dearest to you sacrifice them so here is the moment there is a knowledge what is that knowledge the god is the only real thing so they are never really desire that is the beauty the moment you know it is harmful obviously you won't touch it one of our performances are saying that if you will have the diabetes then only one exercise you must practice what is that the neck exercise the problem the knowledge has done then only you without the knowledge without the knowledge you cannot be free from themselves religion but by transforming how he's transforming he's sending his disciples his people everywhere just spreading the message of life asking people to give it to discussion through songs through the rituals by writing articles by saying books so many different ways that knowledge is reaching every corner of the world and people are attracted the organization 1897 is only 100 years we can say and thousands and thousands years so many things have been accumulated in the minds of the people in the name of religion so much of superstitions so much of marines and there are some people are there in the name of religion they're realizing their own or their own benefit utilizing religion sound in the name of politics some in the name of economy some in the name of so many other things so to remove those things look at the dawn every page is so interesting and the way she is talking giving the instructions excellent i think this is the best book now see how the mothers in a simple way entering into the heart of america so this is very very interesting way now if we are attached with this movement a huge challenge is already started moving we are going only touching the road thinking that we are pulling not that childhood is going in some way we are only holding it and thinking we are dragging those who will be holding touching that road and helping this movement in any way possible the truth what is the truth god alone is there so this truth that we manifest that we express within the heart when there is no other thoughts if there is other thoughts at the end then neighbor can come god cannot be realized it is the slightest attachment to the things of the world god is realized as soon as the mind becomes free from attachment again and again because this is the truth that's why he is beginning in his what is this attachment suppose i am very much attracted to my property and my name and name and to my keys and to will my dad if i want to continue the burger thing is there it will come i cannot hold it i cannot keep it it's going to go out of my hands so why not give it when you have that capacity to give so that is the best way understanding the truth that someday statistics we so this is the way we have to discuss we have to realize the truth whatever i have got maybe the honor maybe the money may maybe the physical beauty whatever everything is going to go so that's why my attachment when it is there okay no problem when it is so god is realized as soon as the mind becomes free from attachment whatever appears in the pure mind is the voice of god so that is the and what is the purebred unselfish one why what selfishness is purity we become this thing because the moment i goes today one lady was asking me what is that and the pure mind is the voice of god this is the beauty that which is pure mind is also pure and again is pure utmon this is words the pure mind is the pure and and no one can realize it someone has written is there any single soul in your order who has realized brahman because he is not having the conception what is so that is the reason you go and look at the life of those people whole life is nothing but sacrifice how they can sacrifice because they don't have what is the blue mind even we are hindus and i can remember that i think 1972 yeah 77 78 that time there was a great flower all over and we came to our headquarters we were on young publishers we went and touched the feet of the present president swamiji go to the villages and see the mothers and time children suffering because of the flower and he would like to take the comfort of sitting over here in the temple and after the puja he will take the bashar and then he will take his name and asked me to the relief daddy with you i have all the bad and like if you use everything are you sitting on the top so that is the idea forget about yourself don't care about that keep everything at the sacrifice of the great god please every human being why human being because manifestation of god is more in the human manifestation of god in april but the more in human being that is what see here is feeling free from the attachment so this attachment comes to these this pure mind this pure thought this compassion if this is not reality then what is purity if a person can attain that purity in the brain why because he was thinking his own countrymen thousands and millions of things and if this is not purity of heart what is god is realized as soon as the mind becomes free from attachment whatever appears in the pure mind is the voice of god that which is pure mind is also the pure good thing that it is because there is nothing pure but god but in order to realize god one must go foreign today is tuesday and sunday that will be moksha and you must accept the detachment there are two voids of these and here one is attachment under this detachment remember that is the son of navrati the son of narita mother is debate of discrimination and do an ask that discrimination that son what is the truth what is the ultimate what is god that is foreign and who who has is god and how are we know that he has realized god arjuna is asking this question is giving the answer everything is there in our scriptures how i will know one person that he has realized from him they realize so how do you know if he says i have realized from his decision is all when all the desires have been given up and the self find joy in itself then one becomes a person of steady so that is called realization of brahman and this is the latter that afternoon when since krishna was sitting in his room a few a businessman became one gentleman particularly he came and he asked sad what is the way how to live as well if now also if you go to rajasthan and those places if you go for painting any householder they will get the arms but before that they will ask traditionally tell him or her how to get this god so look at it very ordinary people but they are so conscious about that maybe that it has become a tradition they will ask then you will say and she knows that i have to worship god and this also but each way the conversation goes because obviously there's a way to your time because you won't be ever known so whatever you want to know immediately this person has come he has brought something up there are two ways one is the path of discrimination the other is the father devotion the discrimination and devotion but actually please analyze you find that within these two other two are also represented the dhyana means concentration and turn off this work if devotee is working for god every morning and they will pluck the flowers and they will do this so many work is their gleam on and the discrimination also is also working in a different way so the work and meditation is involved within these the two main parts of the part of discrimination but of devotion discrimination means to know the distinction between the real and the unknown it's very clear thousands of people are there immediately this is not true this is this you cannot argue because everything is so clear what is discrimination discrimination which are what is the permanent substance or else is illusion and important to what is real real means partner and what is unreal and now we see that is up all transitory enjoyment ranging from this body to the brahma good you are the creator in the hinduism that capacity is also typical even then it will change the brahma is changing so that's why he is telling the brahma is also chanting from one we have heard so obviously we have heard and then we spend all those time we clean when our stock is exhausted we come down also listening after that you have to come back so that is very very important we have so many wonderful things you should not be attached to that some people will come and they always speak in such a beautiful way everywhere in any city any country you go the same city only because of that because changes some of the changes people are little hard to see some places are dirty some places are clean so that way what they will supervise oh my god so that way you can immediately desire comes to move and you go this earth the kingdom they became the king when the good days came for her and also she remains now this is the time for me to go retire to the forest and prepare so that's why here krishna were firstly calling addressing arjuna as the attack of capacity so unless that discrimination and renunciation discrimination means richard and renunciation means the other renunciation means to have dispassion for the things of the world this passion for the things of the world that krishna is a spirit he is a spirit everything ever about him but the devotee the devotion because until there is a personal god because is away said what is the meaning of the worship of the personal god he is asking good questions and what is the meaning of god without so likewise the worship of the image reveals in a flash the nature of the reality the same argument we know that the divi was also the not believing the god in falls so naturally as because he was influenced by the brahmas almost all the young in those days they are remembering you as you are real so the picture hindus also by seeing the picture by seeing the images they remember not that particular so likewise the worship of the image reveals in a flash the nature of reality do you know what god which form bubbles is on an expanse of water so simple way but solving the great problem just like the bubbles on the expanse of water various divine forms are seen to rise out of the great archer of the consciousness the incarnation of god is one of these poems the prime energies force as it were through the activities of the divine incarnation what is dearing mere scholarship god can be attained by crying to him with a longing heart there is no need to know many things because many people without playing can be just for curiosity can be going on holding questions asking questions but not very serious about getting the answer negative the one lady asked the question and without waiting for the diploma she started talking with her friends you need to have any kind of education only you have to have a very long heart for god even if you do not know how god is but the longing for god is there when you cry then god will come there is no need to know many things he who is an archery has to know different things one needs is toad and shield to kill others but to keep oneself a and going for a debate you must know many other things otherwise it is very difficult so that is the reason one ultimately discover god is trying to know who these are is is this i the flesh the bone the blood or the man is it the mind or the analyzing does you realize at least that you are none of these this is called the process of needy name every sunday by reciting that famous queen of shankaracharya the heart money it is without qualities or attributes but according to the part of devotion god has attributes to a devotee krishna's speech is so simple explaining what is god and how to realize foreign foreign no it's is
