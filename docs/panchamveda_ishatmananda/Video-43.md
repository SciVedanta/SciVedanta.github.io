[44: Panchama Veda 44: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw5mbKUzPEU)

now let us begin today this is the gospel of sirama krishna we are studying there are two types of knowledge one is the knowledge of this world and that is mainly called the science and another knowledge is about the spirit the soul the self and that is called the spiritual knowledge is giving us that this is the spiritual knowledge and in this chapter shri more the master mahashaya the teacher who is to come to suramar krishna and he used to note down all the conversations he is recording a conversation between keshav chandrashin and his group of people with sirama krishna it was october 27th 1882 and we began in our last class we began over this and then we are discussing now sirama krishna he reached that boat where the keshav and his friends were there and he was mentioning soliloquism in a very wonderful way mother why have you brought me here they are hazed around and not free can i free them sirama krishna is a god himself and here that god he is also thinking whether these people will be able to understand me can i remove their ignorance so this is the depth of our ignorance so much the people they always think that i am rich i am educated i am influential and in so many ways they will be thinking and whatever they learn they listen they see they do not accept it properly first secondly because of the ego they cannot accept it and secondly they think that it will be of no use for them because the when we are talking about the god is talking about the spiritual people are talking about the spirit the god they don't always consider is it going to give us any benefit that is the and the benefit means the worldly benefit they don't find that they don't accept it so this is the reason even though the ramachandra himself came and in the ramayana wonderful way he is explaining and sri krishna came the excellent way he gave the whole thing that that is the first book that came in our hands bhagavad-gita there everything he has explained the whole psychology then the bhagavata his life so many great sages came now in the modern age bhagavan si rama krishna and here we find 1836 he was born and then he practiced just before everyone's eyes how to control our mind our passion and then to give our whole mind to god he when he came here seeing these people all around they are eager to listen to him they're eager to see him even then he's telling mother why have you brought me here they are hazed around and not free can i free them master masha srima is commenting did the master find the people assembled there were locked within the prison walls of the world did their helplessness make the master address these words to the divine mother the divine mother the mother means divine mother that is the power of god we will hear from sirama krishna afterwards now one person he lived in gaji poor that is now in bihar and there a famous saint was there powhari baba pau means the ear ahari the people is to think that he only lives on ear he eats only ear he don't think anything else so that the name was powhari baba he was a yogi swami vivekananda met him heard about him went over there met him and was thinking that he will learn some yogic technique from him then afterwards he found that pavari baba himself is asking the spiritual guidance from vivekananda then he said in what is the use of sitting over here so vivekananda was always a student he wanted to learn and now he understood that since i have come to see rama krishna he has blessed me i have got everything so this is the baba these people are talking about him and one gentleman said sir this gentleman visited pavari baba he lives in gazipur he is a holy man like yourself they are talking about this they are com they don't understand so they are comparing they are telling like yourself bahari baba and then they are they are telling sir pavari baba keeps your photograph in his room pavari baba keeps your photograph suramar krsna's photographs somehow the power of a god and he kept it long back i went to now one gentleman took me that is in rajasthan in the rajasthan in that desert there is a very famous saint the woman and she lived under the earth because it is very hot so naturally many people they live like that and there i went now it is a very big astra so many people are there there i found that lady ninda rajasthan in those days it was so remote how she could get the picture of suramar krishna the picture of sirama krishna she is to worship they are in that under that earth they are almost like a cave when you go down almost in these are in our in this places the basement as we call it similar with go and then you find only a small little room where she used to live there on a rack she kept sirama krishna's water and the babari baba also kept si ramakrishna's water but these people they could not understand the significance of that so they were mentioning the pavari baba keeps your photograph in his room they are thinking the ceramic will be happy but the reaction was totally different pointing to his body the master said with a smile just a pillow case the body has no value at all if you are keep thinking that only my picture no this is the only a pillow case but the knowledge that within this and the way the knowledge is expressed then only you are benefited otherwise not so many people they looked at sirama so many people came in contact with rama so many came in contact with krishna they came to kill him fight with him so many he was god himself now thousands they are meditating praying worshiping only to get a glimpse of his darshan sri krishna and there are so many people thousands of people when they are meeting them they could not understand him so siram krishna is pointing that this body this picture is only a pillow case but inside what is that do you know that he didn't give any importance to this then he continued but you should remember that the heart of the devotee is the abode of god look at it immediately first he is telling this body is just like a pillow case insignificant immediately he is telling but the heart of the devotee what you are thinking what you are pondering what you are meditating that is very important if within your heart you are thinking about god that is the abode of god then this body is important he dwells no doubt in all beings but he specially manifest himself in the heart of the devotee so how clearly he is mentioning when you look at the person okay within him there is the manifestation of god is there but it is not fully manifested and the person is not aware about it but the devotee is aware he is meditating the god within his heart and when one is meditating and slowly transforming himself as god then that person that's why we go and touch the feet of the holy people why it's not the body it's not the person the wearing a dress it's not the name but the purity the god that is within him manifested you should remember that the heart of the devotee is the abode of god then he said he who is called brahman by the gyanis is known as atman by the yogis now these people they are brahma brahma-samajis this samaj you know the history it was created by raja rama honda only to protect the hindus from the conversion of into christianity and he thought that as because the problem that the hindus could not answer how a god he is all pervading can be in the image so he denounced and not accepting the images of god form less worship and the pure vedanta gyana he introduced afterwards it became that same thing became the named as brahm brahm or samaj the as a the group of people they were following that way they used to pray there is to worship but the formless god similar thing we see in the northeastern part there also one vaisnava saint his name is also shankara but shankara deva he introduced krishna worship without the image so if you go to asham among the assamese they call you will find two types of people both are vaishnava one vaishnava they are worshipping krishna with image another group of bush nevers they worship only the book that is bhagavatam and their temple is called that nam ghar naam means krishna naam they will be only chanting the name of hare krishna krishna so naam gar it's not a mandir and in that temple they only keep that book like the shakes they only keep the book guru granth sahib and the grant the scripture sahib is a respect and he is the guru the grant as their scripture is the guru so guru granth sahib and similarly these people also they don't believe in the image of there are so many social other things are also there sirama krishna he is explaining this thing in a very simple way to these people because they are confused so many thousands of years researches went on and our issues they understood that without form ordinary people won't be able to think about god whenever you are asking them to be holy to practice religion if you ask them without any form you practice it is impossible for them so naturally what happened there buddhist religion they also buddha also told you need not to worship me what happened they went on creating all the buddha images everywhere the people cannot and the stupa no we are not keeping the buddha images but stupa stupa means again a form and there all these things are there so that is the reason the hindus they understood it and this is a research work they found that for the ordinary people images are very essential so bhagavan sirama krishna he is discussing that topic with these people because they think god has no form and he is only brahman sirama krishna the first sentence is telling he who is called brahman by the gyanis gyanis means those who are following the path of knowledge gyanis is known as atman by the yogis and in the hindus they developed four ways paths to reach god one is gayana then karma bhakti and dhyana yaan karma bhakti dhyan these are the four this yogi as we are reading studying that patanjal yoga darshan this yogis their ultimate goal is paramatma jivatma all this way and the ghanis they call brahman sirama krishna is telling the same brahmin is called priest when worshipping and the same brahmin when cooking he knows as cook the brahmin when cooking knows as cook and the brahmin when worshipping in the temple known as priest but he's a brahmin only so the different names are there but the same person and here this bhagavan is telling it is the unwavering conviction of the gyani that brahman alone is real and the world illusory all these names and forms are illusory like the dream and what is brahman it cannot be described one cannot even say what brahman is whether he is a person or not this is the opinion of the ghanis the followers of vedanta philosophy look at how sirama krishna only few words is explaining the gyana yoga this is very very difficult the gyana yoga because here they are telling about all that you see is illusory temporary is all changing and some of the people they are questioning why do you call it as a illusory because we can see it we can feel it we can touch it we can describe it so in every way it is there how can you say it is illusion illusion means is a dream like i am seeing that a snake over there but in reality it is a rope that's the illusion but how can you say this whole world is illusion so this is the question against the gyana yoga the gyana yoga they say no these are all illusions because it is changing but the bhaktas again it comes to bhaktas accept all states of consciousness there are when now at this moment we are conscious then there are dreams in dreams in sleep we are conscious but subconscious then there are super conscious in meditation in prayer we are in super conscious the consciousness is having three stages super conscious conscious subconscious and sometimes you are looking but your mind is not attached with your thought your mind is in different way in different place you are only looking someone is going on talking to you you can hear those sound but not the words you don't understand because you are not that way conscious the moment is mind is alert and connected with the ear then only whatever the words you are listening you are understanding thinking over that those words you are conscious the conscious and the subconscious we know but we don't have the idea about the super conscious so this is called bhaktas they are they are taking all states of consciousness as true they take the waking state to be real they don't think that the world is illusory like a dream they say that the universe is the manifestation of god's power and glory see this is the beauty of the hinduism the sanatana dharma there is no only one channel that whether you believe it or not understand it or not and you have to follow it you must follow it now there are different type of personalities different type of thoughts different type of ah their convictions in that way they are following the bhaktas they are following a different path how the thinking all that we see is the manifestation of the same god so it is a reality for them gyani just opposite so this way sirama is explaining then it says the devotee of god wants to eat sugar not to become sugar cerama krishna is telling that they want to eat sugar they like to enjoy the god has manifested himself in so many different ways and wherever i go sometimes of cruel people crooked people cunning people and good people friendly people divine people all their creation of the god and i am enjoying in all respect in everywhere in all company so they like to enjoy because they are sure that it is god's creation so different way one gentleman suramar krishna in kathmart is there mentioning he is also a monk he came to dakshinesha and there his prayer was totally different type very unique time early morning used to get up and go on clapping his hand dancing and singing the glory of god oh god you have created the sun you have created the air you have created the trees you have created the river you are so great you everywhere that i see you you are only you only so that was his prayer and there are other people in the same doctrination the same thing there at the same time they are sitting by the bank of the ganga closed eyes trying to withdraw all their senses from the outside meditating so they look in different way one is yogi one is bhakta and the gyani is like dota puri they are constantly discriminating this body this mind all the sense organs all these external things that we see is nothing it is only the brahman the consciousness that we must come to know we must know this is how god is telling then the yogi sees seeks to realize the paramatma the supreme soul yoga he his ideals is the union of the embodied soul and the supreme soul he withdraws his mind from the same subjects and tries to concentrate it on the paramatman now there are so many ways it is going and all are going to the same goal one is bhakta one is yoga one is ghani siram krishna right this moment is not explaining about the karma because karma the action in everything present the yogi also doing the karma of discrimination and withdrawing the gyani also doing the same karma and bhakta also doing the same karma so look at over here and some of the our devotees they will be changing the flower the clothings and decorating them god and offering him food as if he is leaving and then praying to oh god please come and eat food this way they are thinking all are living unless and until you consider that everything is leaving everything is divine you cannot be a bhakta in the temple when you are offering a just like doing that without believing that god is present there you are not a bhakta the first and foremost thing for a bhakta is to believe god is leaving so this is very important for a bhakta years together they are going on offering food to the temp in the temple and then praying to the god but god never replies but bhakta goes on doing it that is called a tremendous patience in bhakta yogi also sitting every moment his eyes goes and fall on something immediately the reaction is coming in his mind oh my god why that man is suffering oh my god why that man is creating problem oh see such such a nice flower this thing that thing all that is coming in his mind and he's withdrawing and throwing it out i don't like to see this i don't like to hear it i don't like to touch it there's also karma and lot of patience it goes on doing like that the razors age they call it the famous book the razor's age you have to work on that constantly every moment years together maybe at the time of your death also you have not realized anything no problem oh god next live again i will try to realize you so that is the tremendous mental strength ganny also doing a same way so the karma is present in everything so if sirama krishna is telling this and it's a wonderful way anumanji he expressed it he said deho buddhwa who is the embodiment of a devotee and he is telling this this way when i think that i am separate from you when i consider this deha this shadira this body is different i am your servant oh god you are the master i am your servant when i feel that i am also pure i am also utman but not full so i am a part of you o god but when the atma buddha when i feel that i am only that atman the pure self i am you i am he i am he this is the beauty of the hinduism but the problem again in hinduism when someone is practicing some part and criticizing others that is the problem not understanding the others not appreciating the others i love my this path no doubt no problem go ahead godspeed but do not criticize others that is what suramar krishna is trying to do lord sri krishna told this unity here in the bhagavad-gita also we find that in the fifth chapter yet prabhupada means the knowledge where the people through their knowledge reaching yoga those who are working or meditating we trying withdrawing their senses from the same objects they're also reaching the same goal kamcha yogamcha yeah those who have realized this they have realized long long back in bhagavad-gita krishna told we read bhagavad-gita almost in every houses in hindu houses there will be a bhagavad-gita when someone passes away die the hindu family they will be distributing the gita books to all the brahmanas and the brahmanas they take it and like that they will be collecting book and keep eating their shelf maybe to a 12 13 15 gita but never open it that is the problem if you are not reading and not trying to understand it is of no use what for the sastra only just as a book form it will be there no you have to read you have to understand then throw away you don't need the sastra you have to leave with those ideas that is the beauty and here it says see ramakrishna is telling but the reality is one and the same see the unity the speciality of bhagavan si ramakrishna is bringing the unity in diversity here intra-faith the muslim the christians and all these jews and buddhism all different religions they sit together discuss and they try to find out the unity at the same time among the hindus not only among the hindus in all faiths in the christianity also there are so many denominations in the islam also so many denominations do you sit together and think what are denominations someone explained the truth in his own way someone explained the truth in his own way and now some people liked that explanation followed him it became a denomination hear this dualism god is separate i am separate because i am the only servant i cannot become the master so some people they like this idea yes how can we be the god it became dwayta means to god and the devotee majority of the religion are practicing only this god is separate allah is separate bhagavan is separate so this way we go second comes vishishta advaitha here they say we are part and parcel of the same god but separated like the main fire and from that small small sparks same fire all the the qualities and the potentialities of the fire is there in the small spark separated from the main fire it's called vishista sri ramanuja of the south india he narrated this he explained the truth in this way so some people are following they are called vishishta advaitha and another people like shankaracharya said whatever you see is nothing but brahman manifestation of the god but only you see in a different way different manner so that is your problem but the truth is only one no two so ah means two or means negative so there is no two only one some people they follow like this and the problem is dwitin and advaitin they will be constantly fighting and trying to prove that they are the best and they are the correct bhagavan sri ramakrishna is telling reality is one and the same the difference is only in name he who is brahman is verily atman and again he is bhagavan bhagavan is for the devotee dweeting atman for the yogis and brahman the word brahman used by the gyanis so this is only difference he is the brahman to the followers of the path of knowledge paramatman to the path of yogis and bhagavan to the lovers of god so this way bhagavan si rama krishna is bringing an unity in intra faith the ghanis who adhere to the non-dualistic philosophy of vedanta say that creation preservation and destruction of this universe itself and all its living being are the manifestation of shakti i told you friends that if you have to develop a philosophy you have to explain three things first the creator second the creation third the relation between the creator and the creation these three answers if you can give convincingly that's a philosophy the shankaracharya and the gyanis they are telling that everything is nothing but the same brahman now the creation all this they are something is getting birthed then they're leaving for some time and then again it's dying so creation sustaining and the destruction how it is happening who is doing it if the brahman is inactive then to answer that question the ghanis are telling it is shakti so it is a gyanamarga the path of knowledge is explained by sirama krishna only in two lines only in two sentences he is telling non-dualistic philosophy in the vedanta veda there are three dwita bishi advaita but when it is said that only advaita non-dualistic it is not dualistic but qualified non-dualist it is only non-realist or call modest so this is advaitha philosophy it says how the creation is there preservation is there and the destruction is there how the brahman can do it because as because you are telling brahman is totally inactive it never works then the answer is the power of brahman and that is called shakti the divine power is creating preserving and destroying if you reason it out you will realize that all these are as illusory as a dream brahman alone is the reality and all else is unreal even this very shakti is unsubstantial like a dream here also bhagavan sirama is explaining the viewpoints of the advaita gyani he is telling they are correct that true if you go on reasoning you will see that even the shakti is also nothing the creation is also nothing so this is in one way does brahman and shakti are identical now he is bringing that knowledge to these people who is to hate goddess kali who never is to turn to the images of gods and goddesses and they used to denounce the god and goddesses and he is bringing that idea that knowledge to these people brahman and shakti are identical if you accept the one you must accept the other because these people this brahma the brahma-samajis they accepted brahman but not the shakti but we when you are accepting the brahman you must have to accept a shakti why otherwise you cannot answer how the creation is there sirama krishna never attended any school never read any philosophical books but he is talking to keshav chandrashin who was considered as the most intelligent and the knower of knowledge he used to explain vedanta and here sirama krishna is explaining vedanta to him and in such a simple language and here he is telling brahman and shakti if you are accepting one brahman you must have to accept the shakti otherwise how can you explain it is like fire and the power to burn if you are accepting the fire you must have to accept the power to burn if there is no power to burn then it is not fire so this way the excellent way very simple way sirama krishna is explained you cannot think of the fire without his power to burn nor can you think of the power to burn without fire you cannot conceive of the sun's rays without the sun nor can you conceive the sun without its rays what is milk like again is going on giving small small examples so the people can understand can remember when you are telling the philosophy people may not remember but when you are giving in through a example it is so very simple to understand so that's why the great teachers they will always be telling the philosophy immediately quoting some examples parables stories songs so the people can remember it so this is the beauty so in the they say the great masters a great entertainer when sudama krishna is to speak all people is to listen and there is no microphone so in the small room many people can't see him even so they will be trying to cram their neck to just to get a glimpse of this ramakrishna and he is explaining not a little sound print of silence and they are listening because so entertaining and when the people like us is explaining people look at constantly at the door shall i or shall i not so this is not the fault of the truth it is the fault of the people who are explaining so the great teachers are great entertainer but all entertainers are not great teachers there are great entertainers are there are not great teachers when they come when they talk they mesmerized and they will be singing dancing even just they will be delivering the lecture mesmerizing but they are not great teachers then we have to understand so this is the thing srirama krishna is explaining the primordial power is ever at play primordial power is the brahman shakti that is called kali she is creating preserving and destroying in play this power is called kali the majority of the people they are doubtful about the kali because of the image she is killing the people and keeping the heads and the human skulls as a girl and she is black she is with the the weather sword so the terrible the way durga is having ma durga is also having so many weapons but people are happy because she looks good this is a beautiful looking lady and it's okay but the goddess kali is not like that but those who are worshiping they say once you get a glam glimpse of the goddess kali so beautiful why because she is knowledge she is brahman and this was sirama krishna in those days when everybody was criticizing goddess kali he worshipped goddess kali and that too just so near to calcutta the theme capital of undivided india all great people used to live in calcutta and they used to go on criticizing they never criticized krishna this is okay some to some some of the incidents in the life of krishna they could not explain they could not understand so they criticized but majority krishna is okay god is durga and this is beautiful she's also killing but they say it's okay but goddess kali all the oh my god how this can be the lady is not wearing anything how we can think of this type of lady killing people as a mother as a divine mother sirama krishna is explaining that the shakthi shakti is power and now we will read up to that and you will wonder this primal power the power of the kali and it says that the shakti and the power it binds and all the time we are under that shakti all that power so that's why but though you reason all through your life unless you are established in samadhi you cannot go beyond the jurisdiction of shakti the people will be reasoning in so many ways but to go beyond the shakthi and what is that shakti when afterwards we'll be reading we will see that it has two very special power one is covering your the truth and then super imposing something else on the truth discovering the truth and then superimposing on that truth something else this is very peculiar when we look at the movies cinemas we forget that there is a white screen we always think that so many things are going on but on what what is the basis over which all these things are moving we forget that we think only those people and the places and all these things are going on and we become involved with that also when a person jumping from a bridge and falling in the deep river we feel oh my god what will happen to him and below the river also he is lying over there something has happened who is sending the picture there is a camera and the cameraman is also there so all people are there it is only cinema is a movie people are creating but when we see see on what there's a screen we forget the screen and that screen is true if the screen is not there there is nothing to be reflected there is no movie you can't see anything so that is why it says unless and until you go beyond that you are not and how can you go beyond that this is samadhi in every sunday we are studying the patanjal yoga darshan and this patanjal yoga darshan they explained in the last class only we were discussing this explaining so clearly what are the things that is binding us they say patanjal in 30 and 31st one after another there are nine then again in the 31st they say that is also you have to control your body is trembling how can you control your mind and you are constantly some feeling of pain is there misery is there melancholy is there you cannot meditate so you have to be always free and happy that is the thing when you are constantly you are thinking you are happy that is also a problem and you are thinking in a melancholy problem and some people will be constantly thinking that they're in problem so how they can meditate how to control my mind so these are the problems surama krishna is telling unless and until you are reaching to samadhi and what happens when we get the samadhi this narendra nath he was not vivekananda then a young man of 19 he was meditating and he was going on requesting suramar krishna give me the blessing so that i can get the idea of nirvikalpa samadhi there is no kalpa there is nothing to hold our mind constantly think on something holding something we hear something mind remembering that we see something mind ponder over there it goes away like that but here we doubt having anything any object to ponder over to think too old mind is straight just like the lamp is burning the flame is there and there is no air flow of air so just straight that the lamp is burning the flame of that fire and not even trembling that type of mind and then they give another example when you are pouring the oil from one pot to another there is not a single bubble inside that oil because there is no air so that type of mind so that is called samadhi and that young man he got samadhi that day they were meditating and suddenly narendranath found that he has no body he had the consciousness then he started shouting to all others they were sitting in meditation nearby they heard him shouting where is my hands where are my legs and where is my head where is my then all this way they were shouting and these people they thought he has died and as a ghost he is talking they ran to sirama krishna and told sir perhaps naren has died and he is talking like this then there is no a sign of life in his body then salaam krishna smiled and said for a long time he was festering let him be there in that mood for some time it will be all right so that way totally physical body consciousness go away is it possible and when it is possible that's called samadhi and then only we can understand that we are beyond the realm of kali it is one and the same reality when we think of it as inactive that is to say not engaged in the acts of creation preservation destruction then we call it as brahman but when it engages in these activities we call it kali the shiva and shakti the shiva is brahman and kali is brahman active shiva is brahman inactive and to make it easy for people to understand because we we can understand the male female father mother so a male god and a female so that way shiva and kali but they are not separate they are not male female they have that brahman that consciousness one inactive but all white all knowledge is there inactive and it is red black and white kali is mixed up of black red and white so that way it is active then it's not manifested totally then at the same time it has knowledge so that is the symbol of kali sirama krishna is telling that it is like the water called in different languages by different names such as jal pani aqua water and so forth in different languages the people they will be calling it in that way in bangladesh year i was traveling everything is written in bangla so i thought i will also speak in bangla and that heroes test came then i told in bengali sister can you please give me a glass of jawl then in bengali called jal that she told in that east bengal way the ki khan buzina what you are telling i can understand key con what you are telling business i cannot understand but i am speaking bengali then the next man who was sitting by my side he was laughing i told what happened whether you said joel i hear they say pani she understood it but don't give it because when you are telling the bengali she is expecting that you must speak properly so there they call it pani but pani is not a bengali word pani is a urdu word so it comes from that so anyway so this language are different but thing is same this is called sirama krishna is the incarnation of unity in diversity is not never telling that you have to change and become only one no you remain as it is only become good and perfect in your own path and then appreciate others also that's all in the name of religion so much of bloodshed because this ignorance the moment people will understand these everything will be then here sirama krishna is telling some addressed reality he is not telling god or anything he is telling some address the reality as allah some as god some as brahman some as kali look at it the names are different the thing is same but you go and try to tell them they will beat you they will kill you they will all the time thinking no you are not correct at all and they will be angry suppose i have not followed your path why you should be angry why you try to force me to follow your path and that is the ego when i am asking you to do we must have to do and that is the reason in many you know the medieval time we see one king who is a catholic converting the whole country all the people as catholic then if they are not the next queen or king comes as a protestant you immediately next night you have to be converted into protestant because i the king or the queen following this so you must have to follow he doesn't bother about what is god or not he doesn't listen to the words of jesus but as because i am a catholic you have to be catholic there's a the last valley there's a movie long back it was there oh my god if you see that you'll understand the father was catholic so he killed all people as maximum possible his own subjects because they were following the protestant so the catholic father next his own daughter became the ruler and she is a protestant she started killing the catholics how can you explain it is it religion madness sheer madness in the name of religion why do they think like that ego i am the ruler whatever i say you have to follow i am the priest whatever i say you have to follow because i know everything about god you cannot burn the lamp like that because i the priest is telling like this the god you have to see the god's face with the lamp god is giving the everything light and now we are burning a lamp to see the god it is just like burning a lamb to see the sun in the day time so this is the problem of the ego suramar krishna is telling about this allah the god the brahman and this kali then he said rama jesus dulga hari the personal gods and goddesses also the same now the kesha is asking sir please describe how many ways the kali the divine mother spokes in this world keshav is a leader in brahma-samaj was he interested to know about kali that's why again look at it again as because keshav became interested in kali a group of people separated from keshap they started another so denomination goes on increasing in this way then master said oh she plays in different ways it is she alone who is known as maha kali nikta kali shashan kali raksha kali shama kali there's so many names as because in the different way she is working then she sudama krishna is explaining moha kali and nita kali are mentioned in tantra philosophy when there were neither the creation not the sun the nor nor the moon nor the planets and the earth when darkness enveloped the darkness then the mother the formless one maha kali look at it the mother mohankali but formless no form she was known as mahakali without any form but it was all ignorance it was covered darkness enveloping darkness the beautiful way it has been explained the great power was one with maha kala kala the absolute kali and the kala then where that knowledge was resting the activity it is with the mahakala the sheba shamakali is somewhat tender aspect and is worshipped in the hindu households suramar krsna's many places he said if you have to worship goddess kali you should worship shama khali and then she at the surama krishna has worshipped this bhagavatarini that is in dakshini sharkali and he said if you like to keep the picture of kalya or the image of kali you keep this image or the picture when the mother is tender she is the dispenser of bones and the dispeller of fear and the right hand side he she is having this type of one hand like this another hand like this the boon and the dispenser the i am the mother why you are thinking about it come to me i will save you what you want i will give you so this is right hand side the left hand side is totally different right hand side is so good left hand side she's holding a shoulder and a shivered hate so that is that is bama kali dakshina kali bama kali sirama krishna is telling about this raksha kali the protectress in the time of epidemic femin earthquake drought and flood and shashankali is the embodiment of the power of destruction so that's why the ordinary people should not worship the shashana kali so here sirama krishna is explaining in the
