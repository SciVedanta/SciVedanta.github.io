[83: Panchama Veda 83: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBDZapJVzf4)

the gospel of sri ramakrishna which have given the name s Pancham aveda tabu khatam rhythm dr. G venom Kobe very little gal mashaba home cigana mangalam srimad additem booby goonan de barriga llena they'll say in Vedanta sobhan then ma Nana and third state needed the asana sabana mana nah and we did the asana these are the three steps in Vedanta to realize that gunmen what is thus rahbani yearly monona thinking over there pondering over there whatever we have hard over that we have to think Shabana Madonna and then comes needed the Arsenal and then meditate over that these are the three things master Marcia has given a wonderful description and he has recorded the conversation of bhagavan sri ramakrishna and at the same time giving the beautiful description so when we are studying when we are reading a deer we find sravana we are listening and at the same time master Masha is helping us to imagine that particular time and the particular moment when see Ramakrishna was giving this Salman dastak so that we can transport our mind we can take our mind over the and can imagine when you are closing our eyes listening to vagabond see Ramakrishna transporting our mind into that situation position and then we are going deep into that meditation meditation on what on the words of vagabond see Ramakrishna its meaning and how it can benefit me in my spiritual life so that is very very important those who are sincere in spiritual life or otherwise only curiosity is there curious they like to just read and know they like to know many other things as a general knowledge and similarly they like to know something about God something about spirituality okay that is the different thing those who are sincere seeker for them it is a total mind given to God we are reading and that's called the Veda why beta is the Guru Vader is the knowledge and the true beta the knowledge that comes to us slowly slowly make our mind in such a way that we disassociate with all the things that we are with we are in slowly with disassociated we are with them very much with them but not attached with those so that is the teaching raghavan see ramakrishna is giving here he was as we have already studied as we have already know he was in a group of among the Brahma devotees he went here and they assembled over there to chant over and to think over that so here we find that see ramakrishna is having the conversation with a Brahma devotees and when he said how can one realize God very pertinent question very important question those who are things here very interested to realize God for them this question is very very important and it is asking God himself I am asking the question how can I realize God to whom I am asking to God himself and the answer is very simple it says by directing your love to him and constantly reasoning that God alone is real and the world usury is all temporary this is the answer now sometimes some people didn't like it the moment we talk about the in permanency of the world we don't like it but liking disliking doesn't matter that is the truth things are going to go whether you like it or not so if we look at our life when we were born in a family how what was the situation and then all those who were so close to us what happened to them automatically they they have gun brothers sisters our relatives they're all engaged independent then we are going and we are getting connected with some other people other environment and we are not understanding that actually we are becoming alone lonely travelling lonely and some people coming in our life few days they are living with us and then again they are going to their own directions this way the whole life is going and more we are attached to that more you are thinking about that the more we are bound by that a more suffering more life more birth rebirth going on so Hinduism teachers so this is temporary whether you like it not this is the truth now if you can understand these and as quickly as possible you understand it you try to go beyond it and that is collision lava etc when he asked how one how can one realize God is not that you have to accept Hinduism or Christianity or Buddhism are doing all there are only schools nothing else we go and enroll our selves in thats particular school school of thought but the main thing to realize god that is important directing your love to him the love means the whole heart all feelings directing love to him and then constantly reasoning that God alone is real and the world illusory why the reasoning why constantly thinking in that way so regularly preparing myself so that I am NOT attached I am in that I am NOT leaving the samsara I am performing all my duties but I am NOT attached to it then the brown Nativity is asking another question and that is very very interesting most of the people there talking that way we have passions like anger and last what shall we do with these now I cannot simply say where I am free from anger no I have desires and when those desires are not fulfilled angered why anger comes unfulfilled desires so desires are there and I cannot simply say in a fine morning I will say oh all i am giving away all desires you may say may repeat you may write but these hats are there it is always there in lurking in the heart sometimes expressed sometimes not is there and as long as desire is there I cannot totally give my love to God because I have some other things also to take care so what to do here see Rama Krishna is giving the very practical suggestions died it the six passions to God passions are six types so he is telling the impulse of last should be turned into the desire to have love with Earthman the tremendous desire is lost and if we have turning that desire to God as mera I could lead and all the successful people in the spiritual world the deed that is called turning that passion towards God and I love god I must have him I must see him I must talk to him I must feed him so that is the tremendous force going towards God and second feel angry at those who stand in your way to God if anybody is coming and standing on my way I am so angry there are so many incidents I can remember one long back in Calcutta one young lady very young in the school level only class 10 11 like that and she'll fell in love with her teacher the teacher is to come to teacher in at home and the private tutor and the tutor was almost double the age a married person having the children everything but this girl was having a little property not very rich but some may be that the and he was thinking to get that those things so this way you know what happened that young girl killed his grandfather grandmother father and mother this for persons only for that dad loved she wanted to achieve that person and he gave the idea that when they are taking food mix this type of medicine and they will be unconscious then do like these do like that with the electrical to where everything all details that gentleman told and this girl did why father mother grandpa grandma wow how come that girl forgot let's go lost a tremendous force in the mind and that forgets everything and never hesitate to kill even those so close and that is that strength so that's why see ramakrishna stealing if you can turn that towards god and if you think they know i am going to realize God anyone talking I am coming and trying to drag me out of that anger on that feel greedy for him how come the sri caitanya mahaprabhu he realized God Shankar Acharya realized God Jesus Christ realized God but the realized God why I should not that type of the greedy greed if you must have to feel of eye and mind then associated with God and the ego I cannot give up my ego III that consciousness is constantly there so feel I belong to God the God is mine I and mine that should be turning to God say for instance my rom my Krishna my god God if you must have pride then feel like divisional who said I have touched the feet of Rama with my head I will not bow this head before anyone else so that is the pride homme Cara and all the six type of passions and all the six passions we need turning towards the God you realize God so wonderful way of teaching for whom for only Hindus for Muslims for Christians for whom for each and in everyone those who are desirous to realize God so that is the wonderful discussion it always turned us two words that now these passions are very very strong as i was giving an example a very tremendous terrible example and if the passion goes towards the worldly things what happened as they happened to that girl and the hard master teacher both of them were in prison and they could not satisfy their desires and they ultimately passed their days and maybe they were hanged or something like that happened so this way we are actually when our all passions are directed towards the worldly things the result comes that is terrible but those passions when directed towards God result is beautiful very full of happiness and respect unselfishness is more paying but we don't have the patience to practice it swami ji said Shami Vivekananda unselfishness what is that unselfishness me and mine that is selfishness just opposite dau and dying everything is towards God everything is God so that way when everything is directed towards God there anyone coming to the god I am so happy and I feel that friendliness oh they are coming to God the good people that friendliness that love and we become friends and like relatives so that is the beauty of so you are expanding expanding with joy and when people look at you look at this man totally dedicated to God whenever you are approaching him he is so kind and so and that is one thing I must tell you the moment the one goes to a religious person thinks that it will be kind Everett moment so practicality you have to see it is not possible to be all the time courteous and gentle when I see that you are making a mistake it is also the duty of the holy man to make that person rectified corrected so that is also essential so mind has to be kept open I am going over there forward to learn now you have to forget your position your age and then only as a humble person when you are going then only you can receive otherwise not so they say depicted the picture of Shankar Acharya sometimes the Guru sometimes the preceptor sometimes the holy man may be young than me but that doesn't matter it is the knowledge it is the experience is the realization that counts so that is also see Ramakrishna is telling so this is this all the fashions all the desires should be directed towards God then another devotee is asking very interesting question he is telling most of the people they in everywhere wherever you go in the question answer this is the question you always faced if it is God that makes me do everything then I am NOT responsible for my scenes if it is God that makes me do everything in the bed antha it says and also the devotee they believe that we doubt the will of God you cannot even blink sri ramakrishna gave an example without the wish of god even add Riley will not fall that much everything predestined the EBT so the argument is then whatever I am doing it is predestined he is asking me to do so how come I am has seen committing seen Sosa Ramakrishna smiling after listening this question hearing this question he is smiling and he is immediately the answer is yes do you Donna also said that you know the Duryodhana story in Mahabharata he was a villain and he also said that what they are rishika sure this the dana lethani duped o'schmidt ithaca romy you the God you claim yourself God isn't it Krishna you are the rishikesh g/km is one who is inside and controls all my senses in if you are directing me you die within me and if you are asking me to do and I am doing so what is the scene i am against you i am it is the Pandava i am telling people cheating people because of you and why then you have living at they're punishing me arguing with me and angry with me it is you only isn't it that is Durga Donna's argument see Ramakrishna to give this answer somewhere else he is telling a story and that story he goes like this a person he was a very good gardener and he developed a beautiful garden we were is to come into that garden is to praise oh my god the beautiful flower the beautiful trees and he's to Phil Brown I have done this I have done this the last year I brought this plant and I have done this I have to every time i i i i it is alright then suddenly one call somebody came and perhaps cow was also appreciating my eating and the cow was eating those with plants and flowers and these person became so angry he went and killed that cow now Hindus believe that if you are killing a cow the scene is committed so obviously go what they are Papa as they call it the sin committed by killing a cow it came to the brahmana is a story and told that I am entering into it you because you have committed this scene then here you wait wait wait wait i have to tell you one thing you are a you are the scene that trying to enter it in me but do you know i did nothing because in the scripture it is written it is the indra the God the God are the Lord of God God's in Indra that controls the senses and this my hands and my mind and all those things are controlling the now Indra gave me the anger Indra brought that stuff and then Indra raise the hands my hands and beat that cow and killed it how I am to blame you go to Indra he is the main sinner they in the scene he was confused it is true in the scripture it says all our senses are controlled by Indra then he went to the Indra in turtle is it that's true I control all the senses okay but wait a little I let me talk to that man then the inner came in the disguise of a another gentle man and he entered into the garden from the other other direction and him started praising oh it was just like the garden of the Indra is a haven even is not so beautiful who made it then the brahmana heart he came running and told it is me said I did it it's all my planning all my all my all my Indra was going on praising praising praising and approaching towards the place where the cow was lying dead he went on my god who killed the cow then that man was taken our he was not expecting this question and he was so much engrossed in praising himself so he forgot that he should not take this gentleman to that corner now he was standing quiet and inter-assay all the good things you and batting Indra know it is you again so let the scene entered into you so see ramakrishna stealing gujju Donna said that TRAI rishikesh arista Tina you oh my god who is sitting within my heart and you were directing me to do whatever I am doing but that won't do and he says if a man has the form conviction that God alone is the doer and he is his instrument then he cannot do anything sinful look at it if a person is totally dedicated to God and hundred-person he says I do nothing whatever the God is directing me to do I do assalamu Krishna himself he never did anything himself every time used to go to the goddess Kali and whatever she told used to do for us of course we never could understand that one person came and he told by seeing you I can understand you were a very good student of Vedanta I like to teach you with anthem and then I like to give you son Yassa immediately jungle wait let me go and talk to my mother this man was from the northern part of India from Punjab and he was doing all these big all his people are all the time talking about mother okay let him go go go go quickly and can get the permission and come back I am waiting for you but ceramic is new in to whom went to goddess goddess Kali in the Tanisha temple and conversing with the mother mother that meant told that you have the I should take sannyasa and I am capable to take sannyas is it true shall I take then he was very happy mother gave the permission nobody could understand the conversation and then he came with full confidence yes mother told she has brought you here to give me this initiation of Ronnie otra give me tell me he was wondering and afterwards the moment he said the mantra sannyasa mantra immediately he went into the trans into Samadhi and SAT like a stone for three days and nights those who have read this wonderful stories in the life and that is true that the room is still there where this thing happened that tree is still there the Ganges the river is still there is not a cock-and-bull story this is the history and when you went over there he said then that person he was thinking to get this type of deep tuition I it took 40 years in my life and this man SAT and went into Samadhi in a just in a flash not coming down then he started shouting to bring his mind down after three days and nights he came down so when he totally dedicated to God God is doing everything everything when who you had young we became the monastic member in the ramakrishna mission and the ramakrishna mission is an unique monastic organization and the ask the monastics to go and run a school or a college or a relief work to go into different difficult places so naturally as a monastic we are supposed to be away from those household things but they asked us to go and we were very young that time then one of our praying brother he asks didn't President choix me geesh Aramis Ramirez sure on the G and he said sharmaji you people are asking us to go into those places which we have left and we don't like to go there and suppose you are asking us to go in as an organization we are supposed to obey we go and something wrong happens in our life what will happen if we fall naturally some the vowels that we have taken as a sannyasi if it breaks then what will happen with great confidence the Swami told it can never happen if you are going with that idea and confidence and the faith that i am going to perform God's work if you even go to hell nothing is going to turn this you know bad nothing wrong can happen to you but the moment you think that I am doing that ego comes within you I cannot say anything that is up to you that is up to you because the ego means I you are then that time you were not attached with God you are not doing God's work you are doing your work and he gives the example see ramakrishna gives the example when the father is holding the hand of the child there is no chance for the child to fall but if the child is holding the hand the ego works I am holding the hand of my father sometime he may leave the hand of the Father and sometime he may try to do of his own and can meet accident may suffer the father is not responsible for that because you have left the Father's hand but when the father is holding he will never allow you even if you are asleep the father will go on taking care of you so that is the reason we have to those who are willing to get the blessings of God desires to see God and how to see God this is these are the examples and very very simple it says you know in the scripture it says that there are in the human life there are three types of action but the result three times three types means sometimes some people they'll be complaining that man is committing so many bad things but still there is no problem for him he's respected in the society he is living a very good life in the society then when you people say about the morality and constantly tell us to do some good thing thinking good why that man is not doing but he is enjoying his life but we do not know the result is accumulating each and every action has is equal and opposite reaction oh it will be if you have done something good good will happen to you something bad bad will happen to you so sometimes when you as suffering know it for sure in some life somewhere we did something wrong so this is and that time we need the purusha cara the self for self confidence and self afford to go beyond that and that time if we break we suffer more the results are three types and this is the speciality of the Hinduism today one young lady came in this year she is going to join her college I studied and she is associated between some group and she teaches the younger group Hinduism so I was jokingly asking him are what is Hinduism and these and these are like that the she knows many thing but in reason is a vast subject natural is difficult the karma theory is a very special theory among the Hindus the moment the karma theory is there the naturally reincarnation also comes on the process what is the reincarnation I have done something in this life but the result good or bad whatever but the result has not come to me in this life but it is going to be fulfilled in this next life sure that is why Xiaomi be vague on the side good good bad bad result non can skip the law no one can skip the law but there are another two three things at the air so here it says three types of result one is Sangeeth the sanskrit word is sanchit in stock and that is not that has not been opened we do not know what is there it is there may be some good bad but the stork is not open sangeeth in the stock agami is ready to give fruit agami means is ready like an arrow has already been fixed in the bow but still the person is holding it it has not been shot so the holding the arrow like that it is ready to beer fruits that is called agami and then comes are up there yup Rob dia Arab Thea already armed this are up there that is exactly what is happening in our life now so this are up there anything that is happening in our life now there's all the past karma that we did and that is already giving the proves that that is called productive or are up there that these are the three and it says naive our abdomen achetez Vedanta's are it says neighbor our abdomen ashati you cannot stopped are up here it has already started bearing fruit you can never stop it not even the realized soul those who have already realized God if something was there waiting for to make him suffer he will suffer that no one can stop but the two other things which was not yet started giving the fruits that can be nullified and that which was there in our stock not open that can be nullified that can be erased after realizing God so that is the way they say and in the bush Easter when he was talking with Sri Ramachandra my sister was the guru of ramachandra they used to be there and the barista also told you see llama auto ebah at areva means there is a many other arguments are there and the conclusion it says davido barsana Bowie her sugars chebe achievers cha toe one is good and another is bad two different types of desires at their results are also two different type when his good resultant of his bed result now ultimately but she stays telling giving the conclusion to see Rama utter Eva he hey rama rama therefore shreya prop no tisha chatham to achieve the highest goal chatham eternal shreya the best thing if you like to get that then so young jet nappanee Tina swim yourself must strike that is called purusha car when the person was asking the question to see Ramakrishna if God is doing everything then I am not committing any scene we are why because we have the ego and I am doing I am the door this conception in the mind so the result is also mine when the result is mine how can i remove that how can you stop that day in the bush Easter in yoga vasistha ubu Khurana momax Ubach arena it says very clearly you have to try so I am yourself yet napanee dana by striving by trying very hard pusheen even on yata by yourself effort and there is no other path there is no other part no one can save you so you have to try very hard and what is that try by listening the Holy Word sadhu sanga you have to go and have the company of the Holy what is the company of the Holy there's the all these words thats ramakrishna is telling when we are reading the gospel of ceramic ISNA that is a company of ceramic ich nur when you were reading the bible there is a company of Jesus so that way we have to understand these are the words of gods and I must have to understand these and it says in this way see Ramakrishna looked at the devotee is assembled in the worship Hall and said now all people now gathered over there so see Ramakrishna now turned to them and he saw these people and he commented as a very very important it says it is very good together in this way now and then some people they are trying individually in their homes in their private shrines nothing wrong it is good but when you come in the assembly when many people have assembled and all of them are singing raising the name of God meditating together and listening to the wonderful words so that gives more benefit than individually for when a person in the individual avoir trying to meditate and most of the time nitra that is one of the hindrance that that is the sleep the slumber and slowly the moment the mind is quiet you are trying to be draw the mind from the work different type of thoughts you are removing the mind becomes quiet instead of thinking God it goes into slumber it goes into sleep so that is one of the very very heinous we can say ficult problem in meditation so that it says Salam o Krishna sage is baited to be together when together even if I feel sleepy I cannot do that even if I feel Restless I cannot get up because some other people's presents are there their mayor presence making me concentrated the mayor presence of all other people around me helping me to concentrate if I am trying to whisper immediately somebody you look at me I'm alert and not supposed to be spur sitting over here and the nowadays the telephone mobile phone that they will be announcement will be there please stop it so naturally I'm alert so all these gathering together then we develop friendship among same type of mentality those who are going to the Hindu temples they have a different type of mentality those who are going to one me and then with some are going to one husband the gentleman comes and he said my wife is very interested to go to the Hindu temple they do some voluntary job over there many people are coming you please go this way you please go that way that is also you know the tremendous activity and then solving food cooking for thinking about marketing I am doing something there's nothing wrong is very good but if you are not thinking that I am doing it for God then it is a gain the bondage then you will have a fight with those people and they will come and say why you are doing like this now yeah this is my prerogative I must do like this then there is it all things happen in the society there is very common which very natural and ultimate result spiritual result is 0 I have spent my time and I am over there so that is why beach are why I am in the temple that must be there constantly in the mind asking myself and then whatever is happening there whatever best I can do to help British efficient and more than that no end up in church I must listen to him when the person is there someone is there in church whatever he says it's okay for me if I don't like stop coming but after going over there if you are fighting if you are agitated if you are making a group that is very bad ceramic ISNA is giving this way it is very good together in this way now and then and think of God and sing his name and glories whenever we meet over here in some occasions some Pujols one of the Xiaomi G's is doing the puja but I always try to involve all the devotees so that they they are also participating in the song or in the chanting so that their mind is also repeating those words understanding the meaning of all those getting concentrated and the moment you concentrate your mind is purified and the benefit of your visiting a temple is achieved so that is the main thing if you are not getting the benefit salam o Krishna said and then afterwards Master Masha is drawing a wonderful picture of the society it was I everywhere it is almost the same must see Ramakrishna he was in that gathering is a big gathering and then after that prasada that is the normal system in the Hindus and when the prasada the call was not coming because the socializing hey we're from you have com I have not seen you so natural in the wind the gathering it goes on after all that things were happening like that I went to speak in a durga puja pandal and then I noticed nobody is ready to listen to me and there is no chair even for me to see it and when they gave me they want chair and then they I was sitting over there I was all right then they asked me to go inside and to see see some that are cool picture Durga exit etc after that after 10 minutes when I came back the chair was of a bite somebody said I el sol a city so I was wondering where to go what to do but anyway one or two persons were there they understood immediately brought another chair they asked me to see near to that the the image and I found in there that very moment there is no Pooja was going on so all of them in groups they are coming young people they're coming and keeping the hand on the head of the lion taking snaps sometimes selfies it is Durga Puja and you are supposed to give respect to that image and because the images already I don't know but maybe there you are supposed to put the prana that means is the leaving God is over there and we are worshipping and these people without knowing anything without who will say what in America is a free country so you can do the puja I can take the selfie no problem so the young people going inside and someone is putting hand on the lion and giving and show and then taking the picture someone is putting inside the hand inside the mouth and someone is taking the pose of the shura going on so I was enjoying this also joy this also love and the joy comes from God but only thing if we can understand through these image we are actually remembering a real God bus everything is done only that much the image that I am looking is not ordinary is the God's image and this moment God is coming before me through this that is alright so that's why dear then they gave me the microphone whether you like it or not microphone is such a thing that sound is reaching everywhere so obviously I took that opportunity to tell that when you come before god is good god after seeing all the lion and the surah and these and there look at the eyes of the mother imagine the mother is looking at you and when I was telling like that the people slowly slowly they became calm and they came and they were trying to do that so that way sadhu sanga because they don't know the moment they learn immediately things change what is changing mind thinking and along it that behavior and the moment that changing immediately whole attitude gets purified and the blessings and the benefit of visiting or performing a puja is received obviously received the effort is only to direct the mind that's all how can we buy hearing by listening by learning what the best words so here see Ramakrishna he was talking with one or two people who were there most of the people they were engaged now the picture is they are very much engaged and the how that person who was organizing the sometimes I also go to different perler stock that some devotees the invite I go over there they invite their relatives neighbors and then I chat with them talk with them give something about talk about something about religion after that socializing and naturally that is good it they will be mixing it is mixing and they forgot the presence of Serrano Krishna and this is in Calcutta and ceramic Asia has to go back to Dutch nature and in those days you have to hire only the horse-drawn carriage and that to ordinary people there is to hire the cheap rate carriages drawn by old horses not very comfortable journey the cinema Krishna was thinking what will happen because it is night nine o'clock is a very late night even because from Calcutta to the sure they will go in that and there is no light on the roads like this so he was worried and he was telling to his companions some of them they were sitting near him his own devotee master Masha is drawing the picture what she was over most of the devotees wind down stairs or to the courtier for fresh air wailing while the refreshments were being made ready it was about nine o'clock in the evening the hosts were so engrossed with the other invited guests that they forgot to be any attention to sri ramakrishna the God Himself what they were doing they were praying to whom they were praying to God and now the God Himself is present over there in person and they were not having that capacity to understand so that is the main when after the war almost over and the wish ma he was lying on the bed of arrow because the arjuna put so many arrows in his body that he was lying on there but he was not touching the floor he was not the he was lying on the arrow jajaja and Arjuna waiting to pay because Bhishma had that capacity to die at his will so he was observing what is going on Oh Gina went there Krishna was there and Arjuna notice that the Bhishma is crying tears rolling down from his eyes he was wondering kshatriya wheel he is there the very in a hero in the world he's crying he's afraid to die how is it he asked her to Krishna why the grandpa he's crying he is afraid to die then the Krishna new Krishna to go and ask him were you asking me I am not crying he is can I can ask him Arjun event but this is I'm adding a Krishna didn't say that Krishna only told this is only told go and ask him and when the cold una went over there and asked if you know the answer he said I cannot understand the will of god god is doing everything the moment he and wants to do anything he could he can but while he is with you you people are suffering how it is it's very very difficult to understand how the gods God is working his ways of working system of working I cannot understand so I am wondering that is the way am so this is the God also going over there God Himself going over there sitting with them talking with them but he is not changing the minds look at it is only waiting because that you have to do what God is doing over there is his presence he is only telling the truth the secrets to realize God how one can realize God turning your mind towards God he said and do these and do that and do that he said but didn't force to for others to do he's waiting as per their condition they will move so that it he is working over there now now and then he is telling how come that they are not inviting they have already invited Albert not calling for the food i'm hungry and his not only nine o'clock when I will go one young boy was with him Hugh's to be with him and he became the first president of the ramakrishna mission afterwards very high spiritual soul that is his name was Roger so it becomes Raja mahadji's that rock hall was his men named and afterwards given people is to call him at raja the king then ID all this broom han and the ji maharaj he was a young man of 16 17 years he was a son of a landlord so naturally he was having there either young people and he was telling angrily rock hall angrily said let us leave here and go to the kitchen the master with a smile because the young boy naturally they behave like this he said keep quiet the carriage hire is three rupees and to ana's who will pay these the Ramakrishna the god because when a holy man is invited you are supposed to be otherwise that your you are inviting the holy man that is not complete you have to pay for his up and down then you have to give him some gift you then the complete it will complete Sosa Ramakrishna's so compassionate there is no limit to the Masters kindness see mom the master Marsha the teacher kaizen mentioning there is no limit to the Masters kindness the host where mayor youngsters how could he be displeased with them even though they did not show him proper respect further it would have been and in auspicious for the household if a holy man had left the place without taking food that's why wherever the holy man they go at least if they can't eat anything they will seep a little water they will drink little water and then the pray to God so all the blessings be on them so that is the tradition that is the system and master Masha is just this portion i will read how they were behavior behaving so the society people the fur gate after a long time dinner was announced the devotees were asked to take their seats the master with Raquel and others followed the crowd to the second floor just like an ordinary say they all went no room could be found for him inside the hall finally with great difficulty a place was found for him in a dusty corner can you imagine the Brahmin oh man subs some curry but see Ramakrishna could not eat it he ate Lucci with salt and took some sweets and then master much exciting there is no limit to masters kindness and from next again we will see how see Ramakrishna he is visiting different houses and meeting devotees inspiring them to come and gather over there and as the tradition wherever he used to go these to sing bhajans and mainly at that time there were two major groups even now also particularly in Bengal one is by Schnabel another is shocked shocked amines those who worship Kali another group is those who worship Krishna and there were a group of people whose to sing all this guilt honor Christina depicting describing the life of Krishna and how see ramakrishna reacting to those now let us conclude by offering our pranaam to him niranjana medium anantara bum bobtown compa Drita Bikram ye ye chaahat arum para Misha medium-term ramakrishnan she Rosanna mama you oh shanthi shanthi shanthi hurry he owned that said three tama Krishna hiragana must do
