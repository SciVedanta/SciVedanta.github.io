[292. Panchama Veda 292 - “Have Faith. Depend On God.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z46NtGQnIFU)

dear devotees and friends today wednesday evening we'll be reading and discussing from the gospel of sri ramakrishna the panchama veda let us begin sri madatam friends today is equal the day and night everywhere and then those places like chicago the now the summer is this the last day of the summer and slowly slowly the winter will approach now this is the life goes on like this constantly changing but still we survive and and this is the way we adjust ourselves the similarly the mind it also gets associated with the adjustment means it's the mind and the mind it adopts different type of things with which it is associated sangath sanjayati when it is associated with something we try to adopt that that is the reason all the time the teachers the guardians the mother father they always try to guide the younger people uh that you should not have the bad company in english as they say a man is known by his company so bad company what are the bad companies they're always thinking about something wrong so that is bad company so this we should have to understand in the spiritual life also those who were very much engrossed in the worldly things the things associated with the body and also the physical comfort and all that is better to avoid those who are sincere to develop the spiritual life for them and particularly those who wants to become completely dedicated for the monastic life or the spiritual life or the god realization for them it is a must the bhagavatam krishna like a very careful father like a mother he is taking care of those young minds young people who has the potentiality to become monks so he was taking care of the narendra not he was inquiring about him where he goes with whom he talk and what type of discussion all these things and when he heard that he goes to girish chandra ghosh you are all know about the giri she slowly slowly he was changing when he came in contact with suramar krishna but he was deeply associated with the worldly things so obviously srama krishna was guiding the young people like narendra and others not to get so close to girish why in the beginning if they go over there because of the association that type of influences so he was trying to protect them as a sapling is slowly becoming a tree it needs the fencing and when the fences are there uh obviously it will be protected and when it grows become a tree there is no problem even elephant elephant cannot do anything so this is the way it goes as ramakrishna was inquiring and we were reading from the page 716 the gospel of krishna the chapter the master and the narendra now after inquiring from on gentleman about narendra he became very satisfied now he's talking with the baburama the another young boy who will become a monk and his name will be the very famous in the ramakrishna order shami premananda he was a very pure soul he was not having any association with the worldly things the cerama krishna is to appreciate him a lot he is telling where are your books aren't you attending to your studies the he was actually attending the school naturally the surama krishna wanted that he should bring the book but at the same time he was telling he wants to stick to both to master because he was the headmaster the teacher so naturally suramar krishna was telling see look at your student that he wants to keep the both then what is the both god and also the worldly life he was not very elderly very young brother but even then sudama krishna was careful if you are having tremendous association with this or as or the hankering for the worldly things the name fame then naturally that mind cannot come to god there's nothing wrong is only the qualities to become a monk you need these qualities so he wanted to see that boy and he saw that he has the potentiality to become a monastic a monk so he was taking care and he told he wants to stick to both that is very difficult what will you gain by knowing god partially some idea about the god majority of the people who have the some idea about the god no they are also very faithful to god and they'll be praying that is a different life but for those who wants to become completely hundred percent dedicated for the spiritual life there is no two there is only one i and my god and nothing else so no partial the hundred percent dedication so that suramar krishna was mentioning go beyond both knowledge and ignorance that is the highest thing knowledge and ignorance ignorance of course so we are accepting these worldly things as permanent that is ignorance we are thinking this world with all these multiple cities so many varieties of things these are all permanent and try to get joy happiness from these temporary things obviously we fail all the time and every time we try to get joy the happiness and we always go for the permanent thing because that is in our nature and we don't get that then for few days we are unhappy again we try for something else but the same way and the same result so this we have to understand and the knowledge knowledge about the existence of god there is someone who is beyond all this who is the creator that is the knowledge but that knowledge also is not the complete about the god so you have to merge with god the knowing about a thing or possessing or imbibing that is a completely different thing so sirama krishna is telling ignorance and the knowledge both you should take use and go beyond that to remove the ignorance take the help of the knowledge and when you come to that go beyond that and become the being and becoming that's the swami vivekananda say so now he's talking with the babura and he was telling that you have to go beyond baburam the smiling is telling that's what i want master smiling but my child can you attain it by holding to both if you want that then come away baburama smiling take me away from the world so the baburama was asking sirama krishna because he had the faith the sudama krishna was having divine power so please bring me from there then i like to come to you the sudama krishna to masturbate rakha lived with me but that was different his father agreed to it if these boys stay here there will be trouble the salama krishna was so practical now the rakhal that means he was mentioning about another monastic afterwards he became the very famous swami brahmananda but he took the permission of his father came and stayed but now these if this young boys the below 15 16 if they are coming and staying with sirama krishna practicing meditation and preparing themselves to become hmong then their family may not accept it so that is the reason sudama krishna told then they will complain to the temple authority where sadam krishna lived and there will be lot of other problems see he wanted to avoid that out of his own if he is coming and it's okay he was supporting and sudama krishna was not having any asthma he himself was leaving in the temple the complex he used to get the food from the other supports if these boys are coming and joining and staying the extra expenditure so who will be at that so sirama krishna was waiting he told that you have no strength of mind you haven't much courage just see how the younger naren says i will come away for good so he was encouraging this boy but you have to do it yourself in the monastic life if somebody is inspiring you or somehow influencing you forcing you to become a monk that cannot be the as a good result it should be one should be from his own i like to be a monk so that should be hundred percent from his own that is srama krishna was inspiring him and then he was making fun i have been seeking one who has totally renounced lost and gold when i find a young man i think that perhaps he will live with me but everyone raises some objection and or other he was telling that it is very difficult you know the monastic life to lead a monastic sometimes we go to a holy people holy place live over there serve the place on the person and then we go back that is normal but completely dedication and the moment you join and you think within few days i will realize god that's not going to happen it's a lifelong commitment and the same routine you have to continue whether you realize god or not it doesn't matter once i have renounced the world and i know that is temporary i know that is not going to give me the permanent joy so i am not going back to that whatever it may happen so that type of commitment oh i'll be here for some time and then if it is not good i'll go somewhere else that is a different type of mentality but the commitment to the monastic life completely different that's the ramakrishna is mentioning over here then he's he was telling to see why has god made me lead this kind of life this kind of life means the sudama krishna was suffering for a monastic life this type of life means monastic life apparently he was married he was married to ma sharadamani devi but their marriage was completely different they never ever lived as the ordinary husband and wife they leave no never it was completely different people will never be able to imagine that divine relationship before the marriage those who know the biography of sudama krishna you know that sudama krishna himself pointed out go over there because this shakti the god and his power that it comes together it's not separate again and against krishna giving the example and vedanta also accept that it is the it's like burning capacity of the fire fire and its burning capacity can it separate it that burning capacity is fire the shiva and shakti the what is the shiva that knowledge and shakti with the help of that knowledge that power that is working so knowledge is transforming into action will be both the same so ma sharadamani they be apparently a mother form but at the same time it is the same it's no different but that is completely if you don't have the purity of heart you won't never understand so that is completely different he was a monastic why monastic means no association with the world and we know sriram krishna never could say even i he was not having that ego even so he's telling why god made me lead this kind of life then he's giving an unique the idea and he said caitanya became a sannyasi so that all would salute him whoever salutes an incarnation even once obtain liberation so this is the unique statement what is this incarnation that we find that the conception of the incarnation particularly in hinduism it started after the bhagavata when sri krishna the lord krishna he as an incarnation he played his role to establish the religion and again and again in the bhagavad-gita and many other places he said that i have calmed down though i don't have any business over here i am not having any desire but even then i incarnate in the fourth chapter sixth verse of the bhagavad-gita which very clearly says ajupi sannaba atma bhutan before that before sri krishna it was not accepted that's why in the bhagavata we find after the ninth uh chapter that says from the 10th the whole 10th chapter is dedicated to sri krishna there it mentioned a few lines about the sri rama he also is the same avatar but the rama avathara his activity was little different sri krishna and that's why some people they say krsna's not an incarnation it's the god himself but anyway to this conception of the avatar what is this about that supreme lord and through his power the power of which is known as maya is as if taking the human form as if not in reality ajobi sannabai atma is the eternal soul and is never born aja api the moment it is born as we are so obviously there is an end any creation obviously has an end anything that is born is going to die and avotada is not like that is the god himself is that supreme being through his power taking a form at different time in different places it is up to him we cannot doubt it because the it is all powerful so ajo atma bhutan he has is these universe the buddha the pranis the souls that is his creation he is the master prakritim swama dhishtaya prakri means its power is utilizing that power and manifesting as an abut then he said that i calm the god come now bhagavan sonam krishna mentioning over here if an incarnation that is the avatar the god incarnated if someone is paying respect to him out of devotion out of love then he's liberated why the blessings of god a compassion of god sufficient who has created us the being god now if the god is gracious on me what will happen no bondage what is that bondage deserve for the worldly life and which comes through the ego just by the grace of god by glance that will be gone and then you are completely free so like that only so this is the way it thinks goes it depends on the faith bishar hollow the way galo in bhagavan's question bengali said if you have the faith complete faith the god is there god comes in this type of form and god can liberate me can remove all my desires and my ego and i can see oh i am god myself there is no difference it was only the imagination that i am bound i was crying it is only my imagination that i saw that snake on the street and i was wondering how to save myself imagination there is no snake at all so this is the way if we can understand this is the avatar suramar krishna is indicating and we can remember in the bible the lord jesus is also telling he who has seen the son has seen the father he who has seen the son has seen the father that means the avatar they mentioned in the bible and the christian tradition they say the god and the son the begotten son but we say it's the god himself is coming down so this is the difference the holy spirit in between the concept that that god cannot come directly so he has dedicated his son and they are communicating through the holy spirit that is a trinity of the christian tradition there's a conception but that way they try to explain and hindus they explain in a different way is a god himself is coming down and that god is manifesting in different form at different times it in different names so that is the why that's why the hindus they accept jesus as the incarnation of god there's no problem we accept lord buddha as an incarnation of god there is no problem because we see all the divine qualities manifested through these characters so unity among all these religious paths it is present in hinduism because of his very conception is like that friends you know that there will be in the next month 16 17 18 october there will be of course in a the online uh as a parliament of religion and different religions they're presenting and the different forms uh i am also going to speak on behalf of the hinduism to the zoroastrians the group up there and we will also have our own program the hinduism and different scholars they will be speaking not only ramakrishna mission swami's the other spiritual aids a different of the uh the sakes of the hinduism they will also take part and some professors are there they'll be speaking hinduism from different mainly three angles so that is there so when i am going to the that main topic that they gave me what hinduism thinks about the unification of different religions this is all same so that is why the hinduism accepts all maybe the river has in different places it has been created from the top of that mountain this mountain this place but all water goes to the ocean so that is the way we accept here the jesus is also saying he who has seen the son has seen the father but there is another idea they say rishito rishi hood those who have understood the truth realize that truth that all these things are coming from one that conception rishi so that complete knowledge about the idea about the creation and the creator but they don't accept the abutara they say rishi is there that rishi he knows everything naturally he is having that power too that we find in one of the spinoza you know that the philosophy western philosophy and he is writing a letter in his later two oldenburg he is giving that conception about the jesus christ jesus is not a human being don't accept him in the in that way but it is the manifestation of the knowledge the he realized that anyone can have that that's true the rishitv is all right but abutara is different we can realize brahman we can become rishi any individual can become a rishi rishi hood that is okay but we cannot become avatar not any individual soul can become avatar we can get realization of the brahman and become brahman the those who have realized brahman has become brahman that is the statement and but one cannot become avutara why dare the supreme being from his own power through his own power utilizing his own maya shakti he is manifesting as the navathara that we cannot become it is not possible so abutara it is different and this conception of the abu tara that came is from the krishna so in the bhagavata it is very very prominently mentioned as bhagavan suramar krishna is mentioning over here why i am living in this way he is indicating that if anyone is respecting accepting and getting the blessings of bhagavan siddharama krishna he will be liberated just accepting sirama krishna why because he himself is the god so that he's mentioning he's mentioning in such a way if the people you know sometimes not directly in the indication but the people those who are really intelligent they will understand it that's why swami vivekananda after a lot of an examination he was having doubt about the the divinity of bhagavan's krishna even he was telling is he truly god when the the sudama he was tormenting outwardly and he was almost in the verge of death that time also after being experiencing so many things he touched sudama krishna tustin narendra and for three days and three nights he had the experience of advaita vedanta he said everything is the same same consciousness he under realized that and not only that a few days before of his passing away when narendra was meditating he forgot his body he saw the all-pervading consciousness there so many those who have read that you know that that even after that he wanted to know on that critical moment oh now that he is going to die at this time would he be able to say that he is god at that very moment bhagavan sirama krishna said o naren he who was rama he who was krishna now in this body as sriram krishna abu tara this the god himself coming down in different form with the power of his maya shakti is no one can create only god that supreme being so now if we accept that and if we are saluting dedicating devoted to sadama krishna mukti liberation is sure that he is mentioning over there whoever salutes an incarnation even wants that means with the great the respect complete dedication understanding whom he is saluting just oh there's a holy man go and touch his feet and he will go and touch his feet without knowing who is he not like that understanding accepting that and if he is going and saluting he says immediately obtain liberation had brought a basket of sweet meats for srirama krishna master who has brought these sweets baburam pointed to mahini mohan sirama krishna touched those sweets uttering the word om and ate a little then he distributed them among the devotees to the surprise of the others he fed the younger naren and a few of the boys with his own hand so a master mashay is noticing and then reporting that this is happening a few are there very young to them suramar krishna is more compassionate and he is feeding them with his own hand you can imagine the blessedness just now we discuss that he is the god himself he is in the human form and he has taken the name sri ramakrishna but he is no other than sri rama or sri krishna he is the supreme being in that form and when he is touching that it becomes immediately sanctified and he is distributing those switched with all those who were assembled over there and at the same time the special is feeding those young boys so afterwards their life turned and they became very holy particularly we know the babura maharaja he was a very very loving soul and baburam is feeding them master to aim this has a meaning there is a greater manifestation of god in man a pure heart when he was feeding those particular boys and then naturally master mache was inquisitive to know why this why not he is feeding to all or just touching and then sanctifying that particular those sweet mates and giving to the devotees to this for distribution so why is this special the surama krishna giving the answer to his silent christian he is telling this as meaning there is a greater manifestation of god in men of pure heart what is the pure heart they don't have association of the attachment with the worldly objects that's called pure heart those who are having those not that the someone is leaving for a long time alone and practicing this that but if he is having the desire for the worldly things then he is not a pure heart pure heart means completely different not that he is only eating some particular type of food and he is becoming he is pure or drinking only milk or the ganga water and becoming pure it's nothing like that it's the thought when we are craving for the worldly objects the name fame physical comfort and all this is the impure mind anything when the mind is goes towards the god it becomes pure it goes opposite to the creation of god this world impure this again and again the purity and impurity so this is the purity the because there is a meaning men are pure heart in former years when i used to go to kamar pugh i would feed some of the young boys with my own hand and chinu shakari would say why doesn't he feed us that way but how could i delayed an immoral life who would feed them friends this is very clear those who practice the immoral life is not it's not not that only is having the family not not like that but i understand immoral life is a different thing where something that you are not supposed to do you are breaking the moral line that is called immorality so that immoral life when you are leaving the obviously a god is away because you are very much attached to those things you like those things and obviously the god is obey the purity means understanding the futility of these worldly things and dedicating the mind towards god so this is bhagavan sirama krishna the chinu shakari we know about this person those who have read the biography the chinu shakari when the he was very young bhagavan sirama his name was gadadhar and he used to call him as gaday and that means the unappeated of the vishnu the gadai and he used to feed him and telling him gada you are not ordinary human being you must be god the chinu shakari was also good even then the sudama krishna is telling it was very hard to feed him directly sudama krishna was in the happiest mood with his young and pure soul devotees she was seated on the small couch and was doing ima in funny imitation of a kritani the devotee is laughed heartily the kirtani is dressed lavishly and covered with jewelries she sings standing on the floor and look at it how the sudama krishna is talking about krishna who is indicating that he is the navatara the god incarnated in human form and that bhagavan suramar krishna is behaving just like an ordinary person having some fun so this is the spirituality the spirituality doesn't mean that you every time every moment you have to hang your face and the grave we you have to be nothing like that it's just joy how the people are behaving he's imitating that it's a very funny way so that just they're having the font as a joy not that he's hurting them that's imitating something and making the so spirituality means complete joy very normal life very very normal life everything only for all the moment 24 hours every every moment awareness is there this world is very temporary it is an imagination nothing is real so i am not going to give any thought about these worldly things not getting attest to anything and i'm not having my ego i should go on removing my ego and instead i will have the self-confidence that i am the pure because i am that tattwa mercy the great dictum of the veda i am that pure so constantly but at the same time when leaving daily life sometimes having fun talking with the friends visiting the places enjoying different things on a test way so he is having that fun the devotees were convulsed with the laughter at his mimicry by sirama krishna at this mimicry by sirama krishna pultu rolled on the ground pointing to him the master said to him look at that child he is rolling with laughter he said to poltu with a smile don't report this to your father or he will lose the little respect he has for me you see he is an english man english man means in those days sudama krishna is to use this word but that means the educated person and in the educated person they were the britishers used to rule india that time and mainly the influence of that education that you must be your etiquette should be like this a holy man should not behave like this you should not be like this but sirama krishna was just a happy child of god so he was making that fun and they and the pole 2 was rolling paltu was the most young so he enjoyed that he was rolling on the ground while he was laughing and sudama krishna said don't report it to your father that whatever little respect that he is having for me as a holy man that will be lost so this is called guideless free spiritual life no hiding no unnecessarily what we are not what i am not that's showing no hypocrisy spirituality means very pure life and what is the purity not having any attraction for the worldly things living in the world but not of that whatever the responsibility performing but without any attachment and a very free life so that is the reason so most of the people they'll be seeing like a drama they'll be to impress people sometime in the name of religion some of the things that people will do that is not correct and no hypocrisy at all pure so that's ramakrishna is mentioning see in this way in we learn so many things about the true spiritual religious life from the gospel of sirama krishna almost in every pages in every description we are learning and it's getting revealed that what is spirituality what is religion master to the devotees there are people who indulge in all kinds of gossip at the time of their daily devotions as you know one is not permitted to talk then so they make all kinds of sign keeping their lips closed in order to say bring this bring that they make sounds like who are all such things they do and then they all are laughing so we are supposed to be silent when we are doing or working in the temple and why we should take the name of god we should remember the purpose we have come to visit the holy place and if we forget that sitting over there since we are not supposed to talk you are making some sound to say something and going on gesturing posturing there is also no use you must be sincere you must know what to do and when to do and suzama krishna was telling again there are some who bargain for fish while telling their beads some of the people they do like that as they count the rosary with finger they point to the fish indicating that one please and they re reserve all their business for that time so when taking the name of god they are doing like that these are all unnecessary the hypocrisy it is not necessary when you are in the market they do the the purchasing and all the whatever so obviously when you are going for purchasing something pay attention to that why unnecessarily you have to inside if you can do you do by showing up religion has nothing to do like that there are women who come to the ganges for their bath and instead of thinking of god gossip about no end of things you see they have come to bathe in the holy river and yet they indulge in all sorts of worldly talks when you go to bed in the holy place or visiting some holy places we should remember that and what is this why we should do that because it is the mind only whatever we think that is accumulating in the mind and that is going to happen and if i think i am going to bathe in this river where all the great rishis they have taken bath all the holy people they stand over here and take the name of god for hundreds and hundreds of years they are doing it then obviously your mind will be completely detached from the worldly thoughts and that moment you become pure so if this idea is there that worldly thoughts should not be at that moment when i am trying to perform the holy things but at least for time being i'll be free from the worldly thoughts and the mind will become pure so step by step i'm going to temple i should think about god only i should take the holy name of god whatever i have read and heard about god that i should try to remember not any other thing when i am going to cook for god when i am going to do something in the temple all the time those are the things that will make your mind completely free otherwise living in that holy place or visiting that holy place spending some time over there if your mind goes to the worldly thought you are living in the world why mano eva manusanam it is the mind of the human being there is the cause of bondage or liberation what is the bondage barton did that circle how it comes because of my attachment to the worldly things very simple so it is just like a mathematics if we are thinking about the worldly things we go back to world how after death again we take the birth and again in this world and because the desires are there that will go to happen and this is the reason one must be very very careful very very careful the thoughts should be always under god and how it is possible take the name of god because god's name and god are same taking the name of god is as purity as talking to god as looking at god the same that is again the bhagavatam krishna said name of god and the god are same so this is the way we have to understand so people they are coming to vedi in the ganga but go on gossip for something else they are of course bathing but as because they were taking the deep in the holy river that blessings of the holiness is not coming because their mind was not there we go to the temple but think about something else or gossip for something else so we are not getting the benefit of visiting the holy place so that is the idea the master began to look intently at the young naren and went into samadhi did he see god himself in the pure soul devotee so master mashay was wondering looking at a young boy sirama krishna he looked intently and went into samadhi so the master mahashaya is wondering whether could he see that god present in that holy mind a devotee silently was the figure of sirama krishna motionless in samadhi a few minutes before there had been so much laughter in the room now there was deep silence as if no one were there the master sat with the folded hands as in his photograph the ceramic krishna photo was taken afterwards and it we are so lucky that this time only and the first time that we can get the real picture of god how he was no imagination ramacandas all those the picture that we see the photos all imagination the artists are painting in that way krishna also the same thing it is ramakrishna that time the science advanced and we could take the photograph in the camera obviously must and this devotee silently was the figure of sudama krishna who is this devotee master himself he has mentioned in the gospel many times about aim of the master the teacher of a school and sometimes the devotee in different names after a short while his mind began to come down to the relative plane he heaved a long sign and became aware of the outer world he looked at the devotees and began to talk with them of their spiritual progress see sometimes when we go to the deep sleep and after the deep sleep when you come back slowly many people we have the experience can't remember actually where we are have you experienced that then when you get up from your deep sleep you were sleeping in such a way and suddenly you got up and you can't recognize what is this place what is the time is the morning or is this the afternoon or where i am you were on your own bed you were in the same room but it doesn't come in the mind those who go into samadhi they forget the external all those things where you are sitting what the people and environment everything they forget because their mind goes to the stillness where there is no two there is only one there is only consciousness and from there slowly they are coming back so that we can have little idea of that the person like bhagavan suramar krishna is bhuttita buddhita means coming down from that spiritual plane and here he is and we can have this a little bit of that experience from deep sleep master to the young naren i have been eager to see you you will succeed come here once in a while well which do you prefer guyana or bhakti and the young narin pure bhakti he is telling this young is not narendra or not narendra not is different he's a young different person the master but how can can you love someone unless you know him pointing to him means his teacher with a smile how can you love him unless you know him since a pure soul person has asked for pure bhakti it must have some meaning pure soul we have discussed and he is asking for the bhakti it has a meaning one does not see bhakti of one's own accord one does not seek bhakti of one's own accord without inborn tendencies this is the characteristic of prema bhakti there is another kind of bhakti called gyana bhakti which is love of god based on reasoning so he is explaining this usually cerama krishna is to say the baidee bhakti the ritualistic way you have to that is the bhakti and when you are practicing that these are the things you should do and regularly practicing slowly generates to the prema bhakti and then urjita bhakti that means he go uh get as completely associated with the god and now he is telling about the gyana bhakti this gana bhakti the knowledge about the god and this is god is like this etc then the bhakti means one pointedness to the young naren let me look at your body take off your shirt fairly broad chest you will succeed come here now and then this is the this called samudravidya this is a kind of a very special knowledge by seeing different and the body feature the surama krishna could say the his future and his past also that he was a special very special of krishna he could sometimes you will be weighing the hand the from the finger up to the elbow he'll be going and then he'll say oh his mind is this he is like this type that type there is a very special knowledge that he had and it is known as samudrabidda that he was asking and after seeing his body he said he may realize god and sudama krishna was still in the ecstatic mood he spoke tenderly to the other devotees about their future when he was talking about the younger naren the others were also eager to know what is going to happen to us but he looked to them and said the tenderly to the pull too that young boy he will succeed too but it will take a little time to baburam why don't i attract you to me it is just to avoid trouble baburama was very pure but this ramakrishna told that i am not attracting as because to trouble white trouble mother baburam's mother was very very devoted and she naturally uh the mother losing the sun the sun is going away so that's why it's afterwards you know what happened he asked his mother mother came to give some gift to suramar krishna and suramar krishna told if you'd like to give me a gift gift your son let him become a monk let him be with me i will train him trained him with how to become a monk the mother she gave her son they were very rich people still that the area is there they have given to the ramakrishna mission ramakrishna aslam has come up over there the babura maharaja family were very rich and they were landlord the mother baburama's mother when the sirama krishna told okay and she dedicated gave the son to suramar krishna why don't he attract you to me it is just to avoid trouble mahi as for you you are all right there is a little yet to be done when that is achieved nothing will remain neither duty nor work not the world itself is it good to get rid of everything about the mahi mahjong because everybody was eager we can feel had we been there so naturally what he is mentioning about me so what is going to happen to me and sudama krsna spoke these words he looked at mahini affectionately as if scanning his inmost feeling was mahini really wondering whether it would be wise to renounce all for god after a while sirama krishna said god binds the bhagavata pandith to the world with one thai otherwise who would remain to explain the sacred book he keeps the pundit bound for the good of men that is why the divine mother escaped you in the world so sometimes there's some good people the they will be naturally it is also necessary god has created this universe and through the holy people dedicated people so he goes on giving the and the teaching to these worldly people that what is the right path so that's why he was mentioning about meaning now siram krsna spoke to the young brahmin the one young brahmin boy he was there and he said give up knowledge and reasoning accept bhakti bhakti alone is the essence is this the third day of your stay here the that young boy he was staying there suramar krishna is giving the direct instruction it's very rare type he was usually used to say whatever these are the things whatever you like but here for his benefit he's telling don't go for reasoning and don't try to follow the path of knowledge rather take the bhakti and he said have faith depend on god then you will not have to do anything yourself mother kali will do everything for you mother kali will do everything for you it's a great statement because if we can depend on god god will do everything for any for only thing that we need is the faith faith in the existence of god god is there thank you friends we will start our reading and discussion next time from this topic that the kali goddess kali mother kali will do everything for you if you have faith now if there is any question so the first question is from biryandra majumdar he is asking by the blessings of shri gurudev thakur's barney is very pleasant to us what will happen to us for reista shall the human beings like me in their 60s all my prayers will go in vain how can that be so you know that if you have the faith in the pure words of bhagavan si rama krishna and if you are taking his name praying to him not a single word will go in vain so i have kept over here in my table ma sharadamani devi's photo and his quote the in bengali she is telling sheikhigo you understand that the sramakrishna's name that we are taking it is great value the name itself will purify our mind will all the bondages all the desires all the ego automatically it will go so only regularly pray to god and say i am at your mercy oh god please hold my hand and take me to you thank you swarup is asking the next question how can we identify our thoughts who might be around us oh that is very very difficult you know avatar is a completely different type and it is not that the power of god is manifesting a little bit here and there avutara is different the god himself is coming in that human form and manifesting at that time the people those who are really very pure order and when it is necessary for them to know the god himself will attract them and they will know about dhaba but at this moment it is better that the avatara they who have come and given us their teachings it is better to understand those teachings imbibe those teachings and lead our life according to that teaching that will be sufficient shrima brzee is asking the next question how to keep ourselves worldly object being green how to keep ourselves free free how to keep ourselves free from worldly object being green so you know that worldly object means that we need some shelter suppose you're purchasing a house nothing wrong you like to leave over there but when we talk about us bhagavan sirama krishna is talking about the worldly objects that some people are there who are greedy type they constantly and they inside they always think that there is no god forget about god and if they are taking the name of god for their selfish motive to fulfill their selfish purposes so they are grahas that those who are living in the household are not that way gree they are just doing their dharma there's nothing wrong wrong in it that's why bhagavan's krishna again and again says sudama krishna also mentioning so but only thing inside don't have attachment for those things if you don't have the attachment then you are not bound whether you are living in the palace or living under a tree it is all the same if you don't have the attachment thank you dave johnny devjon is asking the next question what is the difference between samudra and tantra as i was mentioning they're very special looking at a physical and a different type of uh things in the body so some people could say but bhagavan sirama krishna this was very special not that all the time used to say but sometimes when he went to meet the father of ravindhantega he also asked him to open his chest to see whether the kundalini has a calm up to that etc it's very difficult to explain and the tantra is a capturing the power over the nature there's the tantra shakthi and it is having you know that tantric so many powers are there so up to this but we should not be interested for these powers these are also temporary that is why bhagavan si ramakrishna again and again mentioned that don't bother about this power go to god who is love and unselfishness and then enjoy complete freedom well thank you then let us chant this mantra and finish our today's discourse [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] namaste
