[394. Panchama Veda - “God Surely Listen To Prayers”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dQVy1_om_E)

namaskar dear devotees and Friends and today let us begin the panchama Veda the gospel of sirama Krishna as usual with that mantra jivanam Kalam angalam foreign foreign will be the last of this session 2022 and after January and February vacation we will meet again in March friends we are reading from the gospel of sirama Krishna page 792 and the Bengali Bengali book akanda katham Rita that is Page 852 in spiritual life ultimate stage is nirvaratha or the dependence there is the ultimate now we are discussing from the point of view of Duality not non-duality so I remind it every time because the most of the time the swamis particularly ramakrishna Mission swamis when they speak they speak from the vedantic point of view most mostly so sometimes we get confused it is actually the two ah objects always we are see that one is from the point of view of the advaita vedanta where there is no two another there is from the point of view The Duality now at this moment when bhagwan's ramakrishna is and he also you will find you also he is constantly mixing the dweta and the Twitter now God is there God is the supreme power and his creation this universe now he the god he has created this universe out of his own this is the proven fact everyone they have understood it particularly among the Hindus they always say yes now the question is why we cannot see God why we suffer because God is the source of Joy God is the source of Happiness God is the source of Eternity now we die so obviously if you'll doubt so if I am God then why I am dying we suffer if I am God that why I am suffering so these are the questions all the time all Through the Ages up to ages is coming and that the vedantin will give the answer that dueten will say it is the Divine Play of God and advaithin will say it is actually not happening it is the act of Maya as you see things in your dream which is not actually true but in dream you feel it is true and you suffer or enjoy and the so-called this life awakened life is also the same Krishna he is giving the how to go beyond this the first we have studied that in the page 792 he said the stages of sadhana the private and then siddha the four stages he is planning to he is thinking well now I am retired now all my family Duties are over let me think of God instead of other thing let me think of God that is the and or in the young age also sometimes some people because of their past birth impression they think let me think about God I have seen the life of my grandfather my father and all around people same thing repeating oh no let me think about God so as the Lord Buddha he thought the and in that way they start so this is called prabharthaka they are starting beginning so they are asking questions they are studying books they are trying to follow these follow that it's going on then they choose one path and when they choose one path that is the final the I will choose the path of devotion I like it I like to talk to God I like to pray to God I like to sing before God I like to cook and feed God so that is also devotion it goes in the devotional path some meditation and some know God and all those maybe they are there so let me think in a different way it is the Atman the Consciousness the fourth stage that is so let me think of that so that also won the meditation then The Path of Knowledge in the Hinduism the all varieties are open you can choose according to your choice according to your aptitude and The Path of Knowledge in that Path of Knowledge it is always that you can thinking the Brahma dhyana they say constantly there is no time there is no dress there is no place nothing all the time you're constantly putting your mind at that Consciousness that is called Brahma dhyana so that way it goes the something that's okay if God has created this universe everything is made of God why can't I go and serve the god the living gods and goddesses the Swami Vivekananda introduced that Karma Yoga path in the Modern Age it is very easy apparently but because our active mind like to work but you give only the turn what is the turn when I am working I am serving I am serving God that attitude should be always there I am not serving this person or that person I am serving God so that is the way when you can think that karma yoga this is ramakrishna is said it is the four different stages and then the sadaka becomes become after the practice practice and he feel Joy within and he is convinced that this is my path I should follow this stick to this and ultimately what happens he goes into that ideal which is nothing but the love and unselfishness and in love and unselfishness there is only joy the only happiness that is why in the upanishad it says the Creator is the source of happiness from the source of Happiness everything has been created bhutani jayanti into Punisher Ananda Eva kalu truly collude truly from Ananda from The Joy Imani that's why we are all the time pursuing for joy sometimes we are getting and sometimes we are not so we get tired of the joys that we get from the world and we turn towards spiritual life and the problem is the body body is sick body is suffering body needs these body needs that that is also there so from the young age when the body is strong mind is strong one should try to realize God so this is the word bhagavan's ramakrishna said and he said you know the God is under the control of the devotee it's a big word God is under the control of the devotee how in the in the family is if there is a baby is a child he or she that child actually maintaining the whole family whenever the child wants these he'll be starting crying and then all people will come the two satisfied like that you have to control the God why you are not here then the the devotee will cry David you will pray and the God will come running as the mothers are coming running to the children same way that is the relation the relation of love that is a unique relation relation of love there is no fear and there is no barter I will give you this many things then I will chant this many things mantras and all then the God will be satisfied it is all external but when the God is my father God is my mother where is all those straight way we go and tell to the shall I go and be stand before my father and chant oh Father you were born in this family on such this day the father will say what happened to you so naturally same way when you go to God we need not to do that when you develop that Faith the God is my father or God is my mother I belong to God as the Jesus said I and my Father in Heaven are one as bhagavan sidama Krishna said that mother and I are same the similarly and then the vedanta will say all every different languages different way they say I am that when that comes that is called a completely mature spiritual life now what happens when this attitude comes see ramakrishna is giving a beautiful example through an anecdote a bird it was sitting on a mast of a ship and when it sailed the bird didn't aware of it it was maybe sleeping and when it was the ship was in that big ocean then he woke up and oh my God where is the land I can't see anything you started flying towards the east he couldn't see anything only water it came back then the west then the north then the South no land anywhere then it came back and without any effort sat on the mast thinking in this way oh this ship is going to reach to somewhere I will reach there that is called surrender to God now I am going to Himalaya I am going to ours I am going to fast I am going to do this all these efforts then afterwards okay God will take me to the directions let me depend on God that is called self surrender and that is called nirvata Nirvana means depending depending on God completely so this is and then bhagavan's ramakrishna said and Captain was very happy when he heard this story he said oh wonderful illustration he said but the worldly people wonder about the four quarters why to get the joy friends we have said many a times and we have experienced also in our life the our goal for everything that we do is joy we go to purchase a car that also for our enjoyment the car should be comfortable it should be these it should be that we purchase a house we start a business we marry we settle down as everything whatever we do ultimate thing is I should be happy with that so they are trying trying and trying like that bar it goes every corner all quarters but you don't find why because they're going outside it is not the joy is not outside it is within so he is mentioning when through that their attachment to last and gold they only suffer misery they feel and argue towards the dispassion and renunciation the last and gold the last of the craving to enjoy the worldly things and to satisfy and to get that we need money so go last and goal that again and again he said because of that most people cannot renounce lost in Gold without fast enjoying it there are two shorts of people those who stay in the one plane and another is who is going about many places they move like that but what is there to enjoy the war now comes the Discrimination what is there to enjoy this war the last in Gold that is only a momentary pleasure is so true everything that we get is a momentary pleasure so suppose we are thinking that we will be going to Glasgow in Great Britain oh Glasgow we will go what will happen we are going to visit the London and the queen's palace and these that you go you stand you see and then goes that much then you take the photograph then picture and then sometimes you most of the time people take a lot of photos but they do not see that and where is the time to go back to see only in the memory oh that was wonderful time we had they'll be exchanging nodes the frames they'll be exchanging nodes among themselves that was a wonderful time in London we had these we had that all temporary wherever we like to go to visit everything temporary going to a good hotels places of eating temporary so after that when you become mature in our life and when you look back our life yes everything is so temporary we were having our uncles and aunties and these and that now slowly slowly slowly in the family I am only leaving all have gone there's so much of tension was there for little thing we used to call with each other now everything is left who is going to get that who is going to have that we do not need that so that is called understanding and after that understanding that everything is temporary and nothing can give me the permanent Joy or happiness if a person turned towards the god that is called spiritual journey Sometimes some people to forget those start they started drinking lot of wine and then take the narcotics they like to forget but that is not the answer you cannot forget this evening you drink a lot and then you lie down forgetting next morning all those thoughts they will come back again so this is the way we have to understand then the world is like an overcast sky that steadily Pours Down rain the face of the sun is seldom seen bhagavanama Krishna he is describing this world the crystal jewel of discrimination is a beautiful book vedantic book of shankaracharya he is also viviately describing this body what is there in this body we are so much fascinated we are so much attached to this body but what is there the doctors they know it is nothing but still you know just we imagine that it is wonderful we imagine that the gold is very costly gold is wonderful it's just glittering that's all it's nothing but some material they are glittering that much and we we the human beings say gold is this then we made the jewelries then those who are having much they are rich people it is all we are creating the other is gold was there we saw that at the Euler sort of thing and then it is glittering so we started liking it all over the world people started thinking and suppose someday it changes then what will happen so that all this jewelries the stones then we are giving the all the interest on that otherwise if we forget then it is nothing now the monks are not having anything but they are living and happily they are living what is the problem so this is the way if we think then we'll find this world is actually nothing and it says on account of the cloud of lust and gold one cannot see the sun bhagavan Cinema Krishna is mentioning some people ask me sir why has God created such a world is there no way out for us in the pages of the Gospel of bhagavan's ramakrishna will find so many time in different places different time people are asking the same question why because this is the real the the question or the urge that people like to know in the world there is suffering we all know Lord Buddha said this world is full of misery and suffering and then the chatwari Arya satwani the four very the great truth but what is that the only they begin with the dukkha vedant also says this is all Maya but for whom those were understood it those who have not for them let them continue that's why bhagavad-gita mentions now that is in different way it is mentioning those who like to enjoy this world let them continue but they themselves after these one after another experience once they will say oh enough is enough now I do not want this I want only happiness but I have tried everything I am not getting that extreme happiness where I will get it so let them continue and experience it like the young people the children let them experience but those who are intelligent those who have the in their past birth some good Impressions they have already understood it realized it now in this birth in the very young life itself they start asking question no no where is the source of Joy I don't want these worldly things the young people they are becoming monks they're becoming nuns they are giving up the whole world all the physical enjoyments and the whole life on one point focused why because the past birth they had done already now in this life some people even at the younger age they have started thinking they are taking initiation they are practicing meditation they're reading good books and developing the relations with the devotees and living leading of course they are earning money working some places completing their study at the same time a part of their mind young at the young people having the green religion in the younger generation understanding these why because the intellect they have realized this this world of course I have to be here because there is no other way but at the same time that we also should understand this is not permanent thing so we have seen so many young people are having these ideas so this is the way we are proceeding towards God and then we are holding the hand of bhagwan's ramakrishna who is leading us towards God and he is giving us all options and here is saying the wind the people are asking how to go beyond this then the sudama Krishna he is mentioning take shelter with God why shouldn't there be a way out if you have realized these worldly life is futile you cannot get joy the people are purchasing the Palaces on the bank of the ocean overlooking the ocean very very costly palaces how long they are living over there how long they are looking at the ocean how long they are enjoying the vastness of that ocean ask them nothing but still they are spending so much of money only for that okay they think that they will get joy maybe once in a while they are all rich people and very highly busy people and they don't have time to go they'll be asking their friends to go and enjoy that Palace when they occasionally may be once in a while in the year they will go and one or two days they will be sitting over there looking at the ocean and then that that the enjoyment no so this is called spirituality not that we are not asking them to purchase the but don't think that is the source of Joy it is only that much instead if you help people those who are suffering instead of spending so much of money for all those things if you give that money to the poor people you will get joy why because you are helping God God in the form of this those depressed people the suffering masses ignorant people they're all gods turn your mind to that that is also that is called Pure Karma Yoga here he is mentioning when that person was asking sir why has God created such a world is there no way out for us I say to them why shouldn't there be a way out take shelter with God and pray to him with a yearning heart now the devotional path Karma Yoga in one way dhyana yoga Ghana yoga here bhagavan SI ramakrishna said why don't you take the devotional path God is there take shelter take shelter and with the yearning heart for a favorable wind that you may have things in your favor if you call on him with yearning he will surely listen to you so this is the truth when we are praying to God and slowly slowly God sometimes what happens you know that we think that this is the only life we are having oh God why this pain in my body and I was calling on you praying to you please remove the pain sometimes it is not going so you are suffering then I lose the faith in God no because of the pain I could remember God the one of our swamiji was telling it is better that he was suffering and when you suffer you go to God great the prayer of the kunti the mother of the five brother hero Brothers that law the kunti she was praying to the Krishna Krishna you have protected me protected us I am thankful to you but I pray Krishna keep me all the time in some trouble so that I pray to you I remember you I do not forget you that is called devotee the devotee wants to love God wants to remember God and for that these particular suffering will take my mind to God oh God please keep that suffering to me that insult to me the people are not liking me it's a good people are not liking me I will go to you I will pray to you this very heroic words we all want that everyone should be fair very friendly to me and every should every work of Mind words of mine should be appraised by people appreciated by people these are all ordinary but this is the challenges I like to go to you for that if there is problems I think that is good because I will remember you constantly I don't have any friend around here you are my only so there are great lives are there and in those lives we find because of the like the Meera those who have read the life of mirabai they they know that mirabai was criticized by everyone doubted by everyone and you can imagine the Contemporary world where she was leaving everybody is doubting that ladies character because she used to close the door and sing that much she used to do she was not going out she was closing her room and she used to sing and people will be doubting why she is singing there must be someone she must be a loose character lady but Meera went on praying to God and that's why even today everyone any devotee they will never forget Meera they will read the biography of Meera they will get the inspiration from that life so Cinema Krishna is telling that you have to go on praying how I am dying God I am dying there's so much problem please come and save me things will take form slowly slowly and a man had his son now that is the uniqueness of bhagavan's ramakrishna he always had that you know that today is the Titi Puja of saradananda ji Maharaj and that saradhananda ji Swami saradananda sharat maharaji's premonistic name was sarath Chandra and the he depended on bhagavan's Rama Krishna and in his biography if you read the he was traveling in the India the people the swamis they like to walk and they go from different places and wherever you go a ocher cloth is a sannyasi respected everywhere even the decoys and the bad people the Wayward people they will also respect you and they will never disturb you there's a great respect for the holy people so all these swamis these two and in those days that was the tradition the wandering Monk so he was going somewhere in Himalaya he'd lost the way the he was supposed to go to a village we lost the way and it became Dirk and it was very difficult what to do then he started meditating sitting on a stone that was a the place we can imagine inside the jungle a big Stone was there he's got up on that and started meditating and it was infested by the wild animals that place so obviously but he was not afraid he was thinking it's okay because the God is there God will take care of me whole night he meditated the challenging situation he turned it in favorable to a spiritually favorable so what will happen to me or the Tiger may come and and crying and shouting and the all the time criticizing God I prayed to God all through my life and these this them not like that I'm very happy okay if this is the last moment that has come maybe a tiger will come and eat me and before death let me meditate on God so that is called nirbharata that is called dependence they were criticizing anything any and that is spirituality to some we are confused about spirituality you always think that everything should be favorable it will be very favor favorable but if we depend on God and this shardananda Ji as the bhagavan sirama Krishna gave the example that a bird after flying in every place came and sat on the Mast he also after thinking how to go how to go ok he also sat quietly remembering the god the Suraj Chandra chakraborty was born in Calcutta and 23rd December and 1865. a very gentle by Nature he was influenced observing his mother's devotion to the family deity so the parents actually they are the first teachers if the mother or the father they are very devoted or very gentle very and they influence the child's mind the most of the time we complain that the school is not giving proper education the Society of course their influence is there but the best influence is always from the mother and the father and in the beginning maybe the children they won't Express they can't express that way but afterwards all those things that they observe that the mother is praying to the God and she's so kind to the poor and the father is also very courteous gentle all those goals in the impression and when they grew up when they see others they compare then they think oh my father was like God my mother was like goddess they are so good so they get influence the sardananda the young boy the sarath he got influence from his mother and he started praying to God and meditating on God he came to bhagavan sirama Krishna after reading an article that was published in the Indian mirror written by the famous keshav chandrushen came in contact with sirama Krishna and he started writing about him so this is a very unique movement this ramakrishna Movement we always say that what is this ramakrishna movement it is a spiritual movement which always teaches the broadness catholicity and you say that any path can lead you to God any path only you should be genuine whatever path you are accepting different religions also and not only we are just tolerating we are accepting it it is not his only question of Toleration that is called ramakrishna movement that is the final answer for this presenting world and this ramakrishna movement was not supported by any King till now the 125 years it passed no King no rich people supported only little donation that from the general people General mosses and Dad the the movement is carried by dedicated people the dedicated men and women they are going out and spreading this message till now no support from the the government or all this the Sharad Chandra he was influenced by that reading that then he came to bhagwan's ramakrishna and sinama Krishna after coming over then he became very much an attracted to sudama Krishna he started frequenting very through ramakrishna in dakshinesha and one day he said when the talk was going on you have to have a god or goddess as your ideal and you should remember that God and God is and all the qualities of that god or goddess you should imbibe what is initiation what is the spiritual practice if you are selecting one God on Goddess that should be your ideal not that we are hating others they are there we respect them but this particular ideal I like so I choose that is called Eastern Star in the words of bhagwan Cinema Krishna Easter a chosen ideal nishta as a attached to that dedicated to that this young boy the sharat he told Ganesha is my ideal I like Ganesha immediately bhagavan sidama Krishna he corrected him no Shiva is your idea not Ganesha so see the Ganesha of course the son of Shiva but the Sheba is the ideal of saradananda those who have read the biography of the sharadananda ji he will they will lie no as the Sheba means auspiciousness all difficulties the Shiva will accept that when they were churning the ocean and the Venom started coming then there was no one to accept that the shiba came and took that and that is all the way the praise the Lord Shiva the sudama Krishna collected him he had another cousin brother the Sharad Maharaja Shashi the sharat and Shashi the tools towards in the ramakrishna movement the the Shashi also is to come to srama Krishna bhagavan sirama Krishna is to say these two brothers they were in the group of Jesus Christ I saw them there who is this Jesus the two thousand years before saw not only Jesus but the people of the Jesus who were close to Jesus they were followers of Jesus and after that they are coming to help this SRI ramakrishna in his Incarnation then who is this ramakrishna so these the this sharath Maharaj and he was the first general secretary he came to the West and he gave some wonderful lectures also but very calm and composed he never got agitated you know Swami Vivekananda was the Shiva himself and should be become the new that he don't have much time So within 40 years to complete his mission and in India as because from the 11th century onwards we can say and before that also it was the all Kings this to rule and obviously Ordinary People they never knew how to organize things the Kings will be doing Kings people will be doing so nature traditionally the Indians they never knew how to organize the Swami Vivekananda after coming over here started writing the latest over there you should organize these you should organize that way he saw the organization without the organization that we cannot take out this movement to the world so he made that organization the ramakrishna mission and made the saradhan and the ji the first general secretary you know that usually the secretary their their work is come all the time connecting with all the different works and everything was very quiet and composed and apparently as if he is not doing anything and Swami Vivekananda and he used to say hey why don't you do it quickly and that is not possible all the time we cannot do things immediately used to scold him and they were brothers when very close brothers and Vivekananda once said if the whole world leave me to Pro person will never leave me that is one is brahmananda another is sarada this saradananda ji was one day the Vivekananda was scolding him sitting on a big bench those who have visited balloon but still that bench is there wooden bench they were sitting on that and they were swamiji was scolding you are doing not doing these not doing that something they were telling saying some as you are saying then suddenly they saw some devotees are coming from outside and that is not the time to discuss in this way the sharadananda ji noticed and he brought the attention of the Vivekananda they are coming so will you continue or afterwards the swamiji said I will ah tell you all this afterwards then the devotees came hello high and all that then they when they left swamiji forgot actually what he was telling to sarathananda when he turned to asaradan he reminded look at it he should have taken that opportunity that ramiji has forgotten and he reminded the naren you were telling these things to me and will you continue swamiji became and is frustrated the I am scolding you and you are not at all Angry no if it is there he said that there's a type of fish and that blood is that they say they never behave a very maybe and the other precious will be jumping and trying to it is not like that they are very tame type of so swamiji said it is your blood is like that so this is like the Shiva a quiet calm whatever is happening that is for a long period of time he gave the complete form in the ramakrishna mission now it is an worldwide organization more than 200 centers all over the world 2 000 the monks are there working in this organization then the branch is there sarada mission that the educated girls ladies the same ideology they are also working of course completely separately they are doing and there are other organizations also the devotees so the Baba prachar shamiti so they are Baba prachar the ideology of bhagwan's ramakrishna Swami Vivekananda sarada also vedanta the devotees all over hundreds and thousands of devotees all over the world so they all started and this is Swami saradananda jihi did and sudama Krishna used to praise him I just remembered that when he talk about the nirvaratha when you talk about the dependence of God we can see and it will be wonderful if we read his biography and also the other direct disciples the unique lives now friends the bhagavan's ramakrishna said if you pray sincerely genuinely the prayer many of you know those who are regularly reading the gospel of sudama Krishna this bhagavan srama Krishna in the beginning of this is teaching he gave the the four the ways how it should the we can the the four steps to God realization we can see the how to realize God the first thing he said sadhu Sangha the holy company why the holy company to understand about God what is this God and what is going to happen if I realize God and how to realize God all these things we learn from sadhu Sangha those who have already realized God and how you will know they have already realized God as bhagavan's ramakrishna gave the criteria the that they should not have any mundane desires then lost and gold that is the thing they are not having at all if a person is having his family his children and all those at the same time talking about God you can listen but you must think that what is there any any personal interest is there so that is the reason Swami Vivekananda said religion should be learned from the monastics those who have given up everything in their life there is nothing but love and unselfishness so he said first the holy companion second you have to understand your mind you have to know yourself the that's called living in the Solitude nirijana bars sadhu Sangha nirijana bhasa means living in solitude that living alone most of the people living alone nowadays with their laptop and smartphone oh that is not the smartphone and laptop won't help you in developing spiritual life you should be all alone studying your own mind what type of desires what type of thoughts crossing your mind note it down that is called neerjanabasa examining one's own mind and then you should ask yourself what do you want do you like to be a person in the world enjoying the worldly things or you like to enjoy the spiritual life what is good and what is bad what is permanent and what is temporary what is going to happen this so that way the Discrimination the Bichara analysis then the fourth step comes the prayer when he says the pray pray sincerely and God will give the answer God will surely answer to your prayer what is that prayer this is the communication with God but we don't know what is God we don't have faith in God then how can he communicate so that is the reason the one young girl came a teenager you know they say the Western World teenagers they grow in a I don't know why but they become very separated very lonely they grow in their own way in the family not very well connected with the parents also just somehow leaving so that girl came the mother was again and again was telling why don't you talk to swamiji why don't you talk to swamiji then she said I don't know him how can I communicate how he will know me because he doesn't know me so I was listening to her and it was like yeah that's true the same way how can I communicate I don't know him so two prayer means we have to know God unless and until we know God how can he pray oh I will pray for you I'll pray for you that's all the work in a western way of civilization and if somebody is sick oh I will pray for you and then you forget you just type and then forget you know so that is the way no it is not that the prayer means very sincerely you have to communicate with God but for that you have to have the idea of God the faith in God the existence of God and the power that God is having the wonderful power all power that God is having then only you can pray and when you are praying for yourself is good but when you are praying for others much better oh God they are suffering please please help them now we can understand in one corner of the world the people are not having electricity no and tremendous cold they don't have food they don't have electricity they don't have water they are suffering but we don't feel that they're all human being they have the parents they have the children they are the other people they were happy people then certainly for some reason the political reason now they are suffering can't you pray for them so that is called we have to pray to God not out of emotion but with faith and faith comes from the association of the Holy person when you are talking to the holy person mixing with the Holy person the conviction comes yes so many things are happening but still all things are the problems are solved that is called the prayer when bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning through prayer and what type of the faith what type of Yearning now he is again as is his own he is giving an example a man had a son who was on the point of death in a frenzy he asked remedies of different people one of them said here is a remedy now what is the remedy fast it must rain when the star swathi is in the ascendant so this is the first condition then some of the Rain Must Fall into a skull human skull then a frog must come there to drink that water from the skull and the snake must Chase it and then when the snake is about to bite the frog the frog must hop away and the poison must fall into the skull you should give that patient a little of the poison and rain water from the skull so can you imagine if someone is giving this is the medicine you have to collect but the father he loved his son so much he immediately started the father said out eagerly to find the medicine when the star Swati was in the sky there is a star called Swati it started raining the fervently Heap said to God oh Lord please sit a skull for me searching here and there he at last found a skull with rain water in it so Sati the star was there then the rain then he found his skull and the skull was full of rain water again he prayed to God oh Lord oh Lord please besiege please help me I besies Thee please help me find the frog and the snake so this is the way almost like the impossible thing is becoming possible since he had great longing he got the frog and the snake also in the twinkling of an eye he saw a snake chasing a frog and as it was about to bite the Frog its poison fell into the skull now friends we may say is it true don't ask that question whether it is true or not but the way this ramakrishna is depicting the story that is telling the earnestness even almost impossible thing is possible if God Wills that is the idea we get that idea from this small anecdote that it is possible for God to do anything if one takes shelter with God and praise to him with great longing God will surely listen he will certainly make everything favorable the captain what an apt illustration the master is telling yes God makes everything favorable pray perhaps the aspirant doesn't marry thus he is able to develop his whole attention to God or perhaps his brothers earned the family's livelihood or perhaps his son takes on the responsibilities of the family then the aspirant will not have to uh on the responsibility then the aspirant happened have to bother about the war he can give 100 of his mind to God do we always ask for work why because our mind is it's not that quiet com and we don't want a hundred percent dedication to God you know if we go on increasing our japa our mantra whenever it is possible and slowly slowly we can develop the calmness and there in that when you are developing love for the reputation of God's name and another thing will come in the mind or if my responsibilities duties go down that is good so that is the way one should pray all these responsibilities that I am doing Let It Go from me let me be alone and let let me totally surrender to God how the morning they will get up and they will take the name of God and meditation then maybe they will go for a little breakfast and little hello to the monastic brothers and again they come and sit for meditation read the holy book sing the bhajans that whole 24 hours a routine in such a way there is nothing but the spirituality and God but that is the way that is called papasha and about the tapusha we always we have already mentioned and you all know there isika the physically we should be completely detached from the worldly thoughts worldly things mentally also we always pray for the betterment of others we should never ever think against anyone and bachika through the words also we should never criticize others that's why Maha sharadamani Devi said if you want peace I really wonder how she is giving the instruction if Jodi in Bengali if you want peace he otherwise you need not to listen to this but if you really want peace don't find fault with others why when you are finding fault with others and actually all those bad qualities you are remembering again and again and it is imprinting within your mind coming to you only so that is why the mass or the Manita we said if you want peace my son you should not criticize others rather criticize yourself if somebody is talking about you he is like that she is like that take it positively why they are telling like this there must be something wrong in me why can't I do like this it is better to do so that is the way we grow in spiritual life now I want these I want that in that way you can survive for few days and then you will die everything will be again the next life you have to start from the crashes so that is the spiritual life means accommodating and wherever you are whenever you are talking with people you are transforming their mind transforming their personalities helping them to grow to become a real genuine human being a devotee of God so thank you friends here the bhagavan's ramakrishna is the last word I'll read and then I conclude but one cannot succeed unless one renounces lost and gold only by the renunciation of ignorance destroyed so we will start from here again in the month of March uh so if there is any question today is asking are we people part of Maya everything or Peter everything is nothing but Maya so but we don't understand is as the children when they are playing with their dolls and they are thinking the doll is crying it is hungry it is afraid they are they are really really thinking that dolls are crying they are hungry and the dog that is chasing that doll that the whole world imaginary world a same thing is happening to us the grown-up people the same way but you don't understand that that is called the Maya una she has a three-part question first part is I do lot of prayers to him why God takes long time to fulfill them first question second part is I want to remove all other unnecessary thoughts from my mind and chant his name all the time what can I do to remove the unnecessary thoughts so this is a very wonderful question ah and first is the God will give you the answer now sometimes when we are praying do these do that we don't get the answer you know that is good for us that is good for us so that is the reason we should not be angry with God when I was very young I was very fond of the driver in the in a double decker vast driver so I wanted to become a double decker bus driver and I was not happy with God because he was not fulfilling my prayer then afterwards when I grew up I understood that was a wrong prayer is good that God didn't fulfill that then I started praying for something else that I should be like this and that that was also not then I understood after becoming a monk it was good that God didn't fulfill my desire so this is the way you know when you are growing in your life experiencing you will understand maybe some of your prayers are going to harm you if that is answered God the Father who loves you the mother who loves you that is why he is not fulfilling your prayer right this when the true prayer which will be beneficial for you surely will be answered by God for secondly it is a very good effort if you like to remove other thoughts but for that you have to be careful Association who are your friends who are your the people you have to survive with them live with them you cannot say no to them don't be alone at all that is a terrible life be with them at the same time go on praying to the mother please keep my mind at your feet hold my hand and take me to you and go on whenever you are free just go on chanting the name of God whenever you are having time read holy books listen to the Divine holy talks and when you are going to sleep particularly you read your holy book and think in that way and try to imagine that you are in the company of the Holy people this Rama krishnamah sarada and you are in that companion slowly you are sleeping by that way the your subconscious mind get all those ideas and the worldly thoughts will go away but it is a long practice please try thank you Sunita Banerjee is asking how do we stay quiet in the bad attitude from our neighbors that that you know this bhagavans ramakrishna said suppose the neighbors are unnecessarily provoking and creating problem then as a householder you have to hears you are not going to bite them or doing any harm to them but you have to show some way that you are not happy with them and if necessary you can also harm them so by that way they will be taken another space care and they will go away at the same time pray to takur fervently oh please change their mind change their attitude towards me why they can't understand me please change their mind and help me to be free from this problem this will also help you you will find their attitudes have been changed is asking when a person is in his or her spiritual journey he is God taking tests by creating more problems in his or her life by the help of Maya that is true or pita that is true this is not the more you are proceeding towards God the more the challenges more the hurdles that comes and one has to be very careful now suppose you are in the appearing in the class 10 exam then you are going to be The Graduate then you are going submit your paper uh what's called the going to be the PHD and you are submitting your thesis paper research paper are they not different the more you grow the more the challenges you have to be more cautious of course the God create in that way because he wants to see that we are successful there is a beautiful a poem by shami Vivekananda the cop and that was translated by the very famous writer you can read that they are the Vivekananda is telling that the dark drink of your The Brew is your fault and passion ages long ago Life After Life so many things we have done so obviously all that is there and we had to overcome that with the help of God through prayer and he there in one line he is mentioning I have said to your friend to come to me in a Rosy path but for you there will be the stones will cut your feet but don't stop come to me come to my bosom so that is the beautiful way the carp if you read he is mentioning that we should not stop our journey we should go towards God and constantly believing he is there waiting for me thank you Lakshmi is asking how do I deal with the overwhembling happiness after I have realized that God has been with me all throughout my life it makes me want to cry and laugh at the same time like an insane person do it that is wonderful wonderful that if you have realized God and if you feel that great joy and you must do it and you must do it in a sick secretly the people should not see but if you have truly truly realized and the people will know and people will respect you love you and they will give everything all that is in respect to you because God is like fire you cannot hide it when the fire is burning you cannot hide it the glow the world worms and everything that will attract the people's attention so if you have realized God the joy that you have found they keep it within yourself and wait and see what the God wants from you to to do whether keeping that within yourself or or to go out and show the People Help the people that one can realize God so wait and see and con be contented within yourself thank you shk is asking need to talk about saranagati others to Krishna please discuss if possible it helps me to remember Krishna my mind does not see Krishna please help me so it is if you love the Lord Krishna the Krishna you have to understand the philosophy of Krishna it is not that particularly image you know majority of the people they are loving that particular image but that image is an image but if you know him that that is why bhagavan's ramakrishna said again and again in Bengali Nama you are taking the holy name of a particular god or goddess and Guna kirtana Guna means the qualities of that God and God is if you know the quality of Lord Krishna which is all sacrifice and love and if you grow into that the unselfishness and the love then you will love Krishna truly and you will feel the presence of Lord Krishna within your heart you mom that is the teaching of Lord Krishna but majority of the people unknowingly I don't know why just they love Krishna but they say you should not come to me you don't belong to me and you are eating these so I should not talk to you they are constantly segregating themselves and becoming lonely when the Krishna is saying that one who can see me the Lord the Krishna present in all being all the time I belong to him so understand the philosophy understand the quality of the Lord Krishna why the Supreme Lord took that Krishna form and what was his contribution to maintain the Dharma the righteousness then all this problem will be solved and you will truly love Krishna gaurav Roy is asking according to yoga disease is an obstacle in the way of yoga does disease of does disease distract mind from yoga or is it an obstacle it is an obstacle of course because they are in the pain and all but suppose that and that Swami that I was mentioning he said if the disease is there mind doesn't go to the body so that is the main thing that is the main the suppose you are that disease is there your mind will not go to the body it will Spirit spiritual the aspirant for them not for the ordinary people the people who are having the body Consciousness mostly so when they are in disease they will the suffering they will be naturally they will like to develop their body and to cure their body that is a different and the spiritual aspirant also do that to take care of the body taking the medicine and all but at the same time it will be the wonderful that his body is not going to that worldly mindedness in that you have what they mean the worldly mindedness is not there as because the body is in pain rather it turns towards God God it is okay the body is in pain but even not the body I am not the body I am the mind I am not the mind also I am the Atman so that way if you are understanding and putting them whole mind at feet of God all the time that is good that's why this I quoted the the prayer of kunti MAA kunti so thank you friends and have a very good happy New Year and that is going to happen and we will be observing the new year as a kalpataru day it is that is the tradition of the ramakrishna order wish fulfilling treeing taru means the tree and kalpa means wish fulfilling the kalpatharu the imaginary maybe but the God is The
