[224: Panchama Veda 224 : Reading Is Not Knowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO-ddO70wRg)

good evening we will with the first class of this 2020 and today the date is also a unique zero three zero three two zero two zero very nicely so we will start this gospel of Ramakrishna and as usual we will chant from this mantra and we start to occur Tom return topped achieve and vividly written calm Masha struggle among Gotham three madam booby green and the Buddha dodging ah so that we started reading this gospel of Cyrano - nah and this is a almost a tradition in the Ramakrishna the followers at least one class should be there on the gospel of sahaja Schnurr so almost all the Centers of the than two societies they follow these so we have taken we keep this a read under the every Tuesday of every month second April 2013 we started reading the Gospel of Saddam additional and it was Tuesday so far we have started up to the page 587 of the gospel of ceramic dish now with the ceramic dish Nakata Morita which I always say as the function of Veda and topics that we have already covered least we can see who is God Pavan our God then Karim karma or the action then general at the reincarnation with the God width or we doubt for how to fix mind and God characteristic of a holy person what is Mukti liberation what is bhakti devotion what is Maya what is Brahman what is own God the best path for God realization in this age there is a small list of opening the selamat is not covered and we quoted from different Scripture and here we find that so only this many we can say that so many varieties way Saddam additional disguising us and what the part of God realization so that is the very important thing in the the gospel of see Ramakrishna he never sees anything else but God and he puts his in so many different ways something through song something through aims time to encoding from some somebody or sometime his own realization is explaining each and everything directing the mind towards the God so that is why the punch of evader we say in this way it is the Veda the knowledge that gives us knowledge and knowledge of what God now if we notice the uniqueness is around Krishna's life in the beginning of the gospel of course master Marche made him only the four years before of his passing away only the record the whole gospel is the record for years only and that is so much and in the beginning cinema Krishna say God realization is the goal of every human being and when he concluded his mission of desire to consume and as the first January 1886 he concluded by saying let you be illumined tomorrow Chariton evoke led all of you be illumined he didn't say the God realization because God the conception of the Hindus imagine lower than the conception of the Brahman and the consciousness so that is why he concluded you go up to that and be completely free so this is the ultimate now we will read a few pages and you'll read from the gospel of the ramakrishna page 587 and Serrano Krishna says it is one thing to learn about God from the scriptures and quite another to see him this is from where they will read one thing to know about God of the scripture where today I was just checking because now it is very most of the people are avoiding that flights so I had previously in the fixed that I have to visit New Jersey New York Connecticut or on that so I was thinking how to go so by god if we go how long it will take so then under naturally on the computer I saw from here to here to take this must our in the book please so easy but when you are on the road in the car that you were driving is so difficult so different completely different the 12 hours an hour to 12 hours morning 6 to evening 6 we can reach over them but no because they have to stop on the way after there are many many other things will come exactly that we set up businesses when you read about God about the self about the brahmana from the scripture is so easy and we reach that immediately we can realize God but when you try the moment you sit for meditation try to concentrate then you understand it is so difficult as I was explaining to the devotees this time see that baton team they gave in a very wonderful way the three stages jog-trot sadhna society and what is the solution that is the consciousness where I our mind goes and Marge's and obviously unknowingly we feel oh I had a wonderful dream less sleep and that sleeps gave me joy the two three things we find from here we may forgive my body when I forgive my mind when I March to that particular consciousness unwillingly which is to soothe the stage what is the result joy peace under satisfaction so this is the one thing and secondly when we try to reach over there consciously we sit for meditation and first thing we do try to forget our body and you will notice that the gurus they give you the instruction you must see you're the chosen item each today bata our TV sitting within your heart facing the direction that you are facing it's very peculiar when I am looking at the East so now I have to see that the God in my heart is also looking at the East how it is possible so I have to come out of my body to see the God sitting within my heart looking at the East where my face so I am forgetting my body coming out of the body the body consciousness of that body the limitation is over this is was the second is who is thinking I am thinking so mine the way I am thinking in the mind and slowly slowly marching into that supreme consciousness on which I am meditating concentrating and then I marches into that in the beginning the guru says that you should see that guru is merging with the eastern and second he says ultimately you're marching with the Houston so you are also becoming that God that means mind is have also gone so body then the mind goes what remains consciousness result joy peace please so this is the thing we have to understand that this is the way it goes that's why the Salam o Krishna is telling God actually come different and he says God is both inside and outside and it is he who dwells inside us therefore the beta says talk to him I see that means that tone means you or see you are God also outside therefore appears manifold through Maya but in reality he alone exist before describing the various names and forms of God one should say oh that sucked oh that sucked and sat means that is the eternal and changing that is you you the eternal the unchanging and you through the prism through the reflection through the Maya has become so many so this sometimes some people say oh gospel is so difficult to understand but if you have a little desert Shami we reckon the same apparently gospel is so easy but to understand the true true meaning the cinema Krishna said you must have to have the philosophical background and also the historical background social background so that you can relate what he meant so then practically the pedantic he pierced and he always said like this it is one thing to learn about God from the scripture and quite another to see him scripture only give hints it gives only hints search it on others and if we take it literally what is Brahman sat-chit-ananda the Birman becomes limited we have to understand that we cannot make the brahman limited because it is unlimited it is infinite it is everywhere and that which is infinite cannot be expressed through words but still without the words we won't have any conception of the particular thing that emeriti of the people they're happy with God the conception of God that we can understand that God took God as a human form and such and such date in that family and grew up in this way to modulator Ramachandra when we sing the song we imagine a little that child is moving around his mother chasing the child all these things which we know in the society but in reality what is drama and what is God so that is the reason the hint was given the form and also the avatar and then ultimately takes to that without fall so the mind is prepared to reach over there as a Salam o Krishna he is mentioning over there much better to bring to God in solitude the scripture only gives him therefore to read a great many scripture is not necessary he said that those who want to fight with the world they need that's why he used to inspired Swami Vivekananda Narendra not to read different scriptures and from different angle from different views so that he knew the sonoran the knot is going to be the teacher of the world and obviously he will have to face different questions he needed that but not all those who wants to realize God unnecessarily why they should read so many varieties of scriptures rather which say is much better to pray to God in solitude so Saddam additional here is giving stress and practice for whom the ordinary people who is not going to be the teacher of the world so further ordinary people like us he always says it is better you give your all - Brielle but when the prayer comes I cannot simply breathe I should have a faith unless and until I'm having a faith how can I pray to whom shall I pray what I am going to breathe and if I don't have the faith that my prayers will be answered can I pray now it is not possible just you go and stand and looking at the sky you can say oh god I am in trouble give me some help is it sometimes maybe but regularly you cannot do it you should have had to have a faith that there is something some power which is known as God or mother or father or Jehovah or Allah or Buddha then only L can breathe so that is the reason before prayer we should have to have faith and faith on whom whatever even if you like to pray to a tree that is also all right now if you know that the God is everywhere and he is also in this tree you can pray to tree that's why you will notice in the Hinduism they will pray before it tree they will pray before just a stone or they will pray standing inside the river they will pray looking at the sky or to the Sun so many varieties why because they know the God is or already God is everywhere what you need a faith that there is someone something which is consciousness which is present which listens to my prayer and has the capacity of the power to fulfill my dream to twin that is there we go and breathe the two different things happened first for the faithfuls those who have the faith it truly reaches to the year of God and second it gives you the inspiration somebody's listening to me and help is going to come so you are not frustrated you're not losing all hopes that is the by product of prayer in the prayer when you were praying you are hoping that someone somewhere listening to your prayer though I cannot see that he is there physically but I have a failed that it is there somewhere and listening to me and the reply of the result or the blessings of the help is going to come to me and we bring all my things are coming out I become completely free from there at least for something and I get the self-confidence oh something is going to happen enough to wait I should not lose hope that is also the great result of the player so he has Ramakrishna stirring it isn't necessary to read all the Bhagavad Gita here he is giving the stress on the specific thing don't waste your time just constantly reading the bhagavad-gita without understanding the meaning nothing is there in the bhagavad-gita sometimes and the most of the times we find that God said Chaitra sheiter young the all the shade that is world that you see is me but the lower part of me and who is the shade Raqqah me so what you should accept my creation army force Adama Krishna said a person waned and he saw a man is a tween wonder he is having only one container and one person is giving a white cloth and safe making black he just dipped it and gave the black thing make it you know the same water same liquid he is dipping it giving the urinal make it green same thing is happening he was did then ultimately when everybody left and the gentleman walks away you are waiting in here for a long time whatever color you want then he said I want you because if I get you I get all the colors you have that power to make all the colors from we do not know from where but I want you so that I get everything so when someone is going to God don't pray for little things rather you seek God I want to use and if you get God you get everything and that is a good Parker that is a good business and that is the good mind so go and say God I want realize you I want you you should be with me as Arjuna say to Krishna I want you not your creation not your power not your soldiers but I want to use so that is what ceramic is nurses the master went into an ecstatic mood while watching the evening worship Kali in the company of the devotees so when we see that the evening prayer is green on we only listen to the song and if it is a melodious so people enjoy and no effect of that spiritual experience what is the spiritual experience the when they are waving the light and if we feel oh you are the source of light you are the source of all this puncher that thing that we showed each and everything except you Oh God there is nothing so that is exactly when you think in that way your mind goes and merge it with that higher and all expanded consciousness you go into ecstasy the sadhana Krishna when he saw the Aarti the evening whisperer prayer is going on he went in to expect he was in no condition even to salute the image very carefully he returned to his room with the devotees and sat down he was still in an extracted moon he spoke to them while in that state in the room was early a young man about 20 years surveys who has a relative of the Mukherjee who was a relative of the mukajee's and very much devoted to the master he was married at the time he was living with the McCarthys and looking for a job master to hurry in an ecstatic mood take your initiation after getting your mother's permission - Priya referring to hurry I couldn't give him the mantra - I said I would initiate him I don't initiate people continue with your own meditation and Jabbar as you have been doing this is a another different type of situation so cinema Krishna is mentioning here the God himself wanted to help the man but there is something that the permission of the mother you know sometimes the mothers they don't understand but they think it is better not to go into all the trouble the mother's heart the ceramic person is saying take the permission of your mother but he wanted to leave the initiation think of it this is called Karma Allah so God wanted to give but still he cannot because in between God and the is a mother the affection are whatever it may be if the mother had given the permission he could have taken the initiation we don't know after what happened but this moment we can understand and we feel sorry for the boy though he was a good person who see Ramakrishna the god himself wanted to give the initiation to he could not date initiation and Priya he said he said he said continue with your own meditation and Jabbar as you have been doing he said master and I am saying this to you in this date of mine now the sentences the words that he said is really really wonderful and very very surprising believe my words you see there is no show or deceit here I just say to the divine mother in my ecstatic mood Oh mother made those who come here referring to himself through sincere attraction obtained perfection this exactly the sentence I quoted in the balloon world when they asked me to speak at the end of a speeches speech I gave that I told that these words cinema business ate those who will come with a sincere heart will get the perfection and what is this the perfectionist Rama T said this is the highest education education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man Swami Vivekananda and what is that perfection there's no desire when you are perfect the obviously then nothing left for you to attain when I am having something but still I know that I should have to go but there I should keep that and that is better than the disposition you are not perfect but fiction is that when you are completely satisfied then only after God realization a man can become hundred percent satisfied and then we know desire in the Punisher also it says after the realization of the brahmana not a small portion of the desire left completely satisfied if anyone else come and say hey you like to get this I have done this is a no that cannot be anything higher completely full so this is the Ramakrishna stealing whoever will come with the sincere heart over here and here means here means the I tell ology above and sanam Kista and what is the hydrologic McMahan ceramic dish then the God is everything hence you cannot hate anyone in any manner you cannot criticize so you see God in living beings you see God in that is the greatness of our our Krishna and what is the result of that when it can cool cultivate these the ultimately mind becomes fully love and that love is having no selfish desire so unselfishness and pure love that is the ultimate of surround isness bath and no person of eighteen others no question of criticizing others now pushed left with even others nothing so that is what cinema Krishna Oh mother made those who come here referring to himself true sincere attraction obtained perfection some of the time some young American boys were coming and they're curious to know the Eastern religion they go to put these and they go to different other paths and also the varieties of Hinduism then ultimately they come over here and to give satisfaction I read the pages a few pages of the gospel of Salaam Krishna and I get my answer so if that is that many different parts of the world many people have the contact hours they say we are so satisfied when you read the gospel of Salaam distant because the satisfaction comes when you get the truth and just before that he said I am saying this to you in the state of my mind believe my words there is not sure or deceit here there is not sure deceit here was a telling saddam additional who could not say I mine was so free even then unfortunate the people think oh there are many other things about so Derek income is so close that's why in one time the Swami Vivekananda he saved the wind of Ganga is flowing some people ignored and blind they are digging well by the side of the Ganga come by himself is there full of pure water but they don't understand that to get some water they're dealing almost on the bank of the Ganga unnecessarily wasting their energy so this we have to understand Mahendru Kobayashi of City was seated on the verandah conversing with the Rambla Vetrov and others the master called to him from his room in the master marsha the recorder wind out quickly and brought Mahindra in master to my Indra sit down and listen to my words through the kindness of God the Mahindra he himself was going on talking some people at the habit of going on showing that how much they know and here the master ceramic dish nur is so kind he didn't left him alone he didn't call the hot rod as Raja is a character when you read to the salon business this is a character he leaps so close to God but could not understand God sometimes used to think that Sonam Edition is great but then again is to forget about that and if we are doing not only that he'll be criticizing selfishness and he used to insist people not to go to me that is terrible and as from amoeba can they sail so this new movement has come the God has come in the form of RAM Tichenor and the new movement which is going to help the world the people if you help this movement you're blessed and if you are trying to disturb this movement you will get the cars of God that's the only time shall make me waken under give this caution don't try to disturb this movement if you can't help if you don't like just go ahead but don't try to disturb this movement we have seen the young boy who was loved by our revered president mother's detained President Barzani joined and he was a bright young person he secured very good marks and exam then afterwards he came to America and all those things but some reason he became a critic of the Ramakrishna Vivekananda he started criticizing publishing book and developing a group of people some people are very good in negative things so they also joined him and in the beginning people started thinking oh he is going to disturb the whole ramakrishna mission nothing happened and person is new and now completely frustrated here and there is going on thinking it's a completely wasted he got the opportunity but he misunderstood it white eagle there's no little thing that destroyed the whole effort so this Ramakrishna he is asking this minder and to come he was a caveat the respected person God can be served in different ways sit down and listen mind words and the master Marche is recording noticing mind there was a little embarrassed but he sat down then see now Krishna to the devotees God can be served in different ways on ecstatic love of God enjoys in in different ways still he is mentioning some time he says Oh God you were the Lotus and I am the peel there is a relation between the God and the devotee the B cannot survive without the honey of the Lotus or the the flowers and flower needs the bees to come so that it can take the flowers hand and spread everywhere so that the relation between the God and the devotee so devotee and Reuben do not take her in one of his song his point he is mentioning also like that had I not been here as a devotee where you had been God as because I am here you are there so that is a beautiful evening or the song he mentioned him in different ways sometimes in Oh God you are the Lotus I am the Biel and sometimes you are the ocean of satchitananda and I am the fish so I am always within you and without you I cannot survive so that is the main idea the ocean and the fish means the fish cannot survive without water and God is dead in which we are all surviving you are the ocean of the children then have the fish some time again the lover of courses and your dancing girl she dances and sings before him he thinks of himself sometimes as a friend of God sometimes as his handmaid and he looks at God sometimes as a child as the Yashoda and sometimes as husband are sweeter as deep the gopis so this way in different paths different emotions that we are already having a human being is having different every emotion all those emotions we are directing towards God and whichever emotion is very strong I take God in there to something sometimes the ladies the mothers they think God has their own child so they'll be taking care of the child so they'll be making dresses different oh now the winter is approaching we need to cover the car they will be meeting the straighter for God so that is the love and you cannot feel when they are meeting for the beloved one there this will be the size and this will be the nice way treating people will appreciate not that all people can do it some people those who are having that attitude they really enjoy meeting those things and they're meeting for God and sometimes I have seen they're making small small shops and gloves for God so that is the way they love and sometimes Balarama looked on Krishna as a friend sometimes you think yours Krishna's umbrella or carpet he served Krishna in all possible ways but this is the love I should not give any discomfort to my god all the time which described some people when they come and see it and talk inside the shrine so we feel bad why because the God is here if you have that idea the presence of God we cannot talk we cannot discuss something else we should go somewhere else and then do in under man when us there people used to come and they'll be bringing the daily newspaper and at when the special puja is going on they'll be reading the daily newspaper they are not devotees in Andaman there is not much thing to do so this to come and these to get other people were to socializing and at that time when the puja is going on other people are singing bhajan he thought this is the time I can read the newspaper then one day I told self why you were reading the newspaper here what is the wonder that I cannot go out so I will to lysing my time and if I don't you close the newspaper and chant with me sing with me or ask question when I am describing something get involve into this and you will get much more job newspaper is always there it is your newspaper you can carry anywhere you can breathe but these type of things you won't get anywhere else so what a journey so slowly slowly I used to request them not to read the newspaper over there so this is the way what Slama busines hinting at his own state of mind while thus describing the different attitude of a lover of God next he described tightness true spiritual moves saddam additional master children they used to experience three moves in the inmost mood he would be absorbed in samadhi unconscious of the outer world this is the in most ultimate then in the semi conscious road few dancing ecstasy but could not talk and in the conscious mood she would sing the glories of God when someone is singing the glories of God that the at the last that is the only the last third grade but sometimes people after meditation you also must have failed after a deep meditation when you get up you know feel like talking meeting people because the joy that is coming from within you try to release that child it like to continue that joy so that is the second same would and think about the children know ma Prabhu but the ultimate used to forget about himself so meditation means forgetting about ourselves the spiritual meditation means going and marching in the spirit which is all-pervading consciousness not that I go into sleep but rather exactly opposite I entered into the consciousness and there the feeling of joy the feeling of please fearlessness because you find yourself everywhere and there is no question of you and he or she there is nothing difference to what happened the feeling of oneness that the only one is there and nothing else and that gives you completely of I am such the sons of T of I am that the word that he had used the word Gita the 16 chapter Avaya means no fear it's not the sometime some very fearless people are there they are ready to go and three some difficulties not like that this is not the worldly thing is the fear fearlessness because complete identification with the oneness and seems there is no do there is no fear so this what cinema businesses Jatin Lamarr Prabhu in that final stage is to mix in their second human being looking at the people but won't filled talking because his mind was redrawn and third used to sing at the regard to the devotee you are listening to my words now he is explaining try to assimilate them look at it a once Rama Krishna himself is telling you will listening to my words try to assimilate them to practice them with worldly people sit before asado for the time being they completely hide all worldly tars and ideas but once away from the holy man they lift them out again you have seen a vision eating dried peas you think he has digested them but he kept them in his you can feel them there this is the worldly thoughts are already there so you can feel a task put aside all duties and pray to God one is reminded of him by Curtis what is that the evening approaches what should be the feeling one more day is - from my total counting days may be that I am having 80 years or 90 years 100 years but one day is over so that is it's not that a long life is good not like that but active and conscious life that is the main thing living like sometimes a picture will come a lady or a gentleman somewhere in the world they're living 116 years 20 years god bless them but the thing is just like living like that what is getting up in the morning and then just opening my eyes sitting over there but the whole day eating something already seen and out there then in the again goes on like that now that is the life one should leave thinking of God and maybe a short life but very fruitful life so that exactly what the Shankar Acharya smothered wanted there is a story when the Lord Shiva they were praying Shankar's parents Adi Shankaracharya mission the Shiva told okay I will give you the blessings he will get son but what type of son long life but useless all the short period of life but very effective so that not only your son but the whole world benefited by his knowledge then the break they prayed for that short-lived but very spiritually effective life the Shankar lived less the ancient orgy Jupiter also Jesus you also a pretty short life shall we be vague and not even 40 so like that that those are the lives leave sharp part that whole life should be a light for the others so this is the way how it is possible by developing spiritual consciousness and how we can develop the spiritual consciousness right assimilating the teachings of ants around Krishna so he is mentioning you are listening to my words we have already read up to the 588 wages so many fries ways Salameh Tichenor gave us the idea of God and now he is telling you have listened now try to assimilate them and worldly people they come the subdued their thoughts the listen but afterwards their worldly thoughts are so powerful that that will take out all those which he learned at a task you must breathe who has brought about this change you must think the Muslims put all side all activities and say this real at the appointed time that Ramakrishna appreciated appreciated the continuous effort to do so sometimes the Hindus you'll find that in the train earlier travelling and the Hindus they never do anything then all the time either they're watching the movies in the flight or asking for some food I did sort of like that it went on but I really watched when I was coming this time from Abu Dhabi when we were flying a young Muslim gentleman he was having a little small baby girl and she became ready for all everyone was looking at her she was running running around talking to people looking at the people at that that young father I was trying to go to the washroom I found that he is praying in the plane itself as they always to spreading a small bat he is praying in their own fashion and that time the announcement was going on that you must go to the but he quickly he was finishing and the lady she was watching carefully that he should not heart himself and praying but he was free I'm seeing a man who my god I should also do like that it came the Muslims they are really very very devoted that ceramic is not appreciated the dis activities the Muslims put aside all activities and say their prayers at the appointed times five times that do the Mukherjee revered said is it good to practice japa today only one young boy wrote to me somebody has told them if you do japa that is bad you should not do job this company variety is a gurus out there and they are so eager to confuse others so then I wrote back to the Japan but be careful when it needs to be careful like crossing the road or driving the car and that time we should be careful otherwise whenever this possibility do the Japan Japan Japan so and Siddha masters Ramakrishna's replies yes one attains God true Japan we should conclude so that we can take this message of sri ramakrishna with us today one attains God to Java what is the job silent repetition of the Holy Name of God silent repetition of the Holy Name of God better when received wrong a guru who has practiced it for a long time what happened because as because it distant so that gives it power and unwillingly you are getting the heck facility this already is leaving and sometimes some people will bring a seat and then they will show and then they will take care and slowly the sprout will come out that is one way but sometimes you get already grown up small saplings and that is so easy to maintain the this getting the name holy name or the initiation or the mantra diksha from a guru means you are getting the saplings this is already grown up so you need not to be so careful about it it is already there now only go on giving little water into it and what is that water taking that name that's all and it helps a lot immediately it goes on growing growing and growing and helping so this is Ramakrishna say when someone I don't know whether the young boy who wrote to me today and I reply not to refute this before I applied today if he is listening this dog he must read this page 588 of the gospel of Salaam Tichenor so it says revered sir Mukherjee is asking is it good to practice Java and replies yes one attains God through Java thank you and we will continue in the next week lettuce forever belong to the god needin journey [Music] down gumpa Drita be grumpy yah Vitara [Music] but a Misha medium Tom Ramakrishna asana Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti Hari you that start sri ramakrishna our eponymous too
