[318. Panchama Veda 318: “All cannot understand an Incarnation of God.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE9OrnvzRpE)

namaskar dear devotees and friends uh this evening we will be discussing about the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavad-gita let us begin with this mantra [Music] discussion was going on incarnation incarnation of god and girish chandra ghosh she was arguing with another writer and a very famous man in those days trilokia so trilobu he was talking in a different way now bhagavan siram krishna interrupted and he said why do you argue with such so much is asking to girish why do you argue so much they busy themselves with both now this line we should be careful we should pay attention to this line they are discussing about the incarnation of god and now girish wants to prove that there is the incarnation of god god can take the human form trey lucky has the doubt and he also includes so other people and they like to make the same line equally with the incarnation of god that is the main dispute now bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning they busy themselves with both the world and god and not practicing to realize god not practicing spiritual austerity to realize god no busy keeping themselves busy and passing time majority of the people they do like that so that is the reason we don't see the change in the attitude of that person in the behavior of that person in his character there is no changes more and more they are doing like that more they are becoming worldly type of people arguing trying to prove themselves writing books publishing articles trying to prove himself like this they go on but that is exactly opposite should be the god realized people because world and the god and when you go towards god we always give away the word but this is very clear now bhagavan sirama krishna indicating that that they busy themselves with both the world and god now he said one cannot understand the joy of god unless one has tested it now we get joy in name fame popularity prosperity and everything we get joy of course we get joy but that worldly joy is temporary but we think that is sufficient that is the main problem when we are satisfied with that and we think this is the only thing my grandfather also used to have like this my father also tried for this i am also doing the same thing what is the wrong so this is the way it always goes but when they think no i must realize god and god realization and the joy of god realization these are the things that we must understand otherwise it is impossible so they are thinking that swama krishna is mentioning one cannot understand the joy of god unless one has tasted it then he said worldly people talk about god only from hearsay worldly people talk about god only from hearsay yes it means just to talk about god like that and we always encounter you always experience we always see the people those who have not practiced anything they always talk a very in a lengthy way they will be talking like because they feel joy in that they think oh why not let us give some uh the opinion about the god and all this so that is the ramakrishna's observation about the worldly people he is telling like this worldly people talk about god only from hearsay but they that doesn't matter i don't blame such people can all comprehend the indivisible saccidananda don't blame those people it is not possible for all to understand satchi ananda that is brahman can anyone comprehend that majority of the people if they have some some property some house some wealth some popularity some acceptance in the society they're very happy and they will be going on telling oh these are the things that we have achieved in god and all that i met one person who was so proud to show that he has achieved some social recognition he's a monk and i know swami ranganathan ananda ji maharaj who was the last or the president of the ramakrishna order this ranganathan and the maharaja i heard that the government of india wanted to give him the highest of the respect bharat ratna and he refused that he told no i cannot keep that bharat ratna before my name and if i don't mention bharatnam before my name it will be an insult to my country to my motherland but if i put that then it will be an insult to my guru who has given me swami ranganathan should be the first so i miss the master so i am a monk i don't need that so if you really like to respect me listen to my talk try to imbibe those ideas implement those ideas for the betterment of the poverty-stricken people uneducated people upraised people served them so that was his idea then true monk should speak in that spirit if the monks are also going for craving for the property craving for the name fame political power and all the social recognition what is the difference then that means they are thinking that they are going towards god but in reality they are not it is exactly opposite what the monks that do they serve the people when you give the classes when you give the talk when you meet people when you publish the magazine only object is to aware majority of the people about their divine qualities that is already in them the morality that is there they should have that otherwise it is not possible they should manifest that morality that is the main idea but the other people they don't care about that if that this we have to understand now this is only very lower level and think about incarnation of god so bhagavan sirama krishna said i don't blame such people can all comprehend the indivisible saccidananda only 12 rishis could recognize ramachandra friends if we see the growth of hinduism we'll understand how slowly and very carefully they have introduced the highest philosophical thought in the masses and given to the society ramachandra immediately after the satya yuga the god is taking human form satya yuga the truth has already been discovered majority of the people they were having the satik quality good quality helping each other and always contemplative always satisfied with whatever they have that was the satya yuga not that all of them but majority of them so that was the satta yuga people were happy that the rulers were just and rishis they were all engaging themselves to discover the truth that is in the nature and they were also very careful to discover the easiest path by following which the ordinary people also will be able to understand the joy of liberty the joy of liberation from the bondage of the maya so all these in satya yuga now population was increasing and the people they were living in a different way there was a group of people they were highly cultured people they were the rishis they were the monies they were mostly living in a secluded places and they had their schools then the young people is to go to them to learn about that and different type of researches were going on the society human society was establishing so bhagavan came at that time in the form of sri rama chandra but he didn't say anything about this incarnation of god at that time why people were not ready ordinary people were not ready the munis there were so many hundreds and thousands of munis they were they were researching the different things including the spiritual life only four twelve of them according to bhagavan si ramakrishna only 12 of them they understood when i was reading the bhagavata then i found that one after another the sri ramajandra meeting the munis and sutiksna muni he was waiting for sri ramajandra he was realized soul and he was about to give up his body but he was waiting for sridhamachandra to come srirama chandra hartley 14 15 years young man and he was banished and he was going into the forest how come muni knew okay maybe that news prayed it muni also came to know then when the muni came he said i am supposed to leave my body but i told that i won't go until i see sri ramachandra why because all through my life i have practiced austerity to realize the brahman and when that brahman has taken human form how wonderful it will be won't they see that that was the shuttikshna muni so he knew that he is that parama brahma and should the brahma-parath-pararam afterwards when they composed about sri rama chandra who is this ramachandra should the brahma he was the pure brahman and that should the brahma he has taken the human form afterwards people accepted because the mind was ready to understand that but at that time only a few munis twelve of them they understood that but they didn't disclose because other people won't understand rather they will think what is this a human can we are worshiping him as god then came the krishna after srirama the satya dwapara then dwapara sri krishna came he wanted to tell people that it is possible the god can take the human form because that consciousness who has created the whole universe can't it take uniform and why human the hindus the traditional hindus they believe that in different time and different form the god too sometimes a huge fish to save the the world as a huge bow so to save the world every time he is helping the human the to saving them and that was the way the god was taking the incarnation like the fish like the animal and and slowly slowly slowly a dwarf a human but at the same time short then came the full sri ramachandra etc so those who believe they believe but if you see that slow development and slowly slowly it comes to the complete that sri ramachandra and then krishna and krishna is showing lot of miracles varieties of miracles even then the people could not accept him as the incarnation of god rather majority of them they thought that it is all magical power this person is having some magical power look at it minds were not ready when sri krishna came as an ambassador of the pandavas and he wanted to plead that give the five brothers only five villagers and they are not going to challenge you you enjoy the whole huge property this whole wealth you take only give five villages to the five brothers you know the the story of the mahabharata but that time the other group they wanted to arrest him they thought he has come over here on behalf of the pandavas now if we can arrest him he won't be able to go and give them all this information moreover he was very intelligent he is guiding them we can stop that also the pandavas won't get the very good friend and guide at that time also sri krishna showed that huge form bisharupa darshana the word that they used bishwa rupa darshana he showed that the whole universe he is belonging he is the vishnu he is the main creator now what was the reaction if you only bidura then bhisma and osama only few all others they started thinking oh he is showing the miracle this person is having the tremendous power to show the miracle is all miraculous thing they never believed him as incarnation so bhagavan srama krishna is mentioning all cannot recognize an incarnation of god some take him for an ordinary man some for holy person and only a few recognize him as an incarnation friends i was giving the class on the bhagavata and there in the bhagavata when i was reading that all this the great war was over and duryodhana and the group all they were killed pandavas the the they became the kings particularly yudhisthira the elder son he became the king but yudhisthira though he was constantly getting the company of krishna he was in the company of lord krishna he was advised so many times in so many different way the krishna saved him in so many times even then he could not accept him as god why because he was thinking it is not possible krishna is one of our relatives and he is a very intelligent person really very courageous person is a very good politician and that much and he is guiding us he was having respect for krishna i respect for krishna as bhagavan sirama krishna is telling sometimes the holy man they used to die he is also very holy man he said but the yudhisthira when going on lamenting oh i have committed sin oh i have committed sin i have killed so many people only for little this the krishna the lord the god he was guiding them asking them urging them that you must fight this war because to establish the dharma righteousness good people should always win and bad people should be destroyed the good quality and bad quality the bad quality should be ableist destroyed so lord the god he was siding the panchapandava both the good and bad that all came from the god and god is always inspiring us to be on the in the good side of the good and judish tira who is highly respected because of his calmness and also a pious person he was always truthful but even then yudhisthira could not understand that krishna is an incarnation arjuna saw the krishna showed him that he is actually holding everything everything that is happening because of him arjuna saw that moment he said yes yes yes yes all this delusion now it has gone and i have realized i have realized that you are the god then afterwards again he forgot he had the respect great love for krishna but at the same time never could 100 percent accept that he is an incarnation so if you read the mahabharat if you read the bhagavata you will find then everything was over the krishna saved the uttara sun uttra was pregnant and uttara failed that someone is trying to harm and then the she came running to krishna not too har the the you know they were also very powerful the pancha pandavas her husband was killed but they were there pandavas were there but not to arjuna not to judiciary not to vemma not nin she never prayed to them she was praying to krishna why these young ladies she understood it is the lord god who can save my son because then the krishna immediately understood that they're very you know they are trying to kill the fortress the baby was still in in the body of that uttara this is the first time the lord entered into a human body every time lord only created through maya eva but this is the first time bhagavata is going on telling people that this is the first time because god loves his devotees so much and when they cry and beg for help god cannot restrain himself he entered into the person of the lady and then saved that parikshith afterwards the great king now this is the lord krishna the panchapanda could not understand him and all those people they could not understand him that he is the incarnation of god and who understood friends if possible please read the bhagavata and there it says that from the book 1 skanda 1 8th chapter from 17 to 42 almost these 25 slokas the verses rani kunti the queen kunti mother kunti she's praising krishna when everything was over krishna was getting ready to go back to dwarka he was boarding in that chariot then the kunti came and started and he started all the 25 verses began with the 17 and he started with namaste purusam tua adam isharam look at it the krishna was his nephew brother's son and krishna was the age of arjuna naturally kunti was elderly lady but that kunti now she recognized the krishna she knew but this time she is disclosing when all people gathered over there to see of the lord krishna who was leaving for dwarka that time before everyone kunti is praising and praying to the lord krishna and started namaste purusam tua aatyam isharam and if she goes on she said i bow down before you who is the controller of everything ishwaram issuer is the master of everything and then says who is pure consciousness beyond illusion prakriti param purusam purusam has a consciousness beyond prakriti illusion or maya and that consciousness which is beyond maya who resides outside and also inside of all being look at the realization of that lady we never heard we never read that the mother kunti went for practicing spiritual austerity no she didn't practice any yoga she was practicing her swadharma even when the history her children she was constantly going on practice practicing the spirituality while residing in her in-laws house her husband's house her husband died and then she continued living over there very limited time she was with her children vancha pandava the pandu's children and she was there when the war was there at say or that time also she was in the camp of the duryodhana and living with duryodhana's parents not that all the time they were liking it even she said no as a widow i am supposed to live in the house of my husband now you'll continue sloadharma only through sadharma she got that power that she could recognize krishna as a supreme lord the bhagavan sirama krishna mentioned it is very difficult all cannot recognize an incarnation of god why they live just like very ordinary people very very ordinary people so they cannot the people cannot understand that kunti understood why i am mentioning this the important thing is the kunti and the just the ordinary lady of course she was very intelligent she was very courageous she because of the the queen of that great family she had their heart education everything was there but when she practice spirituality and to understand the incarnation of god one has to have the purity of mind so by practicing swadharma i am the mother i am the wife i belong to this family i must be here to looking after all this thing but without any attachment she was living in the household of the duryodhana who was trying to kill her children but he she never blamed ru yodhana she never went and prayed to dru yodana only she was waiting whatever the gods will let be done calm and composed and going on spending our time dedicating and to serve this family but without any attachment so this is the main thing if we can learn to serve god without attachment anywhere any work in any level any walks of life one can realize god so that is kunti's life and she is going on telling and she is telling that who resides outside and inside of all being who is beyond the reach of human senses al-aqsa the 17th verse alaksham that we cannot understand why because it is beyond our senses how can that i was telling some people computer can say anything nowadays google is the greatest guru of everyone anything that you say ask google immediately google will be able to ask about the medicine google will give the answer ask about politics google will give the answer ask about the road and the places there now google knows everything this is the now the new coinage the i googled when i searched in the air so that's all coming but can google tell the who are the software developers no why because that has not been fed to that machine google is a machine very highly intelligent machine and who created it another qualified person and if that person is not feeding giving the data about himself or herself google won't be able to tell anything about that creator similarly the creator of this universe who is god he has given so much of intellect to the human being but didn't give that information and to give that information he took the help of two one himself taking the human form living with the human people growing up with the human people and then guiding them look at me i was also born like you i also grew up like you i was also facing so many troubles like you i am also having so many other things just like you but even then i know everything you know how because i am not addressed to those that is the only thing non-attachment attachment non-attachment the moment one can develop that though it's very difficult because it's the god's maya and we can understand god's maya is so difficult and we have to go beyond that and suramar krishna is telling it is possible the mother kunti recognized krishna as god but the others could not and she is concluding three krishna bhagavan namaste she's addressing krishna her nephew a very young man than her comparing with her age bhagavan as the god namaste i i bow down to you so these 25 verses are very important because recognition a realization understanding of god in human form that is krishna another person was also understanding now again if you continue you will find that the yudhisthira he came to sri krishna and wanted to know something about the political thing the how to rule the country this that krishna told see why you are asking me there is another person over there waiting that is bhisma it's a great personality and he only will die when he wishes still there why don't you go to him big the advice is from him and when they went over there what the vishwa said he looked at the krishna and said i know god you are so kind i was going on praying the i will only die when my ishta devata my chosen ideal my god will be standing before me otherwise i won't die so now you have understood that time has come the best time to die uttarayana dakshinayana all these hindus the traditional hindus they believe it so this is the time i should die and look at it you have come to me yudhisthira he is accompanying krishna he is coming but judishida couldn't understand these but bhisma understood so friends if we even live with the abutara we may not understand that very recently on the bank of the ganga bhagavan sri ramakrishna who is the embodiment of rama and krishna both he himself declared he is the lord vishnu now so many different incidents that proves that if someone don't believe don't believe that is the what to do doubting thomases they will be like that but those who believe that they know sadama krishna and look at it when the gospel that we are reading the writer of the gospel the composer of the gospel he was just like another going on writing the conversation the shortened writer like that this person went with another friend and that friend was say swara but we don't find the sidhu visiting second time he is the person the siddeshwar the friend the sidhu he took this master mahashay to suramar krishna he also saw the living god but looked that unfortunate he never could understand that and that is the reason he never visited god second time almost so far my my knowledge goes he never visited that so this is the way we should understand that it is not for all the who can understand if the mind is completely free from the worldly attachment worldly objects worldly desires that's called purification of the mind pure mind then only one can understand it otherwise not the bhagavad-gita krishna is mentioning that it is not everybody one can understand all cannot recognize an incarnation of god some take him for an ordinary man some for a holy person and only a few recognize him as an incarnation and this is very very rare very very rare some people will be telling oh we cannot accept dharma krishna because he was worshiping goddess kali i don't believe kali so he was worshipping kali so i don't believe sriram krishna look at it and because they are not having any purity of mind the purity of mind will immediately understand another pure so we will continue and we will find how bhagavan sirama krishna in a very unique way teaching us who can actually understand the supreme god he said like this a rich man said to his servant take this diamond to the market and let me know how different people price it and he said that take it fast first of all to the eggplant sailor servant took the diamond to the eggplant sailor he examined it turning it over in the palm of his hand and said brother i can give you nine shades of eggplant for it the diamond and the eggplant sailor his idea goes into that he never saw the diamond he doesn't know the diamond so he could not understand the cost of diamond so he is telling well i can give you nine sale nine kg and what is the eggplant there hardly a fourth thing one kg maybe one hardly at that much and that means that little money and he is telling that much i can give otherwise not and he examined it turning it over his hand then he said brother i can give you nine seeds of eggplant for it friend said the servant a little more say ten shade the eggplants seller replied no no i have already quoted above the market price you may give it to me if you price the price shoots you the servant laughed he went back to the master and said so look at it servant knew how costly it is and he was trying to give a chance to that man and he's so ignorant that there are people the worldly people they will never understand the purity they're so engrossed into that and when they see their bank balance so so many hundred thousand are there so happy oh so many hundred thousand are there next day you'll pass and that where the money will go because he has not kept any will and he was not ready to share it with anyone what will happen to it it'll go to the society equal to the god the bank itself or the government i don't know according to the rule it will be there he himself could not utilize it and he never could give it to other people for their development so the he could not understand then he went to and he said the servant laughed he went back to his master and said sir he would give me only nine shades of eggplants and not one more he said he had offered more than the market price the master smiled and said now take it to the cloth dealer the other man deals only in eggplants what does this he knows about the diamond the cloth dealer has a little more capital let us see how much he offers for it the servant went to the cloth dealer and said will you buy this how much will you pay for that the merchant said yes here's a good thing i can make a nice uh jewelry out of it i will give you 900 rupees for it 900 rupees brother said the servant offer a little more and i will sell it to you give it at least thousand rupees the cloth dealer said friend don't praise me for more i have offered more than the market price i cannot give a rupee more laughing the servant returned to his master and said he won't give a rupee more than 900. he too said he had quoted above the market price the master said with a laugh now take it to a jeweler let us see what he has to say the servant went to a jeweler the jeweler glanced at the diamond and said at once i will give you 100 000 rupees for it then look at it so that is the reason sometimes some people when they oh what he ate oh this he ate so he is not a religious man what he wore or this clothing or he is not a religious man these the way they always judge they're like the eggplant uh the sailor or the cloth sailor they don't know the cost cost away the grand diamond so by this way bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning the majority of the people they do not understand we should not blame them it is their unfortunate they do not but one should be very very careful how it is possible again and again the our shri shankara shankaracharya he is mentioning in the vibe that you have to purify your mind and what is the impurity selfishness and how the selfishness come because of the ego and ego covered the whole thing i know all this i have read this book i have heard those things by that way the mind is always covered so we cannot open up and see wonderful thing that is there and this is what bhagavan si rama she always says whatever you know it is okay and try to listen to others also and if possible imbibe some of the good qualities from them too and slowly slowly one thing you must know in the spiritual life the spiritual life is only meant for god and not for the creation of god the god has created this universe and in this universe there are so many things are there if you want anything from it you can get it of course immediately you will get it the god will be so happy to give you but not the knowledge of the truth we find this picture in the upanishad also qatar punisher many of you know that young the nachiketa the three boons he got from the king of death the first one the second one then they himself said hey nachiketa ask for the third one wanted to know about the atman the self he said some people say it is there some people say it is not o king of death you know it because you are standing in between the life and death you are the standing on the threshold of this too so tell me the truth immediately he started telling you are a young man what you are going to do with this knowledge you better take all this thing enjoy i will make you a great king and you will have the sons and the grandsons each of them will live hundred years so naturally your life is will be long and this will that well going on tempting he wanted to give the world and nochiketa said no i want knowledge so if we want to understand the incarnation of god we have to understand by giving up our ego otherwise it is very difficult to understand bhagavan sirama krishna he never showed any miracles but those who understand the wonderful way of god will understand wonderful miracles that he has shown to the people among his disciples there was one who was from bihar he never knew even a single later but he became a brahmagyani in the company of sri ramakrishna and by the blessings of krishna he changed everything slowly slowly everything is getting changed so friends this is the thing that we must understand slowly people are understanding different religious groups are understanding these different societies their understanding all paths are leading to the same goal which he declared in the modern time it was discovered by the rishis of the world and in the rig veda very clearly mentioned and that was practiced and propounded by bhagavan si ramakrishna but he lived so humbly he was not wearing even the geruba cloth and he was living in a room where he used to live and lie on a bed and used to sometimes wear at the cover his feet with some shoes and people will be criticizing oh what type of sadhu is this only a simple shoe and they know now god cannot so this is these are just like the eggplant sailors they can't understand now let us conclude the incarnation of god belonged to the class of the ishara cotes and they here it says is continue they talk of practicing religion in the world suppose a man is shut up in a room all the doors and windows are closed only a little light comes through a hole in the ceiling can he see the sun with that roof over him over his head no he cannot see the sun that means he only see the small little hole suramar krishna is indicating someone saw a light a little light and they are overwhelmed with that thinking oh that is the great realization but it is the reflected light of the sun but they have not seen the sun why because they are buddhi their intellect their realization was shrouded covered as he is telling everything was closed so they could not see and what will he do with only the ray of light lost and gold is the roof can he see the sun unless he removes the roof lost and gold again and against ramakrishna is mentioning the desire for the worldly enjoyment and obviously these people won't be able to realize god the worldly people are the shut up are shut up in a room as it were what is who are those worldly people all no i have seen many people the devotees that they always follow the righteous path to when the children are grown up then they will limit themselves and every moment every time the beautiful routine they follow and they will be serving the holy people they will visit the holy places they will give a little donation as much as possible for them and they will be taking the holy name of god they'll be reading and they'll be always trying to be in the company of the holy people by that way they are making their mind purified at the very end of your life if you can do that then all the things that you have already done in the past all are washed up are cleaned up bhagavan sinam krishna said the if you are bathing an elephant and living it free immediately again he will go and take the dust and throw on its body but if you bathe the elephant and diet then it will remain clean the same way when we whatever we have done in this world because we many of us majority of us after the education got the job our money settled down as a householder the children grew up whatever the responsibility as the parents we have done we all practiced our the helped our elderly parents also so we have done whatever was necessary swa dharma like the mother kunti then why those people should not realize god now the only thing as the lord mother kunti she when they offered the mother the panchapandava the mother now is you are the mother of the the king that remain over here and enjoy she told no my children look at that they are going away i have to look after them both of them can't see somebody should be there to serve them no attachment for enjoyment the last and goal lost and gold lost and world as the bhagavatam krishna is telling again and again it is like this there's no attachment and the kunti left with them the same way bhagavan is telling if that is gone then immediately your mind will be purified and you will see the whole sun the incarnation of god belong to the class of the ishwara cortes you know that there is another discussion the ishwara koti the different jivas and this then some people they're trying to be mumuk shoes they're trying to get liberation to some of us like that but the ishirakarti they are completely free right from the beginning so to just comparing like that ishwara kurtis are the very holy people they took the human form or different names and forms to help others so they are free but still they are going over there to help others like the teachers the teachers are already passed from the school but still they go to the classroom just like other students not to learn but to teach so the teachers they also go to the school they also go to the classroom they also follow the routine but they are not students they are not bound by that rule they are free so ishara kotis are just like that they also take the human form they also take birth they also grow up like us they also live in the society behave like any other people but they are not bound by the cravings desires because they have come to teach us to show us that if you want eternal joy eternal happiness the peace you have to be completely detached you perform everything but detached yourself that is exactly what is the teaching of the ishwara kurtis and sudama krishna is mentioning the incarnations of god are just like that it is the god himself it's not the jivas that slowly they purified themselves and risked to that height of israeli as the god himself they're also completely free no bondage but still they calm because if they don't if they are not showing then the people won't be able to go towards the path of liberation they will grow up in the darkness of birth and death why desire desire desire the me many millions and millions of people they are thinking they are practicing religion but they do not understand this little thing that if you have the desire in mind then there is no way to get the liberation the to teach that they come the bhagavan krishna also in the bhagavad-gita is telling i don't have any responsibility in this world but still i come and work if i don't do this the people will never understand they never learn and they will suffer they are my best creator my creation my best creation the human being so the lord is taking this form to help us they roam about in the open space they are never imprisoned in the world never entangled by it their ego is not ego of the worldly people the ego the eye consciousness of worldly people is like four walls of a roof but the man inside them cannot see anything outside the ego of the incarnations and the other isharkotis is a thin ego through it they have and they have an inter inter interrupted version of god take the case of a man who stands by your wall on both sides of which there are meadows stretching to infinity if there is a hole in the wall through it he can see everything on the other side if the hole is a big one he can even pass through it the ego of the incarnations and the other circuits is like the wall with a hole through though they are remaining on the side of the wall still they can see the endless meadow of the other side that is to say though they have a human body they are always united with god again if they will they can pass through the big hole to the other side and remain in samadhi and if the hole is big enough they can go through it and come back again that is to say though established in samadhi they can again descend to the worldly plane the devotees listen breathlessly to these words about the mystery of divine incarnation bhagavan's ramakrishna is to go to that samadhi again and again but again he will come back it is so difficult to have the samadhi once in life and for suramar krishna it was as regular practice every time whenever he wanted rather he used to pray to the divine mother to keep his mind in the lower plain of this world so that he can talk to the people friends try to understand this is sri ramakrishna apparently you look at the picture just a very ordinary person bare body from the village very very ordinary but he is the supreme god how you know that because of his life if you look at his life there is no ego there is no selfishness there is
