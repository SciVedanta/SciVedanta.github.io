[47. Panchama Veda 47: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0kQl9TtDBw)

it is begin tabu khatam rhythm dr. G venom kobe v rhythm calm asha pom surana mangalam srimad autumn booby Goonan de bourrée dodgin ah the last time we have read and discussed that keshavjee under Shane she took a boat motorized boat to Calcutta from Calcutta to dictionary and ceramic ISNA board came up to Calcutta and different type of question answer discussion where every religious person goes what he does this through the discussion through the talk he wants to give the spiritual religious enlightenment knowledge ceramic ishness life all through everywhere we find this and now the another chapter is beginning the writers master Mahesh I mindin our Gupta he is mentioning the master with the Brahma devotees part 1 here he is mentioned that the semi annual conference is going on for the Brahma devotees and Saddam o Krishna is going over there and when he reached over there all devotees received him respectfully salam o Krishna is talking talking with them suddenly he saw sheep not ship nut Shastri he also became a famous preacher in Brahmo Samaj he was a very large net man and you know the Shastri is a title of Sanskrit those who are having that different type of knowledge in Sanskrit language Sanskrit literature and grammar they get this type of certificates titles the ship not shastri the master cried out joyously ah here is ship not so many devotees were there suddenly when he saw the ship not he was very happy and he is expressing and expressing in his own beautiful way he's telling you see you are a devotee of God the very sight of you gladdens my heart this notice those words you are devotees of God the very sight of you gladdens my heart when every devotee is entering into the temple and offering pranaam to God not only the devotee is receiving the blessings and happiness God is also happy that is the reason the people are supposed to go to Temple because God is sitting over there manifested over there God is everywhere but at the same time in the temple in the shrines where we are constantly meditating on God praying to him chanting his name reading about him discussing about him there the manifest addition is more and that is the reason inside the temple one should not read other books should not discuss the politics and other things so that is the reason because the environment and the moment you enter you feel that because God is very happy when he sees the devotee is not only that he saw the devote ship not and he was happy when every devotee is coming he is happy the very sight of you gladdens my art then as he's always he is giving an example one him smoker feels very happy to meet another very often they embrace each other in an exuberance of joy one person who is has the habit of smoking the him and all that alone when he is smoking he is not happy when he finds that another person they're very happy they didn't get the company though when the people are drinking they also like to get the company so that they can discuss and afterwards of course when they are fully drunk the fight but usually they are very happy when they see the frame and they feel he that was Ramakrishna is telling when a devotee seeing another devotee they're feeling happy afterwards he is telling the differences between people so many people are coming to God so many people are coming to the temple but they are different sometimes I find that the devotees of God are accompanied by what less people their companions are immersed in gross worldliness and don't injure spiritual talk at all since the devotees keep on for a long time talking with me about God the others become Restless finding it impossible to sit there any longer they whisper to their friends when shall we be going how long will you stay here can you imagine we are here we are trying to get the blessings of God and when the God Himself manifested in the form of bhagavan sri ramakrishna dear in his company before his presence there riskless they like to go every and afterwards he will describe and weíll also quote from the wahoo bhagavad-gita why these different type of people and he is asking then the devotee says wait a bit we shall go after a little while then the worldly people say in a disgusted tone well then you can talk we shall wait for you in the boat all laughing they cannot appear the presence of holiness this is very peculiar once raghavan see Rama Krishna and his disciple Shami bremen and that time ramananda g was a very young boy both of them they went to a server and after the meal they were given a room where the event for rest the moment see Ramakrishna stepped into that room he stopped and he looked in a corner to a corner of the room and then said ok I am going away and Oxford Rakhal to come along with him they will leave he was a young man after eating he wanted to sleep and he was not finding it good why should he leave right now and there is a bed he's there we can take rest then stahma Krishna after was narrated have you not seen those spirits they were in the corner of the room and when I entered they were tormented and they were asking me begging please go away because we cannot stand your company as the light the moment you put on the light darkness cannot leave similarly the holiness the purity the moment it entered into some place there the impure minds cannot be right so they want to go away look at it who is explaining God himself so this we have to understand the devotee see which beat the worldly people will never listen to you if you ask them to renounce everything the way you are asking them to renounce they are not at all at all happy the one person was telling me the they were having a very rich earth relative and the relative was donating here and there to the political people mainly then this person told why don't you donate a little to that asama because they are in depth and they can you can help them because you were sufficiently reach he said what the ostomy is going to do to me if I give this money to the political people I get in return so many other things from them what the summer will do so this type of temperament mentality thinking are also there and God is not liking it again he is telling the god or the divine people what do they do they like somehow to tell people to utter the name of God nitai nicht ananda mahaprabhu and chaitanya they're the same he used to go and tell people the name of God has very great sanctity it may not produce an immediate result but one day it must be a fruit but that is the reason people that take initiation diksha there's a month and here we find that the chaitanya mahaprabhu are bengals six hundred years before ceramic ISNA he came and he is telling these the name of God has very great sanctity now some people will say but we don't find it we are repeating I have repeated for the whole month nothing has happened now he is telling you cannot get the result immediately but eat beard the fruit to someday now he is giving an example it is like a seed that has been left on the corner of a building after many many days the house crumbles and the seed falls and the art jan minutes and at last beers fruit so when you are taking the name of god that is the japan thing we don't find that immediate action is there nothing is there when we SAT to take the name of God when you got up to after that we as the same person so why we're doing it some people they'll be telling oh no it's not no use just mechanically we are doing it is not having barring any fruits is of no use no wrong because it goes goes goes deep down into ourselves and someday it will chairman it so that is why this different type of people as worldly people are endued with sattva Raja and Tomas so also the bhakti that rise by the three gunas that this is the wonderful discovery we can say of the Indian Saints and sages they are finding out that route why the people are different why the behave differently why everything is so different though the maybe they are the children of the same parents they got up in the same environment they are brought up in the same environment why then they are different then see Ramakrishna is talking about the satwa do you know what worldly person in dude etcetera is like then about the Rajas then about Thomas he is mentioning we know that in the bhagavad-gita 18 chapter eighteenth sloka there also Raghavan Sri Krishna he is mentioning Ghanem IAM por aqui oughtta trivita karma to Donna Karan on karma car t.t travail de karma Sam graha look how they are explaining Ghanim means knowledge gium object of knowledge Parigi otta the north for every knowledge there must be three things and first is the person who is trying to know that is ghanem and object of knowledge and the pari Giada the Noah Noah who is the person of the student the devotee he wants to get that knowledge what knowledge whatever may be in our case for the devotees it is the god it is the art man it is the Brahman it is the self so we want to know the cell who mean and how that is the knowledge the knowledge of that thing will come to us and how it will be corona karma and kartha instrument of action Geronimo that is our in Rio's our senses so with the five sense organs we are trying to get some knowledge and knowledge of infinite though it is limited finite trying to understand infinite with the help of dis indriyas and kurt 80 karma many purpose of action we go to Temple we go to God we go to churches we pray there is a purpose surely for a purpose we go and what is that purpose that we have to ask ourselves why we go to temples where you go to churches we never ask that question to ourselves why I am going over there sometime recite scene we go over there just to see I went to Canada and the capital of Canada there is a very big church is there and I went to see that the huge charge I didn't go there to pray I went to see the construction and the building the arrangement just as a tourist I went over there then of course i SAT and prayed but my purpose was only to visit the if I go over there as a tourist only to visit will I get the blessings that is the question I am going just for the fun of it shall I get the blessings you have to have the mind ready Cara Nome the instrument of action all the in Rio's and your mind should be ready to receive their knowledge and that is why bhagavan sri ramakrishna again and again he is telling and that is called the spirituality unless and until your mind is ready until then unless all your inner ears and senses are trained to receive that knowledge to receive that ghana to receive that blessings you won't get it so many of the people will be coming over here out of curiosity what is this as a huge building what is this 10 this is a library this is this thing are this is a shrine why so many gods curiosity they come they see they go and they forget but sometime I have seen in the noontime some of the devotees will come and sit over here looking at the photo intently praying no one is there he or she is not here only to show other people that I am a devotee I am a holy person no quietly coming over here sitting over here looking at the photo and praying not that there she is known to us unknown interior kept up God SAT over here I saw so these are the devotee coming only for the purpose to get the blessings of God pray that is the reason that we have to understand the Quran um that is the instrument and then the Karma action the action is more important and when you go to the Hindu temple there are so many functions are going on we are so happy to see that so many other people are also there hi hello we are men just exchanging and of course going and bound down to the gods and goddesses coming out what is the purpose are you ready with all your senses to receive the blessings that is the Christian the development in spiritual life this is the question are you really sincere in that case in the bhagavad-gita so many thousands of years before they are giving us this training ghanim Gampa ricotta gannam is the knowledge gium the object of knowledge and body guate the person who wants to know these are the three and they do the whole thing so and how you will do it if you're envious senses including your mind already then curran um all the instrument then the Karma purpose of action Ronnie rush money the she is the founder of the dictionary temple and she was a queen very rich lay lady and very courageous also she festive his fought with the British years in those days so he very courageous lady she came to dictionary and pray to see Ramakrishna it only ordinary priest and as an employee of the Rani Queen she SAT over there and requested the ceramic esna can you please seeing a devotional song ceramic ishness started singing then suddenly stopped singing and give a slab can you under that situation when you imagine it is so scary we don't hesitation a very ordinary I think eight rupees she used to get as a salary from that lady the malkin in Hindi may get there she was the owner of the whole thing give his lap everybody was taken aback and they were taken they were ready to take action I've said then the Ronnie told no don't do anything he is correct why I was thinking something else sitting here were here I asked him to sing about the mother and he was singing what is the purpose of the song too well up the devotion instead of that I was thinking the litigation that is going on what will happen how our lawyer will present it all those things i forgot the purpose of visiting the temple taku very kindly brought my mind back to the purpose so that is purpose of action the india's the qur'an am karma and the kurta raghavan see Ramakrishna when he was a very young boy he was accompanying a group of ladies they were going to a pilgrimage in the center place Bashar lakshi vishal means huge all-pervading lucky up she means the eye that is god goddess so there is on the open field there's a big stone is there just like I so ago still now the villages the go of course they have covered it with a temple etc when he was going accompanying the elderly ladies all the ladies were gossiping something except about God none of them they were talking about God or doing anything so just to bring their mind back to the purpose what is the purpose you were going over there if you like to have this type of talk the gossip the conversation you can very well see it over here and do that why you were going to the temple to the pilgrim centre what is the purpose so that young boy Avatara whose light mission is to spread the religion to bring back the religion in the minds of the devotees make them understand what is true spirituality what he did you know those who have read the back of your thigh Ramakrishna he fainted as he fainted and then they were they were trying to bring him back to consciousness sprinkling the water fannying calling nothing happened suddenly one lady started taking the name of God and he got up so that is the teaching training see Ramakrishna's give what's Adama Krishna is teaching these think that we have to remember again and again the part purse if you don't feel it's of not isn't necessary to go to the temple but if you really feel you must go to temple with the purpose most of the time we come to the temple and there is also a society so many other people are there we become friends we become enemies we criticize we praise we make the groupings everywhere it is there and temples are also not out of this that is a sad thing because we forget the purpose karana the instrument of action karma the purpose of action and the courtesy the Carthage a'n't these three should be tuned trivita karma Samaha and from these constituents of action all the actions that is happening only for these then in the bhagavad-gita in different places they are giving a details about the Roger a tama and chateaux the knowledge dominated by satwa how we will know that we are Spock te kura jessica temasek is giving the list the knowledge dominated by satwa leads to understanding of unity in diversity the very first thing unity in diversity the moment we think oh no they are different we are different they speak in a different tongue and we different their culture is different we are different you are not a sub thick so see this is our very clear if you want to be a sarthak you have to develop these qualities no differences why all the manifestation of God so this difference should not be there the person whose knowledge gianna thinking dominated by satwa leads to understanding of unity in diversity then what will be his action action dominated by it the satwa into detachment and freedom from passionate affiliation what will be his action thus attic he will be doing it a very intently but unattached so that is the then they adore dominated by it is comparatively free from ego sins not completely free from ego it's not possible only after these when you realize God then the ego will go but here the ego is I am the child of God the Son of God I am the servant of god I'm the friend of God that hero is there then comparatively free from saints ii go saints and attachment but yet does not lack enthusiasm and interest in the work bhagavan sri ramakrishna a simple word he saved see when a devotee see another devotee he is very happy why both of them are going to God and what is God nothing but unselfish love pure love so that is the reason they can love each other they can feel for each other the moment you are adding some purpose with it worldly purposes then you were gone a very rich person is coming immediately it is different I came over here I saw my god such a rich person he's here so it started coming and then slowly slowly making a friendship with that man so that I can influence him so that I can get some benefit you are not at their hoodie so deal I must love that person also and the person who has nothing to help me even then I like him because he loves God he is coming to my taco coming to my god so that way there so the doer dominated by is it completely comparatively not complete comparatively free from ego sense and attachment but yet does not lack enthusiasm and interest in the work the moment we think of that we are detached we stopped working wrong when you go to some other places and we see Don necessary the fans are moving lights are on unnecessary the only expenditure we put it off not that we wait for someone to tell us now this is a my tacos thing I must take care so that this should not be any wasted when I see that the chairs are scattered here and there and I go and I seat and when I stand up immediately I have to keep those things properly because who else will do it why should I have to give travel to others look at it this consciousness always alert why this is my gods players and wherever I go is nothing but the manifestation of God and if a person is coming and doing the job that ID undid it so obviously i am creating problem for that person i should not do that the when you joined in the Asama the first teaching that we received from the senior choix me we used to go out for marketing as a brahmacari we we had to do all those things and he said when you are going for the marketing is a long journey and there is a osama there if you like to take Prashad you must inform them at least three hours before the cooking our cooking would be over by 10 1030 11 because they will be offering to God so naturally before 10 1030 so they know these are the people coming accordingly they will the provisions they will it relies and you must reach their right time before food don't tell them keep that food and somebody should wait for me I am coming you have to wait no don't create problem for the astana so that Islamic eva that you must always remember that is called shot to a luna very simple thing but that creates the supt wah and then the intelligence dominated by the supt wah or is accompanied by moral sensibility and the eye to the spiritual side of things I to the spiritual side of things and moral sensibility and that is the reason the subtle always we talk we know about it we know the three gunas almost all Indians are aware if it at least those the generation the older generation the senior generation they know about it but actually what 18 chapter of the Bhagavad Gita it gives the details and if we practice that we become spiritual and nothing else we need not to go to anything any person only these qualities that the accompanied by the what intelligence the booty always should think what is moral what is good that we should do otherwise not and this way and the strength of mind dominated by the Satwa is expressed as control of the senses and the mind so first what is this Trust is the Satwa leads to knowledge of Satwa leads to understanding of unity in diversity and we see in the life of sri ramakrishna is the manifestation of the Satwa and Beyond satwa everything is mingling in him all knowledge are going to him all experiences all that is the beauty of ceramic ISNA then we find as a strict adherence to principles and experience dominated by the supt wah in the beginning it is painful when we are experiencing practicing satwa painful because it is high moral value because you have to discipline your mind and which is very difficult but at the end is a great please if I practice the sattva-guna what I get naturally there is a question and what I will get after practicing sattva-guna then it says is so difficult in the beginning but at the end it is blissful and the Rajah gunas its direct attention to the diversity of things and not their unity the Rajah guna people their first knowledge will be diversity and not unity we went to a temple they are having lot many rooms some of our devotees they wanted a room to practice only twice in a month did it practice reading gospel and ceramic ashna exit Exeter then the gentleman he came and said I am sorry only those who believe in my god are allowed here otherwise not he is a Hindu so not on 20 but he told you may be Hindu but I don't believe you I only believe that those who are practicing the my path believing my god they are allowed over here we're from it is comin Raja guna I have understood so that is the best whatever I think I do all a perfect and best it comes from ego the knowledge dominated by Rajas direct attention to diversity of things and not their unity and the work dominated by Raja result in actions done with great attachment egotism and tremendous energy they will show the energy you will do the good things but with attachment and for the name and fame they will never do silently quietly the octagoon is nobody will know who is doing it long back after the passing of a vagabond see Rama Krishna who asked his principal disciple Prince a Swami Vivekananda that you were the leader you must keep your friends together and then they hired a haunted house because the other houses were costly so hundred how's that 28 rupees in those in a trapeze was really costly and the ground floor was full with snakes and other dirty things only on the first floor and that was the way there is to leave no food that there was a big tamarind tree when there is nothing to eat Swami Yogananda G who was the son of a very rich landlord the landlord of the arch in Asia he used to go to pick up some tamarind leaves millions of lives are there even then the caretaker is to come and scold him and to call him as a thief why you are touching the tree this is one somehow used to bring used to boil that you can try I have not tried I don't think that is how it will taste and used to boil that without any salt without anything that used to make one one ball and a direct disciples did to eat that that was their condition day and night meditation reading japa discussion they never cared about the body that is called baranagar days very highly austere days was going on then suddenly you started finding always there is some rice little bit of oil some salt some vegetables and the deal it is over next day again it is there and these two wonder how it is coming yesterday it was almost empty the container of the rise it was empty again it is full who is doing it you know who is to do it after a long long time they discovered it was master ma cherie sorry mom used to go and meditate along with them and secretly he will go and see check in the kitchen area what are the things are there he was a very ordinary teacher is to earn a very less money in those days the salary was not very high even then he is to bring all these provisions and keep over there people who are not doing who is doing it for so long in my life also i experienced I was in a Himalayan ass trauma and I loved to take coffee or tea coffee was not a available there in that is a poor Asuma but these two give me the tea so I had a flask and I used to bring the tea nice to think if I could get some biscuits would have been better because in the ten o'clock 11 o'clock as to feel hungry and I was thinking the very fast day and from the Assam IT was not possible I opened the gate I found a very good biscuit packet is hanging outside the door I thought maybe somebody's they have come kept it over here they will take I didn't touch and it was there for the next day also then I thought if somebody has given to me let me so I prayed to taco if I am taking away somebody's please forgive me but I am hungry I like to take it the day I completed next to another packet is hanging it was next to another packet is hanging I was there for one month I till now I do not know who is to supply the biscuit packets now there are some people they will be constantly helping in this way very secretly but there are some businessmen we'll be telling gupta Donna in Hindi they say Gupta Donna's secret donation even the Lord Jesus is also telling your left hand should not know what your right hand is doing etcetera but the in the name of Gupta Donna they are giving Gupta money actually the black money they are donating that is not Gupta Donna the sum of the hundies they will be putting lot of money particularly in the South Indian temples they say I don't know i don't have any expert direct experience but that is not cooked organic up to donna means you are helping without knowing know people don't know who is actually doing so this is the way the knowledge of the Rajas is direct and then they cannot see unity you always see the diversity the actions with the great egotism and the agent dominated by eat is greedy grill at us to subject to elation and depression subject to joy and sorrow that is the now the intelligence of the Rogers dominated by it is riddled with confusion about the right and wrong what is right and what is wrong constantly and has little sense of duty Rogers the strength dominated by Rogers is under the sway of ambition desire and worldly status and the happiness dominated by Rajas is extremely attractive in the beginning when they start doing something they are very happy but the end of those actions suffering see now the question is the scripture is only telling you the truth whether you accept it or not whether we accept it or not to us and those who will understand it accept it practice it they will be slowly going towards God elevating towards the spiritual realm so hard is coming Tomas and the knowledge dominated by Thomas sees mere side issues at the whole truth because some of the people is always critic they can never understand what is the problem the one gentleman can claim as a devotee he came in he was the interred saw me and the can I talk to you and yes why your these things are not like this year you're good I'll have you gone to the shrine and I'll go afterwards I like to know all that fast you go to the shrine then came first you ask to the God why is all this then perhaps he will answer and if he cannot then I'll try I was joking little even I could see how many people we found it where nobody is the air nobody is attending the door and we'll that is the reason there is one person 83 another 73 another 60 who is going to open the gate now come and be here give you some services can you do that come and do that give your service and if it is a God's home it is your home why don't you come and do that so the thomas i am not criticizing but we see the people and from then we learn that i should not be like this the temasek people also is a great teacher what should we learn from him that I never should do like this they cannot see the whole thing the only side issue of the whole truth who is telling this shri krishna it's not me it's not anyone else shri krishna raghavan Sam and doggedly hold to hold on to them without you thought under the prompting of passions what is their knowledge this is the knowledge and whatever they will hold you cannot change it doggedly they'll be holding it go on arguing with them they will never change and result will come to the result of the words they are also practicing spirituality about whom the these are talked about the devotee but this devotee they are coming to God but unfortunately not knowing that he or she has to change the characteristics of his thought his action behavior now these people action dominated by the Thomas the Wayne the temasek people is taking some action is undertaking thoughtlessly there will be doing the same thing thoughtlessly all the people they assembled in the house of God then one person he said oh we have been attacked our religion has been attacked our God has been defined by some people just take the name of God and don't waste your time in the corner of the temple there are all souls and sticks and gowns and our arms at the active take those things and go and attack them as many people you can kill so directly we will go to heaven and some of us we believe in there and we are excited some mom we take the name of God and run and pick up a sword or something and go and kill the innocent people maybe they were not knowing anything and we feel that we have done something very good really thomas 'ok this temasek people they action dominated by thomas undertake thoughtlessly without any estimate of one's capacity of resources what he actually can do and is prompted by delusion and grill more teen so this is also very very important there is sometimes some people out of emotion one of our Swamiji he was a very young they somehow he brought from the street one person lip rosy person and he was taking inside the room I mean what you can't mean now I like to do all the saber to that lip rosy person we are not supposed to do that over here we do not know how to do that if you want to help him taking to the hospital admitting over there collect some fun give it to the hospital let him get the proper medical medicine doctors will look after him how you can do that now how you can talk like that being among you cannot he was fighting so this is totally is it not servicing emotion we have to understand how far we can do how much we can do all the thing we cannot do that you have to understand so this is the reason that Thomas undertake thoughtlessly without any estimate of one's capacity of resources and is prompted by delusion and grill motive the agent the person who is a thomas 'ok dominated by the thomas is fickle minded you'll be doing these in between that sometime here sometime there is a fickle minded and then exploiting procrastinating slip and his and his met haar and intelligence dominated by the thomas is seeing unrighteousness as righteousness because he is in a delusion so his intellect sees only unrighteousness as a righteousness so this is all these things strength of determination dominated by thomas is always up subject to depression this temasek people after completing their work that depressed so we have to be very very careful so we the devotees of God after attending all our duties responsibilities we are coming to coming over here to increase to develop our spiritual life that we should not forget I do not come over here to please someone no I do not come over here only to engage myself no I come over here to develop my spiritual knowledge so when I am walking I am cleaning and working all that thing should be go on with the repetition of God's name and the first time raghavan see ramakrishna quoting chaitanya mahaprabhu the name of God has the tremendous power to clean your all work and thoughts pleaser dominated by Thomas is the from the beginning and lethargy and heedlessness he cannot reach anywhere so this is what is the teaching of Raghavan see Ramakrishna today he only is mentioning to Brahma devotees so he could say like these no he is telling the truth to them it may not be very palatable they may not like all these things all people want to listen only praise but when the god they come they don't bother about whether you are liking or not they tell the truth the mothers they always tell the child seat for it for your study you must be concentrating on your study don't waste your time the sometimes the children do not like the mothers because they are constantly trying to say their fathers because only after the office you will come hey son what you are doing let us go for a fun and Sun is very happy see the father never asked me to sit and read but you were constantly asking me because mother is concerned to the shastra the Avatara the guru are just like the mother very compassionate very careful alert to help us the Vagabond see Ramakrishna he has come to attend a function and after coming over here he is telling them you know there are some people they are swathi some people are rajasic some people are Thomas sick similarly bhakti devotion has a shot and we will read in our next class the bhakti also having a subtour a giant ama a devotion is very pure but even then it has that so that is totally different type we will read the next class let us complete need an janam medium anantara bum popped a new compa Drita bikram by ye chaahat arum para Misha medium tamarama krishnam sheer asana mama oh shanthi shanthi shanthi hurry he owned that said sweet hama Krishna eponymous to
