and the Punjab aveda the gospel of serum kishna Tabaka Tom rhythm dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma shop ahom shravana mangalam srimad additem boo Bakunin te buried our Jana last time in our last lecture we were discussing that ramakrishna he was talking about different type of yoga hatha yoga raja yoga mantra yoga layer yoga ghana yoga bhakti-yoga karma yoga kriya yoga so all these so many varieties of yoga so many varieties of ways to reach to God to be associated with God so that was and then we also discussed about the different chacras different blades different places of the yogic places like mooladhara swadisthana moneyball on Arthur we should add cachaca and sahasra today he is today actually that the Sarah there's a wonderful almost the same way to our timing also but it was friday jun 15 1883 i'm reading from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna page 2 45 46 it was a holiday on account of the Hindu religious festival then obviously so many people came and the conversation was going on all the devotees were coming the people who are coming to see Ramakrishna they are asking different questions and he is giving the answer now today one gentleman was asking can one realize God while leading the life of a householder is a very important question very very pertinent all sir so can one realize God while leading the life of a householder and cinema Krishna with a smile he is telling why not leave in the world like a mudfish that is and wonderful example he is giving worldly things Means War what is this world me and mine it is me and mine and that is the causes of bondage that is the causes of suffering now if one can understand that why I am suffering not only in this life also the lives that will come afterwards then what is the cause if it is suffering what is the cause that to find out the cause we find that is the bondage it is the attachment so that if we can manage salam o Krishna is telling why not leave like leaving the world like a mudfish unstained this is very important the mudfish living in the mod but the moment it is coming out there is no mod so unstained while we are living in the world we have to live in that way to unstained what is that stain that is attachment the moment I am thinking that this is the place or the things that I am doing we doubt me no one can do before me and after me no one should do be able to do so that people will remember me this type of psychology hundred-person in the human being and that is the cause of suffering recently I was reading an article in the published in Indian paper whether the Barack Obama will miss his in and the president's plane is a spatial plane so obviously after a few months he is going to be retired somebody else will come he will then use that flight is clean and will miss it so they were the article on that the human Association he was knowing that this doesn't belong to me but for the period of his presidentship obviously he was using that started thinking that this is mine started developing attachment to that and that caused the problem so this is what Sri Ramakrishna is telling do your duties in the world fixing your mind on god mom a new samara you dodje in the bhagavad-gita sir Krishna say to Krishna long long back mom Anoosh mother think of me you touch ur s Ramakrishnan is selling only leaving the world but Krishna is telling you the job then you go and fight fighting is a terrible thing killing people and also protecting oneself so that way mom Anu Samara remembering me that is the secret of service karma yoga what is the Karma Yoga we talk about Karma Yoga true karma through action by performing duties one can realize God one need not to meditate one need not to go to temple or church or mosque one need not to do any other things except remembering God and the divinity constantly every moment and working this one of the direct disciples of bhagavan sri ramakrishna Shami brahmananda gee he is giving a very practical instruction now the problem is people are not serious about spirit jollity people are not serious about God realization they want some something that will stimulate them they go and then they will be singing the budget they will be jumping dancing spend thousands of people will be there and they think this is religion that may be but primary level very very primary level if you go to a school where only the kindergarten is there what do they do all shouting jumping moving from one classroom to another classroom then going to the play all these things are going on children are drawing and to a painting so many other things are there only beginning there is not education education is deep pondering education is the capacity to take decision education is the capacity to understand sir tility this education and that is the beginning only similarly in spiritual life when we are doing all those things that is also religion but very very beginning and here see ramakrishna is giving the excellent instruction but very few understand this where if you are interested to take it but that is the only thing that can save us from the suffering of this world what is this what Sri Krishna said long back in the bhagavad-gita mom anoos merrihew durga similarly this our brahmananda G is telling just by analyzing and expanding the instruction of Sri Ramakrishna when you are going to your office she was talking with some people who are working in the office when you go to job keep a photo of Bakugan see Ramakrishna in the drawer or maybe in your wallet maybe in your pocket take it out just before starting the job before starting the work take it out of photo of Saddam occasional look at him pray to him this is my puja this is my worship please accept and do whatever you are doing no changes nothing then afterwards a teacher or an engineer or a tebow the doctor whatever may be the profession in between if you get a recess then again take out that photo and again you see that photo and pray to Him and keep it only one or two seconds that's all but your mind is going back and getting a test mom anoos murah you'd Thatcher practice in the presence of God as a famous book what is that practice is this thing presence of God means constantly remembering God that's why the Hindus have developed the system of diksha mantra diksha they take the mantra from the Guru and go on repeating repeating repeating repeating why from a guru because that tradition the coming the same name of God but after practicing and realizing the truth that is coming down one after another through the parampara through the succession of the disciples and the children so that is the way it goes so this is important why mana not write a as we are going on repeating repeating repeating that helps us today one gentleman American gentleman he was asking how to meditate so you are discussing about that what is the purpose of meditation that is the main thing purpose of meditation to get peace happiness and in the in all situation all environment all position tranquility keeping the tranquility so that is how we can do that we can do that by taking the name of God repeatedly so see Ramakrishna is pointing out the craving for worldly things which is chronic in persons there is no into the craving barsana barsana in sanskrit they call the craving desire desired is that one after another desire one desire is fulfilled another comes up that is fulfilled and the council there is no end to it that's why the karma is a symbol is the wavy water the waves never stop it goes on and on and on if somebody is standing at the sore of F ocean and thinking that when it will stop then I will go and bed in the water of the ocean he can never do that because it's not going to stop so continuously the waves of the waves of desire is coming so this desire is the problem for our we're from the desires are coming association when we are associated with something the moment we see we hear we start thinking about that and that Association brings us many many other things that's why in the in the householders life they were very much careful about the character of the tendon all the tendencies of a man and oh man a girl and a boy so that their tendencies should be the same or otherwise all this problem if someone is thinking it is ok we need this is sufficient and another is going on thinking no I need these I need dad and going on pestering over that and to get that extra work extra money and forgetting the god the purpose of life and then after some time he finds you can never satisfy by getting all this thing so the cravings Ramakrishna stealing the craving of the worldly things which is a cron and there is no end to this craving the world things because it passes away today I purchase them TV and after a few years again a new brand has come so naturally I want to give away that one and new after some year again new again new there is no into it same thing with each and everything of the worldly thing one cannot think of God unless one leaves in solitude see Ramakrishna he is stirring there what is the way say one cannot think of God unless one leaves in solitude so their discussion can one realize God while leading a life of a householder then ceramic esna answers why not leave in the world like a mudfish and then he says do your duties in the world fixing your mind on god but this is extremely difficult do your duties in the world fixing your mind on god but this is difficult that also warning is giving this is really very difficult then he says why it is difficult because the craving for the worldly things which is chronic and one cannot think of God unless one leaves in solitude there's a wonderful the conclusion one has to go must have to go in solitude what is this solitude now in the Shiva shamita we find Lord Shiva he is talking with Parvati and he is telling that jetty that jetty Sangha sarahbeth hearted G Ebrahim anata nan lavi bakhtin satyam satyam my old item this Lord Shiva is telling emphasizing the solitude give up as otherwise there is no chance of liberation now last two this friday saturday sunday there was a spiritual retreat was going on and that was discussion was the brahmin what is that brahman our own reality and when you go back to the reality what happens liberation liberation from what liberation from what what is the bondage kona mabunda khatami Shamar gotta so this is a question we're from the bondage comes what is the bondhus desire we're from the desire comes association in the bhagavad-gita we fine sangha sangha atacama now goes on on and on step by step when we are having the association a situation of a person association of Athene association of a place then the desire comes sang god sanjay atacama then comet grotal variety wherever there is a desire and if the desire is not fulfilled the next type of mind is closer anger so see how the wonderfully there and they have analyzed the human mind we talk about God we talk about spirituality we talk about Brotherhood most of the people without knowing the basic of the religion they talk about that and that is the reason no one in real happiness and that is the calls ease the Shanga what is the Shanga people have lot of other things they are ready to do except the solitude they do not like to go even if they go to in the solitude there also they will add disqus about the worldly things in the life of avanza ramakrishna we find that he is going with one of his very close disciple he was a the landlord is a rich man mathura Babu and the mature garwood took him to a place very holy place that is our car she been ours in English they also called the kashi the Benares and in Banaras also the mathura we invited some of other landlords their friends they were sitting over there discussing about the cost of the properties cost of any other things they were discussing about the business what type of thing we should purchase what is going low so that we can purchase and keep it and then sell in a higher price salam o Krishna he was beating his head and told mother when you have brought me is this holy place and in this place people are supposed to think about Shiva Shiva is the personification of renunciation tiada and we are thinking about the worldly things and why you have brought me over here I don't want this association i was happy induction ation now it depends on the house since here we are Lord Shiva is telling agitated jetty Sangha so the Sangha means Association Association of a person who is constantly thinking and talking and behaving very oddly way he cannot think of anything else and if you are having the association of that person know it for sure he starts will influence your mind to and when you go to the movies association when you read a book that is also talking about this worldly things association but if we are reading a very holy book like the gospel of ceramic Krishna of the Bhagavad Gita or the bhagavata then the venetians data situation is constantly inspiring to be disassociated two things at their worldly spiritual one is world and the spiritual the world is temporary and God and the spirituality is permanent if we go to the God and spirituality peace happiness joy if we go to the world things a little bit of joy in the beginning then lot of trouble comes constantly again and again it comes like that so that is called Sheba is telling giveaway giveaway giver be and the Krishna also told giveaway sungard Sanjaya the gamma gamma crudo variety growth authority some more and from the anger builder pneus comes we forget everything all judgment goes and we start thinking this is the thing I must do what up comes let it come he forgives that after doing that he'll be suffering then makes him mad like thing sangar sanjay tacoma comet crudo variety grew the authority some more some more hearts pretty big drama all the past the teachings advisors that his CD / gates Smith even shot Buddha Naja what is the booty the decisive factor a capacity of mine nice shy art macabre de they decide they take the decision that is called with D that is also gone and then he plows and he files and suffering suffering and suffering if we research any action the people are suffering if we go to the cause when you see the person is suffering we feel oh why people should suffer go and research about that person if you can go back to do really you will see there is a cause and cause began with Association and that is all these things that jetty jetty Sangha sorry batata jet ebrahim anata nallavan Mukti satyam Satyam my auditon who is telling this Lord Shiva the Lord Shiva and at the same time we find almost the same thing in the cool air Naboo Tantra nashandra eva mach das wat doe jaha savvy sangha job because of the association all problems the parents are very much all the time watching the children whatever frames they're having because they know from their experience that association the children they are playing with other people are the children's also but what type of children the association because they knew they know that this will come impress on their mind it may influence them so they like to take to the good situation so that is called me stronger eva mocked Assad surely if you are not in a bad company then there is a possibility then he will get liberation jajaja savvy he Sangha ja that is the association is the greatest defect those are savvy he sang gaja all problem comes from the Association Association of what are bad things wrong things temporary things and this suffering now those who are you keep information news about the our society in Indian society there are so many cases are going on and all those people who were at one time they were so rich now they are behind the bar why they were having lot of money and they were going on cheating people as we read in that newspaper as we come to know about that they were going on cheating and collecting fun and giving it to the powerful people political association what for they were doing how much money one needs how much suppose the fleet of flights maybe 45 16 20 flights at least waiting for him how many in he can use a little thinking then he will understand I don't need all these things this is sufficient for me yeah I need a comfort comfort but how much that is there so once we started disaster Sweeting ourself from the worldly things peace comes and along if the piece comes respect old society respects only those people what disassociated from the worldly things Lord Jesus was having nothing nothing and his parents were very odd many people very ordinary even from the family lineage he was having nothing he was having no property he was having no education he was having nothing then why people half of the world is bowing down at the feet of Jesus he was only having one thing this association which is called renunciation and that is that is the reason the whole world is bowing down at his feet same thing with the Lord Buddha no one goes to his father no one remember his father most of the people do not know even what is the name of his father but everyone knows Lord Buddha why he disassociated with the worldly things he actually renounced the worldly things and that is why all people goes at his feet but those who are now propagating in the name of Lord Buddha or in the name of Lord Jesus they are decorating themselves with all the ornaments and jewelleries that is the fun our Sangha they will go and that way this association with the worldly things name fame appreciation from the worldly people that is also a situation worldly associations wealth and property of course the situation's connections with influential people associations of the worldly things so that we have to understand and manu maharaj he is the law giver of the hindus and he is telling eco eva chirren dictum sit altum oh so high oh so high obon sidim a quiche equestria some punim Johar Tina he or they this- Mirage he is telling us a higher bond oh so higher bond means the one who is not having any Sahai support helpless o Shahi amines helpless ego eva all alone there is no one there to help him but if he goes on crying and blaming and cursing no he won't get the blessings of God but at that time if he's constantly depend on God then if directs his mind towards God Hartman he gets the success since the mind is free from other thoughts liberation is a certain that is the what the mana mana says eco I bechari nicktim system success is sure to whom is a higher bond one who is not having any support from any quarter think of it so we think that we need the worldly support not at all sometimes we think the Oh rich man is coming or this person influential people are coming they will help us what less if the God is not willing it is of no use even some people if they like to help if the God things that no I am NOT going to take the help of those people you won't take the only Association is only with God if we get the money if we want to do something good for others it is good and suppose we don't get and we are not doing anything that's also good what is there I have not taken the responsibility to remove all the miseries from the face of the art have I taken now only I am feeling that let everybody be happy so that is the idea this association means not that simply I will quietly see it and then I won't do anything not like that I am perfectly active constantly thinking to do something for the betterment of others but at the same time am disassociated and that's why I ramakrishna at the beginning he said it is very very difficult or so high oh bond what is that also higher this is this a higher there sometimes some people they come and they say how could you do all these things then I'd say octa higher because there is no one to help us that's why we do how come because there is only one person is there by Sami Vivekananda when his disciples and frames were telling Tommy G you have so many plans how you think that you are going to do that then Swamiji said of course with conviction is sale there is a power at my bad which is more powerful than the man the devil I even the gods that he is protecting me that is the thing are so high because the human support us ah hi maybe some other thing but so high is there that strong faith and see Ramakrishna he is telling about these again you have to spend a few days in solitude religion bars this new Janet ah Nell Janata again and again in the spiritual life is very very essential in the life of Hazrat Mohammad we find that he was having this solitude in the life of lord jesus also i think the 12 years period he was having only the good Association and the solitude in the life of Sri Ramakrishna in the life of all these great Souls we find this solitude solitude means going away from the worldly thoughts and valued situations and living in the company of the Holy in thoughts in meditations and that we are developing a wonderful spiritual life so that is called the solitude if God is responsible for everything again that question is coming if God is responsible for everything then why should people speak of good and evil but you advise one commits seen also by the will of God isn't that so one lady came and a husband who was telling why don't you take initiation from the Shaam EG and the whole family are devoted and there then she was telling with these things no no I have to get the answer why God is giving so much of miseries and suffering to all these people I have to know about it jokingly I was telling when you meet God you can ask but before that to meet God to ask this question you have to realize God and to realize God initiation so so you take the opportunity now this way we are constantly thinking another person is also joining with this question how can you understand the will of God the wonderful questions that's why i always suggest people who are little interested in a religious life spiritual life read the gospel of ceramic ich nur because that will clarify your all doubts why how can we understand the wheel of God that is a very important question there is no doubt that virtue and rise exist in the world ceramic ISNA the master giving the reply there is no doubt that virtue and vice exist in the world but God Himself is unattached to them and in the Vedanta this is a nice way they are explaining in the Brahman realization of the Brahman we were discussing but the time frame a time is very short to explain all those things tashan ghulam after creating the whole world whole universe everything the God is away from that as if ten fingers if you are measuring the ten fingers like this the Shanga lump he is just a wee that much buffer is there space is there gap is there between the creation and the Creator why dimension like this itati stirred the shanglam teaster he is staying there he has created this whole universe he has created it out of his own but ding he has dissipated it from him and then as if there is a gap of 10 if we are measuring the fingers like this the ten fingers that much space as if they're giving him Justin like that at Easter ghashang Ghulam the beyond this team space obtained fingers he is there that means it's not the ten fingers but he is dis isolated that's what see ramakrishna stealing he is unattached to them there is no doubt the virtue and vice exists in the world but the God Himself is unattached to them what is the meaning because virtue and vice both has come out of God himself we're from the Vice came the rice came from God heard from the virtue came of course from God this is the speciality of the Hindus they try to understand this very clearly not that that God is of course good but at the same time the vice is also creation of God and that is why there are so many other stories through the stories this has been explained so here there may be good and bad smell in the year ceramic is not giving an example but the air is not attached to them when the bayou the air is flowing if there is a flowers flower garden it carries the beautiful smell fragrance and there is something rotten things that also it carries but the air is totally unnatural either sky the father meant the space we think they do so much of dust is there now it is not on a terms that is the speciality that God has created this universe at the same time it is unattached that is why I Ramakrishna in answer to these two questions one is why God has created all these things and then if he has created why should we blame ourselves for good and bad he is the cause and another how will understand the wheel God and he says it has come out of God but at the same time God is not attached to these and the conversation against turned towards the life of the householder God has created but God is not associated why it is just like sometimes I say that the teacher he is giving the classes in the classroom in the school and he is narrating the whole thing explaining the whole thing to the students and then sometimes he is also hinting mentioning this is very important subject and very important paragraph this is all these things the teacher is telling to the students then the same teacher is making the question paper and the same teacher is also seeing the answer sheet and the same teacher giving the marks sometimes some are good some are bad why because it has been given to you the teacher has already said these are all bad thing these are all good things the God has said this is good and bad from me in the bhagavad-gita again refine that that is the condensed bhagavad-gita is the condensed form of the whole Vedanta and as it is wonderful is as it has explained the condensed form of the Vedanta there is a Lord is telling there's a two types of pro kitty I am having good and bad don't go for the bad take the good so that is the teaching is there now he has also given us that capacity to understand that that capacity to take the decision and now if we take the bad one we have to suffer that is the calm of Allah so in here see ramakrishna instead of going on explaining that he said God is detached from that you have to take the cessation good is also there bad is also there which one you like to choose if you take the bad one you have to suffer if you take the good one then you will be blessed so next he goes to the life of the householder a life of the householder is most important because the whole society is depending on the householders very wrongly I don't know why many people even educated people out of emotion perhaps they like to break the family life the family life that is most important that is why all the other stages all depending on the householders the students like the Brahma Charlie's there depending on householders then the monastics the monks there depending on householders the whole society depending on the householders if the householder life is bad then how can we expect that the good varieties of students will come Bromwich aliens will come good thinkers will come good monastic sannyasins mongs will come how can you expect that it is not possible that's why the importance has been given but all through in our rum this our Hindu philosophy a time came when some of the preacher scheme and they started talking about renunciation for each and every one that was a wrong thing and that is why the whole society became weak that is why we could not fight back the enemies and we had to be under their subjugation for many many hundred years and that is worse still we are suffering so once we take a wrong step wrong decision and suffering suffering generation after generation the philosophy is very important thing to hear ceramic is not the only Avatara who is giving most importance on both life renunciation and householders life house oldest life is very important and he says you see by leading a householders life a man needly needlessly dissipate his mental powers one has to be very very careful if you are associated with the world things we are all energy your association will take it out concentration is very very important and what is the concentration he says the loss he does incur can be made up if he takes the monastic life one is householders life another is monastic life monastic life is disassociation and concentration these are the two things I was talking with someone what is the monastic life give away what is the house owners life hold it that's all anywhere the any mentality even the one who is having the cladding on agoura outwardly human bein machine but if he wants to hold everything the power the position the money and the properties is household and that is why we have to understand one who is holding back everything oh it is mine it is mine that means isn't how does a mentally maybe that outwardly the curb that is wearing that shows that he is a renouncer what is the renunciation he is there in there but not of that he is not belonging to that whatever the disease are coming performing but with a disassociated mind so this is very subtle thing to understand very very subtle dig to understand apparently a person looking that he is very austere he is walking a name bear food he's on not putting the swarm clothings even in the winter let who is the very but that is only external we have to see internally his mind his association his desire and ceramic ishness coming to that he is stealing their attachment to last and greed diverse one from the way leading to God association or attachment to last and greed gamma Asia grow the Asia in the again in the bhagavad-gita history link comma Asia crew the Asia the master salam o Krishna is also telling it is not last alone one should be afraid of in the life of the world there is also anger anger arises when obstacles are placed in the way of desire which we hear from the words mouths of the Sri Krishna same thing gamma Asia crew the isha raj Oguna samoth bubble what is the raju guna active Raju guna samad Baba kama Asia crota isha raj Oguna samad bubba the ne sait maha hashanah mahatma be dinner ya boy dhinam night for sure that these are your enemies buddy buddy means enemy know it for sure that these are your enemies Raju guna samad baba it has been born out of your tremendous desire for activities comma and then grow the comma Aisha the all desires different type of desires but to decide a difference in desire I like to help people without being associated or expecting anything in return that is not a comma C Ramakrishna another other places he is also telling what is comma so that he is giving some example very very simple examples they are giving the comma is only that at the back of each and every thought action did I want to get back my reputation or that I am doing that should people should remember it that is called karma whatever I am doing people should know and appreciate and acknowledge that I have done that is called Karma but the same work when we are doing with totally disassociation is not common the same work the ramakrishna mission nations they're importing education so many monks all of us we were their associated with so many different type of activities we used to go and to help the people when they're in distress maybe there were floods where their art quakes where they're still our younger Swami's they go they are helping them now where you went whom we helped we have all forgotten we were asked to go to help them we did we came back before God we neighbor keep the addresses of those people and to go on reminding them do not forget that I once I came when there was a trouble in your life and I helped never we do but the same work when the other people are doing with some this desire remember that I helped you the same work but at the same time only one difference remember that I helped you the one drop of in a dew drop it fell in the ocean and then proud to say remem I gave a drop to you you have God all this water I also helped you to get that water mone rekho a quota d'alene she she she she means the dew drop we must remember to look at this foolishness suppose you don't go and help do you think they will die never they have the all things are there but it is our benefit that we go and help Sosa Ramakrishna very clearly he's telling it's not the last alone that one should be afraid of but at the same time anger so gamma Asia crew the Isha then the m m is the master who was writing down the conversation he was telling sometimes one cat comes to my plate and it's try to it stretches out its paw to take the fish from my plate but I don't know what to do shall I allow the cat to take it away or shall I immediately Ramakrishna is telling why a man should hiss but he shouldn't pour out the venom he must not actually injure others but he should make a show of anger to protect himself from enemies otherwise they will injure him but he Shanna she need not even his this is there but the sannyasins when the many many letters were coming some people jealous people as a research work on the life of cinema swami vivekananda one shankar prasad wish you a very famous historian he has researched on the life of xiaomi Vivekananda Merrilee Burke and she was in America in the whole Western world wherever Swamiji wind researched and the Shangri Babu in India so there's a this tube great research on Vivekananda more and Morris new facts are coming up there is a chapter in one of the volumes there's a some unhappy people there when Shami Vivekananda was here and somehow he got dad because of the blessings of his guru and the help of God he got successful and the success was reflecting on the country all the peep our Indian people they were getting back the self-confidence we can also do something because they lost it during the seven hundred years eight hundred years then suddenly some people a very handful of people but they are very active they were going on sending letters against him the all this nasty things they were writing about Vivekananda some people are very good in criticizing writing without actually helping what happened to them they are now in oblivion but in all the researchers they took them out and they were they were writing to be wakin on these frames and those who were helping him no no he's a very catalyst man is a bad person these that they were showing those letters and sham it is was throwing it away and he was telling if you like you can keep it it is your letter and the swami ji you are not giving any reply why didn't you say something then sharmaji towards see like just like a real monk he replied he said either they are criticizing or they are praising they cannot ignore me so just they are making the fun I am a personality you cannot ignore me either you have to criticize or you have to so that way people are jealous constantly for whom what he was doing helping the society helping the country his own there those people so the great contribution only one man 29 years old he came and then he returned from here maybe 34 35 so that young man one alone he was doing so much but they could not appreciate it so that is why this tremendous gamma and grow de and sri ramakrishna is telling for that worldly people should is when they someone went to Calcutta itself and was criticizing Vivekananda all the Calcutta praise even the famous editor so he came and told tom EG taylors we will throw him in the game the Bay of Bengal he has come to the city of Vivekananda and he's criticizing Vivekananda we will throw him out him Sir and Sami she told no you should not do that so the Vivekananda he showed the life of his own machines because we depend on god but people don't know sometimes those who are depending on God unnecessarily if you are criticizing complaining trying to create problem all bad results comes to them why God is hard they are associated with God depending on God protected by God so obviously maybe that you are not very happy some of the decisions but if you are going against it and trying to create problem this happens and this one must be very very careful and a devotee is telling I find it extremely difficult for a householder to realize God how few people can lead the life you prescribe for them I haven't found any devotee means again this master there's a very intelligent man Saddam occasion immediately inspiring and he's telling why should that be so when the devotee in the under the name of devotee the master was putting this question it's so difficult how many people will be able to realize a me the master is tailing why should that be sir I have heard of a deputy magistrate in those days the deputy magistrate is a biggest post highest post because the British were ruling so deputy magistrate was a tough most post for the Indians and one person his name was Pratap Singh he's a great man he has many virtues compassion and devotion to God and he meditates on God certainly there are people like him even in the householders life there are so wonderful people are there the practice of discipline is absolutely necessary why shouldn't the man succeed if he is practicing sadhana asking the questions Ramakrishna himself God himself he is asking this question if you are practicing sadhana what is the sadhana disassociation from the last and greed that's what that's all if you are practicing this shadonna then y1 not get the liberation and the vision of God the practice of discipline is absolutely necessary why shouldn't a man succeed if he practices sadhana then he said real faith faith in the words of Guru the Guru's word that should have the faith guru means one who is removing the darkness from the eyes of the devotees a real seeker of God what is the darkness I en me conception constantly thinking me and mine I and me so that conception should go and that is called the faith in the Guru's words Thank You friends for coming over here and the next class we will listen how he
