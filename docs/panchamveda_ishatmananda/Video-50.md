[51: Panchama Veda 51: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqRKjN2SFOc)

hmm let us begin today's the panchama veda the gospel of krishna we were reading the where bhagavan sirama krishna he is explaining about samathi and we were reading that he is explaining the sabta bhumi that is from the yogic point of view in the yoga it says that in the human body there are seven stages and there when the mind reaches over there slowly slowly it reaches on the top of the head and then person goes into shamadhi the fast and foremost is the muladhara mula aadhara is the root adhara means the container here at the root in the container as if the main power is there and when it rises it gives a wonderful power that is called yoga shakti yogic shakti and white is not rising it is there dormant latent but it is there why it is not rising why we can't activate it because our mind is not pure this is the one point that everywhere in the yoga in the karma yoga in the gyana yoga in the dhyana yoga everywhere the mind should be purified how the mind can be purified non-attachment or no attraction for the things which are changing and things that are changing it's called worldly things when the mind is attached to that it is always wavy so much of different type of waves thoughts it is inside the mind and it is turbulent it is impure in that way it is impure the pure and impure the difference is only this much the moment the mind is withdrawn from the worldly things temporary things it is pure so when that mind is pure immediately that power starts rising from muladhara to swadhishthanam the first three petals the first three stages below naval line never line and below two and the moment it comes to the heart anahata then comes vishuddha then aga chakra in between the two eyebrow then the sahasrara here when one can be free from all other thoughts that is the sheba lord shiva he is explaining the yoga and he is the master of yoga he is the king of yoga that lord shiva he is telling what is yoga sarva chinta parityagi when all the chintas all the thoughts chinta means thoughts when we the when there is no thoughts there is no way there is naturally the mind is tranquil niscinta no chinta nishtinta there is no thought so it is tranquil then that is called yoga now the mind we have to give some thought to the mind some activity to the mind it is always active we cannot simply say or try to make it totally vacant it is not possible so we have to give some idea what is mind is the thoughts and what are the thoughts all attached with the things that is worldly now suppose we have to stop that thought what we have to do what we can do we have to give we have to supply good thoughts when we are supplying the good thoughts the thoughts of god then slowly slowly the worldly thoughts which is the turbulent that goes away so that is that we try and we know when you are trying these things we know that it happens like this way so this is the way we should try to do bhagavan shiva said like that and uttara gita it says you have to make your mind just like the sky it is so broad so vast aakashan manasam kritwa you have to think that it is not the small boundary of this mind it's bigger bigger bigger bigger and all pervading is covering the everything and then that mind the thought waves totally stopped nothing is there when there is no clouds also in that condition the whole sky if we can imagine nishchalam then you must know that is called steady mind again and again everywhere in different slokas different ways in different languages they are asking us to still the mind the mind should be free from all thoughts cerama krishna is giving the suggestion how we can do that go on taking the name of god if you are taking the name of god repeating the name of god trying to meditate on the image of god then slowly other thoughts are stopped then remain only one thought that is the thought of god and his name so from so many millions of thought waves now we have come to one thought and now merge in that one thought i am thinking of god i is there and the i is thinking of god the two existence it becomes one now i am god when it becomes i am god in that condition samadhi what is the lakshana what is the symbol of the samadhi one and there is no thought sometimes some people as because there's a beautiful places here in chicago where the lake shore is there no sound no vibration we can go and sit over there and then slowly slowly we will try to expand our mind like that huge vast water body and then again rising up to the sky and expanding the mind in that way and let us see what happens when you can come back after two three minutes at least if we can concentrate for few seconds then we'll understand what is the joy of oneness all suffering because of the different thoughts and the peace can be achieved only by developing one thought that is what bhagavan's ramakrishna he is indicating then comes the heart then throat the vishuddha on the center exactly in the center of the head means thousand one thousand means sahasrara petals one thousand petals of the flower we need not to count one or two three four like that but thousand there's a lot many numbers of petals are there if you are thinking over that our guru is sitting the preceptor is sitting and the guru is the most holy person to me so i am placing guru on the top of my head and when i am thinking him it is not the head it is the flower its not the body it is the stem of that flower and over that i am thinking my guru is sitting i am going near him touching his feet getting the blessings and slowly slowly i am also becoming purified after a man has attained the samadhi all his actions drop away the problem comes from where action action produces reactions there is something some action must be there something is happening that means some action was there the after the action reaction when the samadhi is there when a man attains the shamadi no action when there is no action no activity no result when there is no result the mind is tranquil all devotional activities such as worship japa and all the like as well as the worldly duties ceases to exist for such person that person need not to do anything he need not to do joppa or meditation or go to the temple or worship or worldly duties what whatever he was having nothing he need not to do but just before that some people will be very happy not to do that and some people are not trying not to do that but physically they are not doing mentally they are doing mentally they are going on thinking so many things that is also action so sometimes we think that when we are free from action that means physically we are not doing anything so there is no result no we are thinking we are thinking of some person someplace something and naturally that reaction is also coming so this is the reason bhagavan says like this why a person after attending the samadhi why he need not to work because religion is being and becoming who will do the work the person the human being for what god realization now that he has already realized the god what he is going to do when we go to a pilgrimage center may maybe a temple before going to temple we call our friends and then we road in the in some car or anything some vehicle then we drive we go we chat about that we reach over there when we enter the temple and sit before the image then we don't move everybody sits over there and close their eyes and try to meditate and prayer silently so that means when we reach to the destination when we receive the samadhi get the samadhi we when we can tranquil our full mind then what happens we become we transform ourselves to that particular object we were meditating on so this is the before reaching so many activities after reaching and realizing no activities that is what bhagavan sirama krishna is telling and then he is pointing out to the devotees of brahma devotees but the manifestation of the divine power are different in different beings that is also we have to keep in mind manifestation are different categories are different the different skills of realizations are there the all people many people they are trying to realize god in their own way but when they are realizing according to their capacity they are realizing not that all can achieve all power no all knowledge no so that is why ramakrishna is telling manifestation of the divine power are different in different beings ordinary souls are afraid but the others like the narada they are not afraid then he is telling to a devotee of the brahma shamaj can you tell me why you dwell so much on the powers and glories of god so this is a wonderful question whenever we go to any religion we'll be always seeing that the prayer means oh god you are so glorious so glorious so glorious like that full of uh you are so compassionate and you are full of love and this way we will be praising sudama krishna is telling why do you do like that as because you are away from god when you are near god with god you needn't to do all those things because he is so near and dear why should he have to go on praising again and again and he is telling that i asked the same thing to keshav shane why do you so often say so such things as oh god what beautiful flowers thou hast made oh god dao has created the heavens the star the ocean and so on those who love splendor themselves are fond of dwelling on god's splendor so this is the hint that he is giving now we love that all these things and that is the reason we decorate all this then the temple the church they'll be constructing in such a big way then there will be all golds here and there one person who was so eager to tell me that look at this there's a whole carving that you see standing just from one stone and look at this the whole pillar from one stone you know where from the stone came i told now the question is whether in this temple everywhere only stone there is no god everywhere he was going on praising about the stone and the carving and the decoration and you know the chandelier you know how much it cost there's a mosque and it is a very very rich mosque so many chandeliers and the description of the sunderlands where from the broad how they brought how they hang what is the weight how many lamps are burning inside where it is in the house of god but where is the god that you have to find out i do not do not know why we are doing this decorating so much because we love those things that is the reason okay of course it should be neat and clean all care should be taken so that so many different type of people are coming so they feel comfortable and their security all those things should be taken care of but why so much of decoration it is not necessary why we do see krsna's giving the answer because we love to do those things we love to get and have those things so in the name of god also we are doing those things it is not necessary at all so why do you do that those who love splendor themselves are fond of dwellings once a thief stole the jewels from the image in the temple of radha kantha that is in the dakshinesha muthurbabu entered the temple and said to the deity mutual is the jaminda the landlord he got the information he came and he was telling what a shame oh god you couldn't save your own ornaments jewelries then suramar krishna was standing there immediately suramar krishna is not a person to say oh because the my landlord and he is the owner he is speaking he is not going to spare immediately i said mature does he who has lakshmi for his handmade and attendant even lack any splendor those jewels may be precious to you but god they are no better than lumps of clay that is the idea when one is progressing towards god we have to have this clear idea that is why the gospel of sirama krishna is so important one gentleman he was telling i don't know anything about hindu religion but suddenly i got a book there's a gospel of sirama krishna i am reading it and i can't stop reading almost every day i read the same pages and i get new new meaning so because of this when a person is really eager to know about god they get meaning out of this and some people they don't get anything any idea because there's no stories but if you read some stories this happened then he walked on the water then he saved then we are all thrilled why because of our mind we wanted to see all the miracles in god but those who really want to get the knowledge they don't like all those things it is easy for god everything is possible for god what is there he is creating he can also destroy and yes because he can destroy he can save also it's nothing is impossible for him everything is possible but i love him only as a child of a king the preems you don't care whether his father is a king or not he doesn't bother whether father is having this much of property or not he is only caring about the father and he is not all the time going and praising the father as other ministers and other people are doing to him the king is a father relation only love that is what swami sirama krishna is hinting at you need not to do all those things if you love god when you love god then we need not to do all this then he is singing dive deep in the sweetness of god's glees so this is the very very important this is the bengali song dive deep into the sweetness of god's place what need have we of his infinite creation and unlimited glory we are going on praising praising praising so many things we go on telling what is that if god is my father or my mother why should i have to go on telling all this dive deep oh my dive deep in the ocean of god's beauty if you descend to the atmos depths there you will find the chain of love when you go down really then we come out with all the james what are those james the love of god the moment we get god realize god what happens we get everything that is the reason one person he was very clever bhagavan sirama krishna is stealing he was going on praying to god praying to god i don't know need anything oh god please come please but when the god came and told what do you want he said no nothing from you only one or two things let me eat with my grandson from a golden plate from the gold made plate that means i will be rich and i am going to eat from the same plate with my grandson that means i am going to leave for a long time so he was very clever he put his prayer in such a way even the god is perhaps scratching his head what to do so this type of things won't give us god realization so to dive deep see ramakrishna is telling and also he is continuing it is also true that after the vision of god the devotee desires to witness his lila this is another option when a devotee is not a ghani he is not a yogi he is a devotee so the word that he is using a devotee means he only wants to see the divorce play of god because all these things that he sees nothing but the play of god leela so that is the reason he is telling the desire to witness the leela after the destruction of the ravana as rama's hand nikosha ravan's mother began to run away for fear of her life this is a story srama krishna is mentioning lakshman said to rama brother please explain this strange thing to me this nikosha is an old woman who has suffered a great deal from the loss of her many sons and here she is so afraid to afraid of losing her own life that she is taking to her heels then rama made her come near gave her assurance of safety and asked her why she was running away nikosha answered o rama i am able to witness all this leela of yours because i am still alive i want to live longer so that i may see the many more things you will do on this earth so this is the love for god they want to see everything how the gods manifesting some of the devotees they will be visiting to our different centers ahmakrishna mission centers they are well read they know how the ramakrishna mission started with only these 12 young people young men and then they were not having the food they were renting a hosted house with eight rupees per month rent the house dilapidated even then they had to pay eight rupees in those days and the there was no food only one dhoti was their cloth was there all were in the loin cloth they used to live inside and if anyone was supposed to go outside for some work only that he used to wear and go out that was the condition but on other days the veneer the devotees and the swamis they say barangar days but days of austerity tremendous austerity and they're all educated people they will all of them they belong from calcutta and nearby areas their parents were very rich people most of them even then they were doing like that and from there now ramakrishna mission everywhere wherever you go everywhere the ramakrishna nation and many many places the devotees now the golden young new devotees they do not know and they will say is there any ac room available in your guest house before are going to to booking for that they will be asking for ac rooms and whether we have to sit on the floor to eat or we can get the table and chair we are like this the life is changing everywhere the ramakrishna mission wherever you go how it is the person who could never speak a single english sentence only if you think thank you like those words he used to say ramakrishna now his asthmas are all over the world now very educated learned people are joining as a brahmacari monk this is the leela this is the divine leela who is helping the ramakrishna mission no government no government backing are no rich people the business organizations or the corporate build things no nothing only the ordinary people they are sending some little bit of money with that spreading like the wildfire so many in also places if you go and see the library of the calcutta gold program krishna mission institute of culture is worth seeing collection of books so many scholars are living over there and doing research on different subjects so these are the things that is happening is it not leela really this is the miracle how things are taking shape everything is going on and on people do not understand people they think we are doing i am doing he is doing no nobody it is just because the god has picked up some of the people that he will do or she will do they will do they bless it otherwise anyone can come and do it so this way bhagavan is telling you see this is the leela i like to see you how can i live unless i see pure soul devotee now again he is coming back the god love those who are pure soul and he is telling to shivanath a devotee of the brahma-samaj to it to him he is telling i like to see you how can i leave unless i see pure soul devotees that's why i always say to our devotees come to this temple when nobody is there particularly in the morning no time in america and particularly our places there every time you come it is all quiet nobody is there only in the saturday sunday some visitors are coming sit over here look at takur do you really love love me ask harkur if you are loving me why can't i come i am not getting the call from you that means i am not pure make me pure can i really try to become pure it is impossible because so much of desire within the mind but if you like bikshani mahoja just a glance of your eye if you look at me glance at me immediately all my mohas all my desires all my foolish ideas everything will go away i'll be totally pure ready to receive your grace why don't you make me like that so many people are getting their blessings why not me if you can come and talk to him you'll see you listen to it because he has promised so that is called devotee complete faith and love complete faith and love so say the surama krishna is telling how can i live unless i see pure soul devotees the god also waiting to see the pure soul devotees the devotees who really love him like him so god is waiting over there in bengali he used to give a call oh my children where you are come come to me just like a beloved father used to give that call and if we can listen to that come and sit before him talk to him you need not to go on taking the holy name just talk to him whatever thoughts are coming in the mind then the devotee brahma devotee he is asking another question sir do you believe in the reincarnation of soul do you believe in the reincarnation of the soul he is asking the brahma devotee sirama krishna is answer yes they say he's not telling i am telling they say there is something like that how can we understand the ways of god through our small intellect this is the one university i went one young man he was going on putting questions up to christians he was not he was listening again well why not this why not that is going on there is no complete answer you have to realize otherwise how can you understand that if you don't understand that it is impossible for anyone to make you understand so you will understand when you realize it yourself then only otherwise how so this way sirama krishna never wanted to spend some time unnecessarily talking with this answering this question he said yes they say there is something like that how can we understand the ways of god through our small intellects many people spoken about the reincarnation therefore i cannot disbelieve it many people spoke about the reincarnation and in the bhagavad-gita also arjuna he was also doubting when the krishna was telling in that my first life i told these and these and this oh how come you are just about my age and now you are talking that you gave ah the lecture and the and the instruction of the yoga to him how it is possible then krishna also said again and again oh arjuna both of us are taking birth you do not remember but i do so that is the reason suramar krishna is telling in a very simple way so many people say that so how can i disbelieve it then about the bhishma also he told and then finally he is selling it is about uh this the master masha is describing about half past eight when the evening worship began in the prayer hall soon the moon rose in the autumn sky and flooded the trees and creepers of the garden with its light after prayer devotees began to sing the plays he couldn't record with the god's holy name when the music had stopped sirama krishna prostrated himself on the ground and making salutations to the divine mother again and again said bhagavat bhakta bhagavan again the hint he is giving bhagavat means the knowledge the book bhakta means the student who is studying that book and bhagavan means taking that knowledge within himself the student himself is becoming the teacher he is becoming the master unless and until listening to god thinking about god meditating on god one is not transforming into god it is of no use so he is again and against telling these bhagavad bhakta bhagavan that means when you have come to god and you are praying to god try to realize him and be god sudama krishna accompanied by rakhal in the next event he is mentioning it is it was wednesday november 15 1882. srama krishna was going and several other devotees they came to calcutta in a carriage and called for aim the master mahashaya all of them they came they used to go and suramar krishna had a very wonderful technique in one place if he goes on talking it will be boring so he used to call all the devotees then he'll be going along with them chatting and then he will collect all the devotees together so that they also develop friendship devotees of srama krishna they feel like they are relatives to each other their friends to each other like that they developed he came to the aim at the school where he was teaching and from there they said for the maidan madan means the ground is the center place of calcutta sirama krishna wanted to see the wilson circus he was going to circus see so many different type of interest most of the people they will be frowning oh my god a religious person going to circles but he used to go why to observe and now we will see what is there as the carriage rolled along the crowded ah chit poo road it is also again now also it is very crowded this chit poo road his joy was very great when he saw so many people he was very happy like a little child he leaned fast out of one side of the carriage and then from the other side talking to himself as if addressing the passes by now he's mentioning to me aim i find the attention of the people fixed on earthly things he's observing the people the passersby from both the windows of that courage and then he's mentioning they're all rushing about for the sake of their stomachs no one is thinking of god look at his observation so when he is going and seeing he is observing thousands of people they are there mingling because the marketplace and here he couldn't find anyone who is thinking of god then afterwards they arrived to that place and a cheapest seats were purchased the tickets but the cheapest seat you know the in the circus very costly it will be in the front row cheapest will be on the top and they have to go because the devotees were also not very rich they had to purchase the cheapest ticket and sriram krishna went over there the devotees should not think that we could not purchase a good ticket for our thakura our god sriam krishna he is telling her this is a good place i can see all the show well from here he is encouraging them so they should not feel that they are supposed to but now they and i was also going with the person he was trying to take as good care as it is possible and it was so hard in the texas and when i was thinking to enter into his car because all american cars are having the heating and cooling system he declared swamiji one thing i must tell you i forgot to tell you beforehand i don't have any air conditioning in my car oh my god utterly then the other people to whom we went over there they were telling swamiji you should not go now it is more than 108 fahrenheit it's so hard and it will be very difficult then the boy was telling i will drive it fast lot of air will come from outside and it will cool down i told okay let us try what is going to happen because he has come from a long way he wanted so let me go then he he was telling we will go in a canoe of course i went there and he was telling swamiji do you like to row the board on the bhai now what is your age 32 35 and do you know what is my age so that also keep under consideration because that is true 30 years before if you had given this type of offer i would have jumped on this but now i have to be very very careful now of course everything he took here he was rowing the boat and all this i enjoyed and then he wanted to show me from the top it was so hot but i went i thought anyway one thing good that he is doing forcing me helping me to reduce my calories that is also that is also necessary for me but i enjoyed so this way the takur is also very happy and he is expressing a joy in such a way that the people who took him over there they should not feel oh we brought takur over here and could not give him proper service the circus and here in the circus again the srama krishna he was pointing out this is the beauty of a holy person wherever they go whatever they see it in whatever condition they are they will go to that one because ramakrishna himself is telling see that compass all the time that one hand it will put to the north always the holy person's mind is always on guard wherever they go he went over there so many shows were going on the circus rider an english woman stood on one foot on the horseback running horseback and as the horse passed away under the rings she jumped through them always a lighting on one foot on the horseback tremendous practice the horse is running and the iron rings are there the moment the horse is coming under that ring she is jumping on one leg and again balancing on the running horseback on that leg takur he saw it and he was telling did you see that english woman stood on one foot on the horse and here they have translated english woman but taku said bb because in bb means lady in hindi they say bb so thakur was telling that did you see that english showman stood on one foot on her horse while it ran like lightening the horse was running very fast how difficult a fit that must be then he is telling she must have practiced a long practice practice practice practice makes a man perfect the meditation also is a practice in the beginning in the middle in afterwards every time we sit our mind is not tranquil so many thoughts are crossing but don't give it go on sitting over there thinking so many things again at least for once again i am thinking of god like that he is telling one faces the same difficulty leading the life of a householder srama krishna is telling if you succeed in it through the grace of god and as a result of their spiritual practices but most people fail then he is telling these the householder should be careful because the householder's life is just like that there are so many obstacles so many things will be going on happening sometimes it's very good sometime it's not so that time all these things can be all right for those people who are going on praying to god and depending on them otherwise it is really very difficult one cannot stop it entering the world they become more and more involved in it they drawn in the worldliness and suffered the agonies of death if you only like jaatak janaka have succeeded through the power of their austerity in leading the spiritual life as householders therefore spiritual practice is extremely necessary otherwise one cannot rightly live in the world so this is a wonderful teaching of bhagavatam krishna sometimes what happened we are very good workers we come and we work in the customers we do so many things and then afterwards we go away sometimes you will see so many people they're going in the temples some are cooking some are cleaning some are doing visit dressing vegetables so many things they will be doing saturday sunday they are busy giving their time but they are going on talking about the worldly things the result i am sorry i don't know maybe you have no result actually that's why it's ramakrishna one should attain the spiritual discourse is why to know this to learn this these these are the secrets and then to apply it again and again when you go to work when you are going in a company and all people are discussing in so many ways suddenly one should at least raise this oh what happened you know in that company of bhagavatam krishna all these people they were talking like this immediately the whole mind comes over there so that is the reason one should learn otherwise it is of no use when he was very young sirama krishna he was accompanying the ladies elderly ladies they were all going to a nearby village pilgrimage center vishal akshmi and then he found the small little boy of six years he found all the ladies are talking about household things then he how to say to these elderly ladies that you should not speak like this think of god because you are going to a temple prepare your mind to pray he fainted over there naturally all their attention came to their little boy oh why what has happened and they were going on doing many things they forgot about the worldly things and then all their attention came on the sirama krishna and who is siram krishna god himself so when the mind came he actually helped them to put their mind on god he drew their mind that's why he's krishna he's drawing attracting the minds of the people to him and when they were thinking another elderly lady she was the moment she uttered the name of god the boy got up afterwards he said when you are going to temple think about god and prepare your mind to think about god from the moment you think that i am going to the temple go on thinking about god and then when you are going by a car or by a vehicle don't talk any other things either talk about god or think about god then when you reach over there think about god so that is the way you guess the best result and the pilgrimage center means to the best result so that is when someone is going to the belure mod if he is if he can think that this is the door from where the maha sharadamani devi came and she got down over here she walked through this road this is the place where vivekananda brahmananda tiriyananda they all used to live and walk and they that that way if they go on remembering all those things that will help them spiritually otherwise they'll be taking snaps and then our the guards are there they they are not allowed to take photographs to the guard will come and they will be sometimes hiding the guard they will be taking photograph all these things go away when they go away they are the same old personality as they came it is of no use for coming to the pilgrimage center so it's ramakrishna he is guiding us he is telling that you must prepare your mind for that and when you are entering into the samsara the world it is like this so get always prepared so many things may happen but i should go on remembering god thinking of god because the life will pass so many sceneries we have to see but i am always with god whatever comes so this way master got into the carriage with the devotees and went to balurambo's house from there he came over here the con conversation turned into the caste system this is the problem of the hindus everybody will be criticizing the hinduism because of the cost system suramar krishna said now his all this solutions are very simple the cost system cannot be removed by one me can be removed by one means only and that is the love of god the caste system can be removed by one means only and that is the love of god the lovers of god do not belong to any caste the mind the body the soul of a man become purified through divine love when a person is going on taking the name of god and that's why initiation is so important when a person has taken initiation he is thinking about the god taking the name of god his mind is becoming pure when his mind means his thought is becoming pure his soul and the body is also becoming pure and in that condition only one thing comes in his mind that is love love for every being because god has created everything so obviously it is my beloved my god my lord he has created how can i hate then the god what he will think i cannot do that so that way when the thinking is coming naturally he gets the blessings of god the srama krishna is telling like this holy mother masharadha mani devi she used to do in her own way a very very subtle way when she was in bangalore in south indian city the bangalore and we have a very big temple long back the devotees were there they invited ma sardamani devi and ramakrishna nandaji was also there that time mother used to stay in a room which is adjacent to the temple and south india the even now if you go you'll see very very orthodox people and they never allowed the muslim invasion over there so they are very strict to accept anything new they protected themselves from the onslaught of the foreign invasions so they are like that it is continuing it is in their psyche now psychology and along with that and the other people some of the people who can be called the priest they started putting on different type of system caste system came from that because bhagavan sri krishna himself is telling chathur bharanam maya system guna karma vibhagasha i had according to the aptitude resulting from the disposition of the nature i have made is a social order of forecast chathur varnam the forecast maya system govern himself is telling according to their work capacity and quality never through the birth but even then the devotees particularly no i can't say them devotee call them devotee they used this thing for their benefit so utilizing that religious things for their benefit distorted the whole thing and they made the division among the devotees and then they said brahmana shatria basha and sudra the moment you make the classes and the divisions it is easy for weak people to rule those who are really strong people they don't bother because they know that the personality everybody will be at their under their umbrella but when they're weak they always divide and rule so these people did like that sirama krishna when the conversation going on he said the caste system can be removed to the love mother how she behaved like that this bangalore being in the south they were very very orthodox type of people if you are not in the upper caste that means the brahmana and the um what's called shatriya you cannot enter into the temple but mother observed she used to see it all people are sitting and taking her blessings she observed a humble man never entered into the temple he was always standing outside the temple and trying to offer his pranam to mother from so distance the mother inquired then the devotees told mother we cannot ask him to come inside because he is a low-cost person if he entered into the temple all these people that you see the mainly the brahmins they will never come so that is the reason we won't be able to call him mother didn't answer after one or two days suddenly he said i have some prasada to be distributed among the devotees my son standing over there will you please come inside and help me to distribute look at it that person who is not supposed to enter inside the temple mother addressed that particular person and called son will you please enter and help me to distribute this prasad among this all people were jubilant to get the prasad they forgot that he is a untouchable and they forgot that he is entering into the temple because mother room was adjacent to the temple and you have to cross the temple go inside the temple then only you can enter into the mother's room and the prasada was there this man he was so happy he forgot that he is not supposed to enter into the temple and he brought and he started distributing and the people brahmins they also for god but he is an untouchable person he is distributing and they also happily accepted the prasad so this way mother proved that through the love of god this can be removed this caste system unless and until the caste system is not removed as long as people are not understanding it as long as long people are not questioning those people who are imposing these why you are asking me not to enter into the temple what specialty you are having tell me then i won't enter tell me this is a social place anyone can come why you are not allowing me to go just because you have a title just because you born in a brahmin family no i also have red gita i also know the upon nation i also worship god i also love god all the qualities that you are having the same quality i am also having how come that you are here it is not your personal property again so this type of question when it will come and slowly people will understand it will come because the more and more the education will spread people will understand this they will remove these then the real bright hinduism the people will understand wonderful hinduism then stop dharma the gods bhagavan srama krishna has come in the human form as sudama krishna to establish religion and these are the things that you have to remove from our society so that
