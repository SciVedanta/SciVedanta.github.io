dr. Tom returned dr. Cheever could be really dumb Gong Gong SUIM da da da boo beginner da porra dodging our American writer the Christopher issue he mentioned about the Saddam Trishna the phenomena a remarkable person Saddam Krishna a phenomena a remarkable person white this pages if we read from the gospel of Solana Krishna that is from page 543 five four three then you find us in envisioning himself is given an account of his spiritual practices and it is really really very interesting how a person one person can practice so many varieties of spiritual disciplines scientists instilling to the devotee God made me pass through the disciplines of various paths fast according to the purana then according to the tundra I also followed the discipline of the readers at first I practice sadhana in the pancha very immediate group of Tulsi plant and used to sit inside it and meditate sometimes as to bike ride with a longing heart modern model or Rama Rama but is and he is going on him I practiced the discipline of the Tantra and then I practiced the time discipline of the Vedas Buddhist means the Vedanta I became a sannyasi I used to lie down in the JD shouldn't've in a small place where usually the people is to change their dresses for the bathing and conquer conquer there now he is telling the essence of the Vedanta is the brahmana alone is really a sense of the Vedanta the Brahman alone is real and the world illusion Tsuchida Ananda Brahman described in the Vedas and the same sat-chit-ananda Sheba of the Tantra and searched on the Krishna Your Honor these are the three the rules the parents of the Hindus the Hinduism apparently shows that there are so many varieties of sex at a nun in reality they all Hindus are foreign to the same goal sometimes they call it as Brahman sometimes Shiva and sometime Krishna or vision so these are the three parts one is the Vedantic another tantric another question ism but all the leading to the same goal uniqueness of saddam business this he practiced all the three paths now just let us think about the tundra Tantra means the actions activities tan until mr. native Ghana India tundra which targeted Turkmen tea means this derivative the Sanskrit word tournament e means we studied at the analysis the world and what does it mean that is everywhere Bastardo and everywhere what can be everywhere any human form now that what is it consciousness to eternia the children the consciousness is every and that has been termed as Shiva who we have to notice this only the name is given even as Shiva and nothing else and in the parameter also saying the same consciousness all-pervading everywhere they had to hunt is even the name as brahmana the Brahmin also the same everywhere that is also the consciousness this Tantra added up Atlanta and the bishop again and again we have discussed over here he is also be starring the Mishnah he's also all-pervading most of the Hindus also don't know it that is the problem sometimes some people will say no we only worship the Krishna we worship the bridge new and you should not enter it or temple or you should not come over here I am NOT going to take the sanctified food the prasada from you and like these like that I'll acknowledge that's why the gospel of Saddam of distance the book is da book which can truly help us to understand the religion today's topic the subtle are the ways to determine certain sukshma at the wisdom Dharma and what is this Dharma the ultimate reality understanding the ultimate reality the people are very intelligent in the worldly matters they have many many are there their scientists their researchers the doctors this opening but if you talk about the religion the top light in children why because these knowledge is very very something and what is the solidity understanding one thing that all this manifestation that we see illusionary it's so hard to believe when this is is all this manifestation that you see you taste you touch you feel our energy including my body my mind and my children mind all these are the round you know you think in this so obviously it was not possible for all the people to accept this so they started another path okay at the only people do suffer because if you are accepting these phenomena the manifested one has to work with to suffer and that is the reason again and again the God in a very certain way it comes and trying to help people if you like this okay then they will again try in a different way Tantra developed country the activity in the activity the path of knowledge no activity only mentally you are going on discriminating which other which other which are you're constantly you are trying to understand I am NOT the body and I have not these are not these are not these and that we so difficult so naturally second Thunder what is the Thunder activity what is the activity I am thinking that this is the source of power and that power I am invoking and from that power unit of understand what he will understand that consciousness everywhere all pervading and that consciousness is working in the form of the Kali and that is the reason this is this way in graves this is the Tantra even some people cannot do that so fourteen more certain way and that is vishna visa the devotion so they come and they cook for food food for the god and dress but the guard see now we are covering the god so in that night time you sleep so the car is covered and this way and so what is soft and soon loving so I am now it's a good night to God and then even go out like this like this and we'll cover this one also as you always close the door and then go to bed and we take a cover on the bed like the same thing so that is called the rationalism and the B story game then slowly the activity will also understand the same Vishnu is all-pervading now the thing is all permissiveness and limitedness who is limited means are and we all perceive God and what I should do try to understand that and not limited I am also a permissive and why I should do that because of the love as long as I will go on thinking that I am limited and small and to suffer again and again I am going to suffer and what is the suffering but then date eight months in the womb is not a joy is terrible and the small baby in the womb of a mother how he's somehow surviving and then after the birth also so many years passed and then green are also so many challenges and the whole life nothing but the challenges tension and all the things and one day I die what is the job we do it because there is no other option and just we think that we will go and dance in the bar and drink and drive and do these and I'm going to attend the marriage ceremony I'm going to do this all these things I'm searching for what joy but the joy is our temporary Joy's the one group of people after attending a marriage ceremony they were all coming back and they were all singing dancing inside the past 50 of them and then the driver was surprised he was also dancing sitting in the will and then all of them they were gone 50 of them the win for joy they meant the depth so this is the live every day we are reading in the newspaper circling the birthday birthday we will understand that there must be paste and into this and that is the reason when Jesus is telling the kingdom of heaven is within you what is the kingdom of heaven part 1 enjoy kingdom of heaven is nothing but the permanent joy amrita she Putra bead on the Seas what is the unwritten what is the rumble Bassnectar what is their power and joy and how the power ranger we come we I am not limited and how we reached that so three different paths have been offered by the Hinduism the part of knowledge Vedanta the part of action dontoh and part of devotion personalism so these are the three major parts there that is needing now if you go to the Hindu temples one is Kali temple one is the Durga temple another is Rama temple another is this temple that temple so many varieties of temples but any temple dedicated to any deity actually it is devotion so it is all in one category and if you go to the Tantra activities the actions so that is under and tardies you find estaba plus a beta then it says know that you have not born here unnecessarily you are thinking in this way completely different the room before the coracle this is different so this repast offered for the three different type of people according to their intellectual understanding the capacity understanding and sadhana business telling God made me to pass through all this can imagine in one life we cannot complete one bath is so difficult and here cinema Krishna God made me pass through the disciplines of various plants I am this tree the three rules of the in reason I cannot utter the word o in Samadhi why say I will request you to give the attention to this oh that is over there on the top of the car there's so much respect we give to that home oh mighty grandma in the Upanishad in our higher stitcher he says who is the gunman and we have discussed over here from just pulpit that what is that Oh whom is nothing but the Brahmin shut up Brahmin and now here's Ramakrishna and page 544 he is telling I cannot utter the word whom in Samadhi why is there I cannot see home unless I count down very far from the state of Samadhi so didn t understand - what is God for this current realization what is our monkey Anna what is from manana what is the supreme knowledge this one even though art Thou O the Sun the one has to come down to a level where it can think and what is this Samadhi is a eager sloop it becomes all sane so naturally there is no difference there is no other thing and not necessary to say anything friends we are discussing of course here I'm telling you are listening but you know it is all in ink literally we were trying to these imagine what is it but what is actually T's we do not know unless and until we really really realize it and it is very difficult but they're ordinary sadaqa has heard many people to realize this this is only for those with the Jesus sees I am my father in heaven are one this is not dark narrating not that the anyone can say that they're saying and declaring is easy now we are free America is a freak we can say a TI i and my father in heaven at one who is going to sue biggest in nobody okay you think that okay continue but truly if you like to understand what it means one an updo and that means there is nothing else I don't know how I can express it because this oneness the feeling of oneness is so unique those who are trying to meditate sometimes you can feel that you don't know that the body you are not meditating you are meditating I am meditating this conception is a separation I am meditating the Beast still the high is there and when you forget that you are meditating and completely merged in the consciousness that is called Samadhi it's not so easy and from debt to come back and he says I saw sluggish destiny I serve the regions described in the scriptures after coming down he is giving the authorization the scriptures when you are reading the scriptures the targa shooters and all the holy books he says sometimes I saw the universe filled with sparks of fire sometimes I saw all the quarters glittering with light as if the world were a leak of mercury sometimes I saw the world as if made of liquid silver sometimes again I saw all the quarters alumi as if with the lighter Roman candles you know the in Calcutta in those days they were using a candle the cash lights the dish to college Roman temples so you see experiences tarry with those described in the scriptures dooty dooty everywhere that light when you are meditating forgetting your body that is the basic then your mind then your thoughts and then you are marching into there and you do not know what is there then the gain slowly or coming down bringing down the mind to this level and in that level you see whatever we read in the scriptures it is in the second grade first grade it is impossible no one can describe so in their coming down and then they are describing and all these descriptions it must be tallied with the other those who are practicing it in the future next generation and generation so that is called scientific way of understanding some of the times some religion they say only he can understand it and nobody else is wrong Jesus is the only physical son of God or whatever the experiences the Jesus has had only Jesus could add and nobody else because we're all singers wrong that is the reason we cannot go along with the Christianity why because that is not the scientific way of understanding if 1 plus 1 equal to 2 it will be everywhere the same it must be otherwise something know what even the practice is the Jesus deed if that has taken him to that height where he can see I am my father in heaven and one the same thing the same way seemingly I repeat if anyone can practice any time any malice must experience the same thing if not then in that formula there's something wrong obviously so thisis something nowadays in the modern time when you are sending the emails if you are missing one eye you don't go it will come back only one eye and I know what is wrong my computer is not working all these people not like that you must have done something wrong so once again you go back and then she and then only you see if you can type it properly it will surely out because the system is like this and the same way the spiritual life persuasion raghavan Sudama business daily why understand the man who was not happy at all evil why he is stating about himself and in so many pages he is dealing that I practice least I practice this I practice this and deserve the experiences I said like that to give us the confidence if you was practice you will have the same experiences if you practice it the same way you will have the same experiences I reveal it was revealed to me further that God himself has become the universe and all its living beings planes again this is Hinduism after practicing the knowledge practicing Tundra practicing the devotion it comes to that one and it says it was revealed to be farther God himself has become the universe and all its living beings and the 24 cosmic principles it is like the process of evolution and evolution evolution and involution the hindu never say that this is the god was created known the world was created universe was created by God no it is not it's an involution and evolution it Guzzi it comes out projection so that Swami ji said we do not know otherwise the problem would be the philosophical problem we I was first born I was not having any karma if I was not having any karma karma follow the result of karma so why stay suffer why should I be Bob whole in tourism the philosophy will crumble down on that the if you say that the world was created when so so so so here before okay but that time I came on we were husband they were manifesting first and and if it is the first time in the there was no murder so how it is that they are suffering some people are enjoying some people are suffering these there and you see that is according to the Karma that won't be possible so it is the God is creating and taking it back yet are you Navi society not the agent yet a subtler Purusha creation Omani they're giving the example that are optional some of the inhibition from the optional the very contradictory words they're using this option it never changes but the singing optional which is not getting any change anytime some of the omission from dad this world as he is manifesting if it is so that means it is changing again exist known how it is possible the God was alone that Eva Soler Edom of Grassi eaten Eve Adityan so mean the he was addressing a young boy oh dear one in the beginning there was only one ikan even a terrorist not to and from that one all these various things had come the Sunday when we were discussing the party bottom the same thing we were discussing in a different language in a different we did despite the same so this we are nothing but the war in person the God then why we can't feel literally a god why we are thinking the real limited because it has been superimposed on us that we are limited that's and nothing else so this is the way when again and again again and again you are telling someone that you cannot do anything you cannot do anything so after some time you say oh I can't do anything this is the problem so you have to understand these I am the son of God if you always think in this way I am pure I am having our power now it is not madness it is that self confidence so this whole world that we see beyond that beyond that body can say about that about that the consciousness is there we hope the consciousness nothing can move my body cannot know whether the consciousness otherwise it would you have all worked over here and if you don't people in India is all good if all the dead bodies are true mean here and there then why they're leaving we will go now the dead bodies and the leaving bodies what is the difference both our bodies what is the difference their consciousness one is having the consciousness another is not having the consciousness this is and what is that consciousness what is that consciousness that is the main idea and if we can understand that consciousness then you have solved a problem and how to solve that problem how to understand that consciousness three different paths three different systems three different practices according to your attitude according to your capacity your taste is been offered without the tundra and business so C Ramakrishna is telling I saw after that the God is everything and nothing else and I would seek God in meditation in the state of Samadhi and I would see the same God when my mind come back to the outer world this also needs your attention see the one word two two lines and so important I would seek God in meditation in the state of Samadhi that with Samadhi means when there's no difference only one consciousness is there and I would see the same God with my mind came back to the outer world when looking at this side of the mirror I see in blue and green I am looking on the reverse side up I saw the same God there is nothing but God and this is pure Madonna and nothing and nothing and nothing exists god so whom to criticize that sometimes some people whatever we discuss is nothing but a social condition but spiritual we are all saying that's why again and again with the be daunting the followers of Saddam additional American under we always say how we can criticize Christianity Islam Buddhism Judaism we cannot because we are the followers of a person a divine personality who has realized God in Samadhi and in the waiting stage in the waking state we see differences but you know the same God if you can see God by closing your eyes can't you see God with your open eyes you can you should and that is the ultimate religion and what is that God consciousness that consciousness I said just we were discussing without the consciousness this body is of no use the mind is a News so this is a consciousness alone and the devotees listen to these words with rapt attention then salam o krishna stealing he could understand the devotees to some extent scared the what had happened to us we can go to that father then is coming down and is talking to those students this they were sitting over there the devotees gods devotees have nothing to fear look at it he never mentioned krishna's devotees or Rama's devotees orthogonal he said God's devotees now who is God consciousness and what is the consciousness it can manifest anywhere in any form it can manifest anywhere in any form so obviously of course we need patanti when they talk about the god that God is the same consciousness [Music] reflected on Maya discovered same consciousness reflected on a home kara is a Jeeva individual souls we both are having the consciousness one is having a little consciousness on the ego and another and naturally suppose the huge form this our Michigan big when it is having the reflection of the Sun so many thousands of reflections everywhere everywhere you go and then a little girl playing with a little small water something she is carrying on that also a small - reflection of Sun is also there so that is cheaper Hartman we can say that and that is the issue but the reflection is not original so reflection of the consciousness of the Mayan sum total of ignorance is issue and reflection on a little ignorance honkala is Cagiva and he sees God's devotees have nothing to fear they are his own and he always stands by them through the great assurance because he knew the majority of us we won't be able to stand in this way I don't blame anyone I am the maker of my own distill that from he declared you are the maker of your own destiny from a different angle is a pedantic angle don't put your finger here and there the residual you have you the pedantic that strong mind the discrimination mister I need someone who I can go and impress who I can go and sit on the lab who will impress me and give me comfort I can say father I can say mother I can feel that there is some what we sticking care so that's like God and some Pistons telling God's devotees have nothing to fear why I have my father I have my mother anything I'm just learning to do and say that this is happening that is that me father would say no problem I don't take care of it the children are always very happy with to see the father and the mother nearby why because they know that they are there with it to be holy for our food for our children for everything they will take care so this way they are his own she understands fighting recently you have noticed a picture has been published and it has become bible in the internet world that a father and the daughter they were crossing a river I don't know where maybe in the Mexico somewhere they are coming to America and the father character daughter on her shoulder crossed the river actually trying to sit in this side so that he will go back and bring the mother came with some other maybe things but the little dog girl was terribly afraid to sitting alone there so when the father went to some extent she could not restrain she again started running towards reduce water and she was so little it was not possible so she jumped and then she wanted to reach the father and the father also tried to save her and both of them in the passed away and the picture they were describing is really pathetic that the girl she was putting the hand through the t-shirt of the father so that she can hold the sure the nick of the father tightly she wanted to get the safety where the father so the father and the mother if they are there the children on his will father is there he would of course the father tried produced a human both of them the perseverance even pathetic but anyway social and political situation so this it proves that we need someone the devotees need someone and that is God and God gives disasters the Mukerji brothers saluted the master the carriage was ready near the branda and north of the room the master stood facing the north on his left was the Ganges in front of him where the now birth and the God and whatever so these are the places those who have posited the Dutch nation can understand and they were doing and Saddam additional remains standing Salam Krishna save this world the gods devotees have nothing to fear now we find this picture when the devotees are going away from him to their respective places the God is quietly standing by the side of the holy river Ganga ravine standing as the carriage rolled away the devotees look back at the Masters waves being beaming with compassion and love the devotees of God and nothing to fear so if we accepted this long distance the God is always standing there to protect us now it's a Sunday description the mathematics giving is Sunday September 21st 1884 I will just pass those things then Saddam distance mentioning is a page 546 I was once taken to the Maidan matter is a very open the field here still the Calcutta and two-seater they will go up in those days that was the great thing at the 1780s so the balloon is going on there they noticed a young English boy leaning against a tree and his body paint in three places at once it at once brought before me the vision of Krishna now that he's describing those who are constantly remembering God what happens a little anything immediately the ignition as it immediately to be lighted the feeling of God he saw a English boy standing and a young boy you're standing living so the three places is the name and the waist and the knee the Krishna standing like this and the waist and the neck so three in this way so that's why we say Krishna is also known as three Congo Murari Murari three angle in three different places broken so the body is very soft and so the moment he saw that English boy he didn't see the boy he saw the God so that is the devotee the devotee will always see of ordinary things but that gives him the idea of God immediately he imagined that then the master is telling Radha had a team muhahaha these are all bow bow bow means mental condition one person is constantly one lady constantly says why the God is not riveting him to me I have not taken initiation does it mean without initiation I don't get it is not like that initiation is a process it smoothen the badass too but the main thing is love main thing is devotion and if you go on crying to God surely God will repeat but how no one knows the God is surely manifest but now if I go and tell her that everything is god it's difficult for hard to accept that so now the condition is God is separate God should come car should manifest before me and she is going on praying crying cry something old night she cried for God so like that is he is passing the days so I'm really if he's truly doing it I give you wondering so this is a real type of sadhana reactive of practice so this cinema Christians telling what happens for everything every moment everywhere the revelation will being of the God why mama Raja was having three Dada this of us having the muhabba what is the power Papa that mental condition and maja as a were sailing sometimes we use the word no harm to keep Rossi's this ultimate maha-prasada another takes on devastating so maha-prasada pressure demeans the sanctified food and Maharis very highly sanctified so this way the mahabhava the emotion are highly and that conditioning goes what is that she could not differentiate ourselves separate herself from please that is maja she could not separate herself from the krishna the mahabhava means i and death when I began thing is practicing and then in ultimately Bosley he theorizes that I am that hamsa AHA must miss oh haha wash me I am that I am that consciousness and there is no separation nothing else we can say is just like that we that particular aspect of God in Van Dyck I worship I concentrate I'd become that that is called the mahabhava there is no desire behind the aesthetic love of the gopis a true lover does not seek anything from God does not seek anything from God if there is any desire pain it won't come under this desire as a stories they say mahtim again now there was a desire in the mind of the brother that Krishna should be always with me and with nobody else he should be with me on you and the love is very generous so naturally the brother was thinking in that way that the Krishna never appeared before her and she searched everywhere with other rupees companies but without hard wife desire I only should have God and nobody else that is wrong thing so there is a desire the English world I should only realize God and nobody else night for sure no God appear before you so this way we have seen Aniston is very troublesome to process occurred power again is giving and and that one should be very very careful occurring power the moment we are trying to constraint that our mind what actually we do we consent in the nature the mind we're slowly slowly concentrating and we are focusing we are focusing on the danger and the power of the major assist very automatically comes those who are practicing the sadhana little bit of these and that obviously come but one should not practice religion only to anger that but many people do do it they are thinking if we can have this power that power activities in there then rich people will immediately come they will pay you money and then we purchase that power and ultimately you'd be again going back to the square one so that's only one must be very very careful he's stating that one shot whoever resists if that power and he was very happy were City then wonder that God came in the form the old man just to test him and say I know that you had tremendous power can you tell suddenly in the gentleman an elephant was fasting he said can till visit his mind and say yes as possible so he took a little dust artisan mantra through it and the elephant Delta did then the natural again that the old man God in the form of the world man say can you give me the life back to the once again he did hear a common trend for the - elephant again came back to life then the old man say elephant died and in it and again came back to life what happened to you what happened to you you are only thinking that oh I have the power to kill that God to give the light but now the question is gone so he says do you feel uplifted by it do you feel uplifted by it has he enable you to realize God saying these the Lord vanished so these two lines I only read and this is very important I am doing this I'm doing that I have the power I have these that so many but are you elevated by that have you realized God and what is that God realized unselfishness love and unselfishness and there should not have any any desire selfish desire the desire for the others oh please get in love as Jesus explained Oh God forgive but they do not know what they do the desire the god bless them this is the desire shall first started organi salvo hadron her shadow let everyone be free from the misery let everyone have enjoyment at all this this is the player this is not desire so this way if we can then finally salon business statement which we took as a subject of discussion today certain of the ways of Dharma subtle the ways of Dharma various sometimes some people they can't still the practice almost when they are reaching then some type of craziness will come they start doing these they start doing there sometimes some people they live alone and by being there they feel I represent in Canada rather cows they don't understand that they think I'm fine I don't talk to anybody I don't mix with anybody I have no feeling for immunity like this like this world they don't understand they're stuck in dead so god realization means the manifestation of unselfishness and the love that should be there otherwise it is known to Saddam occasionally it trail it cannot pass through the eye of a needle if it has the smallest fiber sticking out a very very difficult part to denies God but it is difficult not impossible it is possible why because so many people they are already realized and that proves that it is possible Thank You friends thank you for coming this evening let us conclude over here today and [Music] on da gamba become free shower but the Shaundi hurry that's young Krishna but my stew [Music]
