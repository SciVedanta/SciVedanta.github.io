[105. Panchama Veda 105: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqV6lhMGzg)

let us begin with that preneur mont de Vaca tom written top TG venom go BVD written cal muharram servin among golem srimad artem booby gu nan de bourree dodging aha now in 259 page of the Gospel of Saddam Oh Krishna translated by English by shaman aquiline under G from the original Bengali ceramic is Nakata Morita we find him the recorder is asking I haven't much faith in rebirth and inherited tendencies will that in any way injure my devotion to God now he is asking this question rebirth means punar janma we know that is the main basis of Hinduism and again inherited tendencies some SCARA we again and again say because punar janma and samskaara are attached punar janma rebirth why because of the samskaara inherited tendency so this inherited tendency comes from birth after birth and it takes us to this different type of births master ma che he is mentioning this having received an English education he is mentioning about himself having received an English education he did not believe in the tendencies inherited from previous births now this is the different type of Education and the idea that is coming and naturally the mind is thinking all the teachings of the way the the bhagavad-gita and the traditions is it all nothing so the master ma che is mentioning why suddenly he is asking this question because it has come from the background of this education English education they are not believing in this so when he is asking these ceramic is 'no answer is very clear he said master he was mentioning I haven't weighed sadhana Krishna he is giving the answer it is enough to believe that all is possible in God's creation you have to have this faith all is possible in God's creation never allow the thought to cross your mind that your ideas are the only true ones and that those of others are false now comes the faith then naturally people will immediately say why should I have to have this faith have to believe as because see Ramakrishna is telling should I have to believe it so here this question should I have to have the faith or believe us because see Ramakrishna is telling or somebody is telling or the scripture is telling we orders this picture written by composed by some of the Rishi's or some people why should I have to believe it but we should have to have something on the basis of which we can inquire we can go forward we can then no and then Hinduism constantly inspiring for the realization you must know yourself so solano Krishna is telling don't think that this is the end of it you cannot say the knowledge is complete knowledge so we can go further since you were thinking that rebirth and the samskara inherent tendencies I don't believe okay but don't think those who are believing there are fools so that is the idea then God will explain everything Salam o Krishna the god himself he's linked God will explain everything time will come everyone will understand it this is the uniqueness never condemning never killing them or burning them always waiting so that knowledge will dawn God will and now what can him an understand of God's activities the the physics of God's creation are infinite I do not try to understand God's actions at all he is talking about himself I have heard that everything is possible in God's creation I have heart from whom from the scripture that last Friday Saturday Sunday we were having the retreat on the brahmasutra one of the shooter one of the mantra is sastra you only thought this Shastra is the main source from the Shastra means those who have realized they are telling the truth they are telling their experiences that is very Shastra not all the statements not all the writings are the Shastras Shastra is only those which has been saved mentioned by the realized souls so that is important and here ceramic Easton's telling I heard I do not try to understand God's actions at all I have heard that everything is possible in God's creation I always be at that in mind suppose we do not then where we are constantly confused whatever we see we cannot explain there are many many things are there we cannot explain so we are totally confused so disbelieving constantly so in English they say doubting Thomas whenever we are disbelieving doubting where is the end of it the doubting disbelieving cannot take us anywhere so have some pieces on the basis of that then go forward and it says therefore I do not give it thought to the world but meditate on God alone and that is the source this is the hints for those who loves to develop their spiritual life when you understand that these are the things world it has so many other things excuse me what is having so many things so many varieties but these varieties are changing so naturally this cannot be the permanent so whenever there is something changing there must be something permanent comparing it that permanent we can think that these are changing so ultimate permanent thing we call it God or Brahman or Atman or Paramatma or Jehovah whatever that is permanent thing see Ramakrishna he is telling I do not give the mind to the world I always meditate on God giving the mind putting the mind just thinking about it but meditation means concentrating my thought on God now we find that in the bhagavad-gita chapter 4 sloka 5 it says biruni me batty tani John Monnett of Oh Georgina Tanya jambe the ceremony not one bit the abhorrent Appa he's using the word Quran tougher to explain the Arjuna is a famous hero parantapa his tapa the moment he goes before the enemies they feel the warmth of here the Arjuna is so famous in war so obviously Arjuna though you are very famous you are very powerful you're a very famous warrior even then you do not know but I and you again and again took birth many of the birth that have been passed by me and you this is the Krishna very clearly in the bhagavad-gita Reba we are also not only the Arjuna we also take birth again and again but we do not remember that Krishna is telling I know them all you do not so that is the difference between the God and the Jeeva God and the ordinary being we are born because of our work karma kala then again another because of the work what is that work through action that we are doing and through thought that you are doing all those things are accumulating that means impression that means the samskara that means the inherited tendencies the wind we are taking birth ayah was born in a family all of us in different families in different situations and different places why accident no it must have been something somewhere it was there and that is the reason we were taking birth in here and there so this we are taking birth we are born because of our tendencies and we're from the tendencies came from the Karma so karma and his reactions his father is going on and on and that is why these morality we have to practice high moral values and from the moral values to spirituality and the spirituality then only we can go beyond this circle so that's where Krishna stilling I am you are taking birth again and again but being a god myself I can remember it why he can remember because he is coming taking the form out of his own wheel in next local says the chapter fourth in the sixth number it says audio peas and neva Atma Bhutan are mr. Robeson proctor teams are modest are some baba art pneumonia some baba me art no my eye on this is the difference between God and us this is the difference between the incarnation of and us the last time we were discussing about the Incarnation now what is the incarnation the God the God is taking human form or many other forms whatever forms in whatever situation he wants to take he takes so this is a Joe Pisan of art ma is very clear Raja means unborn he never takes birth unborn a birth a boy Atma means changeless nature here the Atma means the nature and a booming changeless he's same all through permanent so why we are talking about the temporary and the permanent because that without the permanent we cannot see the changes suppose we go to the movie and there if there is no that screen white screen or white wall or something that is permanent on which the photos and all the pictures are going and showing that moving movie moving on which something permanent and because of that permanent thing we can see all the movements if the wall is also moving pictures are also moving we are also moving who will see what so that is the main thing something permanent and that parent is God and that he is mentioning do I am unborn and changeless and also the Lord of the universe Oh Joe peace and ABBA Atma bhutanam is shallow Pisan butanna means all the beings Ishwara I am the Lord and the Creator Lord means I am the Creator but I create myself yet using my own Maya subjugating my prakruti I come into being as if born as if Shankar Acharya in his explanation the bhagavad-gita he is telling yes God is coming what is taking birth how has if it is not true.really but as if this has if is very very important Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna he's having a throat cancer his body totally macerated it he cannot take turn on the bed it needs people to turn him then suddenly one day mass or the money they be found the she he is jumping running down to the stairs and then crossing the field again coming back climbing the stairs and lying down on the bed that very man then when she came and expressed you could you do that then he said don't tell others you know the incident in the life of Sri Ramakrishna the can we not say that he is God because he was having that capacity all those things are extra external just to show that I am also just ordinary like you even then in that excruciating pain I can keep my mine on guard if you practice if you can do that you also can be totally free from the bondage so this is very important Shami we become the was having the diabetes and Serrano Krishna cancer visit the two major diseases in the modern the society but still both of them always continuously without fail always keeping their mind on the higher plane of God to show that this is possible though the body is suffering I am NOT so that was the idea and he said and this is the proof of rebirth this is the Shastra yoni the Shastra is giving the verdict that is rebirth now the question is why why he is taking birth it says again in the bhagavad-gita paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya cha discrete on Dharma some stuff on our tire some Baba me you hey yogi and that is why Hindu never said this is the last a Bottari Hindi will never say that if anyone is telling this is the last person he is not Hindu but if you see the other religions they say this is the last one this is the only one they stop there but we say no again and again God is coming and he can take birth anywhere because because of his power because of his will and why he is coming again and again Dharma is almost upon our tire to stablish the righteousness to stablish the religion the word Dharma cannot be exactly translated into as in the English word religion possible but anyway right now we have to use the word religion to establish religion that must happen our tire he is coming and then he's telling paritranaya sadhunam but the protection of the good vinyasa IATA discrete arm and for the destruction of the weekend for the stablishment of the dharma i the god come into being in every age now the question is God is creating good people God again creating the bad people then why all this who has created the good people good talk good idea who God and then the bad God again and there's always some of the philosophy they are confused about this God is only for the good then who created the bed so they thought and then they evolved an idea that is Shaitaan they will like that some somebody else risk it cannot be the God all bad thing God no it is not possible it is he only the bad person who is that Shaitaan and then they imagine the two horns one tail is coming all this but if that being is they're parallel to God then there are two beings and along with the God it is also permanent along with the god comparing with the god it is also having lot of power then if there is - there is conflict and when there is a conflict as a destruction so Hindus are clear enough because realization is not only thinking when we think the philosophy we write there may be some mistakes particularly in religion but when we are realizing the thing going over there seeing for ourselves and coming back and reporting that will be perfect so the Hindus that our avataras our Rishi's after visiting that blessed state coming back and giving us the perfect statements what is that from God only did the bad things of the mean and again from the God only the good things are also coming so obviously these are the that's why see Ramakrishna said can one even understand the work of God that is the topic that mainly we are discussing today can one ever understand the work of God and ceramic is not also said don't try to you'll be wasting your time you are you can contain a little but when there is the Lord what you will do you cannot think of anything so this is the again the big question why and the answer is can one ever understand the work of God then he mentioned Balarama did not realize Krishna as God Balarama was his brother Krishna's elder brother Balarama and it was basu deep and Rohini Basu day he was the father of Krishna near as having two queens one is Rohini and other is Devaki since Rohini son is Balarama and a bogie son is Krishna and here the Rohini son Balam they grew up together they live together but he couldn't understand the Krishna was God himself though they were there together so that is called Mahamaya that is called the wonderful example of God's covering power he is covering the whole thing one of the direct desires Ramakrishna's disciple householder disciple used to go to Maseru Domini Devi enjoy Ambati and one day he said to mother's brother you this sister is not an ordinary lady you go and request to heart give me the emancipation Mukti my sister is a baby you say no no it cannot be they born over here you grew up together I know her very well she is my sister very good but how she can be the goddess then he told you are a fool I'm telling you go and simply say this pray and if he say she says yes then you are really blessed you will be taught immediately freed from all these bondages then he went over there and said didi didi means elder sister he is telling that you are goddess immediately the Mahamaya ourself she told the mother say who said they believed like that you are my brother that's all so total confusion even though they were so close and suppose he understood and went over there and now people are coming from faraway places they staying over there serving the Holy Mother the divine mother praying to heart meditating on heart getting the blessings and getting the emancipation look T but the way near and dear people they were there with her they couldn't understand it the that is why Saddam Oh Krishna can one even understand the work of God those who are very far they are coming and understanding and becoming the blessed one but those who are so close they do not understand how you can explain these so this Balarama though he was the brother of Krishna could not understand Mahabharat Adi barber there the Bosch today he has very clearly mentioned who is Krishna oh no clue heart omluke Arnim Vishnu loca nama screechy Vishnu who Vishnu the word vishnu means be star 80 vishnu ho everywhere he or dad which is everywhere can it be and only one person know is the consciousness the consciousness which is everywhere that Vishnu and his very famous loca nama scriptura he everyone the whole universe is paying respect to him that Vishnu is coming as if coming down into his own creation taking a human form why oh no clue her tongue Loken arm to place the people he is coming in the human form it's just like teacher he is creating the question paper taking the exam but before creating the questions forming the questions is teaching he is telling that these are the important points stones you must remember those who are intelligent they are remembering noting then in the exam time that similarly God is creating us God is giving us the good thoughts the good people and again and again asking us he himself is coming in the form of a human being a Bottari in acting just like a human being and showing us inspiring us guiding us be good good and good follow this path but if we don't then we are suffering because God has created the boat then he is guiding us also so here it says a new crew harem lokan arm bar shoot a bar today become producer Maharaja Shara that famous one Maharaja shahe the famous one brother Bhutto he is as if certainly creating himself how Vasudeva to Devaki and Vasudeva and Devaki son but actually he is an RD needin a diva on Adi Adi donna diva his owner rd he as you cannot find when he was born on RD is eternal so that is why and you cannot kill him also it is he has no beginning and he has no end on our dianna donna diva sub carta is the master jaga prabhu who he is the master of the whole universe and why he is coming again Dharma semester burn our tire he's taking the birth in the clan of Brittany show the in the clan of the Brittany he is taking the form of the whole that Vishnu in the form of Krishna the same Vishnu is coming in the modern world as here on occasion we know that the story again that same Vishnu in his dream the father of ceramic is now the Vishnu is telling I like to come as your son and he is taking the form as Shri Ramakrishna in this modern age he is again and again asking us only a few things go and listen to the holy words sadhu sanga and return into a solitude wander over those thoughts Neeraj and Barza and then discriminate good and bad what is good and what is bad this long life that I have lived what I have done and what I have God and that is why the spiritual retreats and listen until we go and listen and try to leave like that will never be get that piece again and again we have to come back and have to suffer that is not the life that the human soul should do because it is the wonderful life that we have God the human birth we have the capacity to think we have the quality to discriminate even then if we are not utilizing these excellent qualities so Atma ha Shankar Acharya in his book he said as if he is committing suicide this is very very important so the ramakrishna mission always going on harping on this thought and shri ramakrishna created a group of dedicated people there sannyasins also inspired householders they were living in the household in the society like ordinary people but their whole mind and soul was dedicated to God all their karma the action that they are doing remembering the God's words again and again so the world is getting the transform then again the both the people they're coming together and praying to God serving the God and only for the blessings of the God karma yoga and that's why the motto of the ramakrishna mission afterwards officially formed an organization by ceramic richness very favorite disciples swami vivekananda ramakrishna mission what is that motto this belong to society what is the motor Atman emoji artem jagat a taya cha all that we are reading is for the Atma moksha when a monk who he is giving the classes he is reading he is pondering he is meditating he is trying to explain in his own way at mimosa for his own liberation and again for the betterment of the others we go to different houses we talk about this when we are talking we are reminding ourselves again and again and at the same time some of the people they are getting the fire and immediately they are utilizing that and that is why Dharma semester burn our tire that same God coming to stablish the Dharma what is the Dharma the Dharma is to understand I am God but what is the problem God has covered all with his Maya again see Ramakrishna is giving the answer what is the problem why can't we realize the God we can understand so many things why can't you understand God who is so close to us with within us with with our own self if that is so what is the problem cinema Krishna is explaining God has covered all with his Maya he doesn't let us know anything Maya is what is that Maya his desire is the last and the gold we are constantly having desire desire and to fulfill that desire wealth just I think today I saw the report from near to Bombay you can fly one ticket one-way 38,000 American dollar and why that they are doing it because there are customers so how they are going in two three rooms they are having private rooms bedrooms and all these and after 18 hours or 20 hour sighting 18 hours flight you are reaching to Bombay and you have paid a huge money but when you are getting down from your back from your front other people sitting down in the same place maybe they have purchased the same ticket in $1000 the duration and what is the comfort no not much comfort but the ego is satisfied the ego ease I am getting into the fluff light first I am getting down from the flight first and in mind that apartment nobody is there so these are said that's why all this is maya maya and mire little bit of comfort is necessary those who are busy businessmen they need it and other professionals they need it but at the same time why too much that's why the desire and the wealth this is the maya the first thing is the desire ceramic is near stealing he who puts Maya aside to see God can see him this is the clear statement putting away the Maya all that is happening connecting it the me and mine connecting with my ego is Maya that is very peculiar all that is happening connecting with my ego is Maya sometimes some people are praying Oh God please give me some these and that they're getting it very easily why God is very happy the game will continue the moment you are asking for many other things in the world which are temporary which will never take you to God you will be immediately we all your prayers will be answered and he will get those things mostly why again the Maya this creation God has created and he wants to have this play continue and that is the reason once when I was explaining God's action to someone God suddenly showed me the land lake at Khmer poke or I saw a man removing the green scum and drinking the water the water was clear as crystal God revealed to me that searched on undiscovered by the scam of Maya and he who puts the green scum aside can drink the water in the small that ditch that we have over here this for accumulating the water and all that is also covered we are trying to remove but just like the Maya every time it is coming and covering we tried more so much its similarly our mind is a pawn covered with Maya and in that Maya I in every ripples is high and Saddam occasion is telling I saw God showed me that this is the way it works let me tell you a very secret experience once I had entered the wood near the Pine Grove and was sitting there in the dictionary still the small patch is there though you not a lot of population and all in the name of modernity in the name of all this that original thing has been removed to make things clear to the people everyone can go that is the wrong conception anyway let me tell you the secret experience once I had entered the wood knee of the pine grove and we were sitting there when I had a vision of something like a hidden door of a chamber hidden door of a chamber I couldn't see the inside of the chamber I tried to board a hole in the door with the nail knife but did not succeed as a board the art fell back into the hole and filled it then suddenly I made a very big opening uttering these words the master remained silent after a time he said these are very profound words I feel as if someone were pressing my mouth I have seen with my own eyes that God dwells even in the sexual organs I saw him once the universe is conscious on account of the consciousness of God sometimes I find that this consciousness wriggles about as it were even in small fish the carriage came to the crossing of Shabab Roger in Calcutta the master continued saying times I find that the universe is saturated with the consciousness of God as the art is soaked with water in the rainy season well I see so many visions but I never feel vain about them he is explaining that each and everything is nothing but the consciousness the life of ceramic esna is the complete book of Hinduism in Hinduism we find that thousands and millions are worshipping the personal gods and goddesses but at the same time the same Hindu he is going to the other temples and paying respect why because the Hindu nose is very well the same consciousness which has taken the form of his own God our God is his own the prayer has taken the form the same consciousness is present everywhere the ceramic ISNA is telling this he wanted to tell us the world people that this is God but he couldn't someone is pressing his mouth why this is direct experience and you cannot get it from anywhere except your own experience you cannot explain God which is Brahman which is all-pervading the moment you are in a position to explain this says God the God is limited anything that is limited cannot be infinite and which is not infinite cannot be permanent so that is the reason he is telling and he said that I found the whole universe saturated with the consciousness that is his experience he was the Kali Poojari many of the people even mentioned even today as a Poojari of the kali without understanding the Kali Pahadi was having this wonderful experience and experience all the time all the moment every moment in his life the God is everywhere that is the highest that condition a higher state of mind that is called Jeevan Muktha leaving at the same time totally free from all bondage --is all ignorance that is called Jeevan Muktha condition M he stilling once there once lived a man in Greece M means the master Mercia he is not mentioning there once lived a man in Greece his name was Socrates a voice from heaven said that he was wise among men the Socrates was amazed at this revelation he meditated on it a long time in solitude and then realized its significance he said to his friends I alone of all people have understood that I do not know anything I alone of all people have understood that I do not know anything but every man believes he is wise in reality all are ignorant the master Masha is mentioning from some of the books Socrates we know that that Greek philosopher then they forced him to drink the poison and he had to kill himself because of the truths that he was revealing the Socrates he is telling I do not know that I understood and this is the wonderful way of expressing that I have understood that I am NOT this I connected with this body and mind that is the eye and in the open he should also the same way it says the master now and then I think what is it I know that makes so many people come to me sometimes now and then I think what is it I know that makes so many people come to me he was not educated in that way but people in great number used to come to him this to see that his field did to listen to him what is that that he himself is wondering and he's telling Vishnu Puran was a great pundit he used to say to me I can find in the scriptures all the things you talk about but do you know why I come to you I come to hear them from your mouth Vishnu Puran was a great scholar all these things that the salam o krishna is telling it is available in the scripture and anyone can purchase the book and read it but why do they come to those holy people because the practice that that is the difference in every universities there are hundreds of scholars on these scriptures and the philosophy they are teaching philosophy but why people come to the mouth because they practice it that is the difference the position of Turin is coming to see Ramakrishna why these words when coming it out from Ramakrishna it carries the real meaning of it and that is why he says all your words tell you with the scriptures aim the master Mercy is telling why they are telling like this vaishnav jaren master Marche Salaam Krishna never read any Scripture we can quote from the bhagavad-gita bhagavata and then many other scriptures Upanishads Salaam Krishna never memorized those things he never ate those things but whatever he's saying that tallied with those why realization and that proves the scriptures are true because the realization of the Serrano Krishna who never went through those books naturally his mind was not conditioned was not having any impression of those ideas but the same truth revealed in that mind and that is why when they say that the beta or Perot Shia it has not been created by some intellectual person from his own intellect it is true Salaam Krishna's life proved the whole Hinduism that is the speciality that's why I always called this book this gospel of ceramic is nur as the Pentium of Eila is the fifth Veda is a containing containing all the knowledge not only knowledge is also the experience all those knowledge coming out expressing in the life of ceramic is not master Masha is telling all your words tell you with the scriptures nobody Goswami also said that the other day at the festival of pani RT you told us that day that by repeating the word gita a number of time one reverses it and it becomes soggy which refers to the renunciation renunciation is the essence of the dita now that the goswami supported your statement from the grammatical standpoint from the grammatical standpoint also with the whole gita the teaching of gita renunciation and nothing else the only one simple word renunciation tyaga the cinema krishna realized it and he expressed in his simple way and that has been supported by all the great scholars grammarians and that is the power of God and cinema Krishna that is why even the Jatin Amma Prabhu he was a great scholar Shankar Acharya was a great scholar Ramanuja madhu Acharya they were all great scholars and all that we see they were either the prince of the scholars except see Ramakrishna he was a poor Brahmin he was not having any idea of all these things but when he himself realized and expressed the whole world they started thinking how it is possible you can remember we have read in the beginning this master marsha this three more Mandana gupta he himself was commenting and was asking a maidservant does he read lot of books and that maidservant said no it is everything in his own mouth whatever he thinks immediately it comes out as the true as a book and this is called Veda this is called knowledge not depending on anything when we are reading something we are developing an impression about it and he never dreamed in our thoughts that may reflect and that cannot be said as revelation there's a reflection because we thought we heart and a ceramic isness life how it came because he was going on concentrating meditating brightening his mind withdrawing his mind from all the objects st. st. st. objects and then he revealed all the truth that collaborated with all the statements of the scripture he saw us Semiramis our album yet kimchi agathiyar yogurt the fast parts of the fish open assured that we are studying now in our Sunday classes that everything is nothing but the God it is situated in each and every point God is present so dad ceramic is not stealing I saw that consciousness saturated everywhere and this is the master Masha is telling then ceramic richness telling have you found anything else remembering resembling me any pundit or holy man he's incredible he's asking the master ma che have you seen anyone that can be symbol to me sometimes some people they say these on that one I told it's good a little portion of light as it is now come but when we have got the Sun itself when I have seen the Sun itself why should I go to the lamp I go to the Sun so that's why I always from distance offer my pranaam and respect and see your Blissett because at least you could light a candle or maybe a little more light but my target is the Sun and I will go to the Sun and nothing else so that is why the ceramic isne have you found anyone else resembling me any pundit or holy man master marcher he is giving the answer God has created you with his own hands as best as possible master MA she is trying to give the answer he is telling in his own hands whereas he has made others by machine all others he has created according to law Salameh Krishna laughing to romulan and others there was listen to what he is saying same question was axed by Vasudeva to Narada you remember in the Ramayana in the beginning perfect personality the Vasudeva is asking Narada as because you travel everywhere you have seen so many people you have a great knowledge you never forget can you please tell me is there anyone perfect in everything you have we have already explained and we will be again talking about Indian Ramayana and then the Narada gave the descriptions of Rama Chandra Sri Ramachandra who was again the incarnation of the Lord Vishnu do not think from the point of view of Advaita Vedanta from the point of view others philosophy is from the totally devotional point of view of the Hindus when we believe where we believe that Vishnu is the sustainer reminds the Creator Vishnu is the sustainer and it is the creation that is having different type of things and to sustain that to make people always good writers traveling towards the God the holiness the fulfilling us they must follow these are the things and that's why God is coming again and again in different form and we know that the Shabbat era and the last one is Rama Chandra afterwards again the same Avatara same God same Vishnu as Krishna and then in the modern days see Ramakrishna and since Saddam Oh Krishna himself declared the very humble man who neighbors said about him no neighbour propagated about our team never pronounced anything about him he is telling to his very beloved disciple who was doubting him and when when see Ramakrishna was dying he was on his deathbed then this young man he was the representative of the modern day society constantly doubting asking question he was thinking at this condition in this condition if this man can say that I am God when he was thinking the Narendra not afterwards Tommy Vivekananda when he was thinking in this way immediately see Ramakrishna replied it is written over there in our Shaban and 'adam very nicely with this Ramakrishna's picture he who was Rama he who was Krishna again in this age as Ramakrishna that this is the ceramic Krishna who is guiding us and there is no narrowness anyone who was sincere in spiritual pursuit wants to develop the spiritual qualities must read this book must ponder must meditate on the words of ceramic rish now and today we have learned that God is everywhere the God has created this universe and the god gain coming taking the human form to guide the human being and we can never fathom his work thank you very much there is our our prana mantra - vagabond see ramakrishna and conclude needin general
