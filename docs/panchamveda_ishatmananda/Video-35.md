[36: Panchama Veda 36: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKMM4lI6p3g)

now let us begin our discussion by chanting foreign the words of god we purify our thoughts so that is the reason one must go on again and again this was very simple and in a conversation the but slowly slowly it improves our teacher the writer in this book or sometimes on his birthday he is mentioning some things and then coming back home without doing anything against and they all say yes is perfect questions is which can be the answer of all conflicts that we see in today's world what is that he are is i'm not giving you the details but the gist of the answer is god can be realized through all paths look at it realization and the religion no this is the first time someone told it this is the uniqueness so he is combining everything you need to accept somebody else's the moment you listen to this think about the this the word means god and brought the word to accept that whatever the cause if you really have the sincerity huge image tremendous power physical they're sharing it but at the same time spiritual power mental power power taken together as god the same way we'll be looking at the image of the nation and they will shrink my god this is the teaching special teaching this is the only teaching that can bring peace though it has been translated but the people who are is he is a wonderful conversation on 24th august of 1882. first is another he was very famous afterwards that she became a man of course in those days almost physically there is and found then slowly slowly is is not necessary the more he grows in his own strength the children the father similarly god can give us any moment here's negativities all this maya time he was to always that we are understanding his advices properly and then receiving what are the advices we will listen to he was telling that the torso is india you are free to do whatever you like you have some extra medicine you just go and distribute amount if you have the headache this is my exercise immediately these are the problems they don't depend on others that is the psychology of the whole western mind we have to understand and appreciate there are people suffering but at the same time all general systems are there so those things now they come and tell you so africans but at the same time all the different organizations are coming forward but through this helping through this philanthropic world we can reach foreign this is the symbol of spirituality the moment you feel love for others the symbol of spirituality when you feel love for each and every one you are thinking a little spiritual discipline is necessary in order to know what lies within a little spiritual discipline the way you speak so simple the people they know this is nothing if you go and read the uh this and after that you have to go complete nine years uh your control over your mind your anger your passions is these are these are the sensitive words and admit for example if a weight is placed on one side the lower knee moves away from the upper body if you see that particularly now independently better because the balances are different now previously it was like this in a school in our law department the symbol is the lady even having consists of that lady also hold it and then she is holding a scale the equal and she is holding her eye because she is not seeing or like discriminating this is the symbol this case if anything is in one then other goes away if you put something somebody said sometimes always absorb itself we are alert what type of questions they are asking all the talk is going on but at the same time part of my mind is always there to come so this is is but at the same time master perform your duties in an unsufficient spirit here is the technique for the householders they must have to go out is every and so many things every day human beings he has helped and then he has the society in an and that is we always expect that we will get his attention just i joined as a knowledge asked me smoking the immediately go down sometimes nearly 100 200 so sometimes i have to get out and walk so that the enough can understand the reflection of the nothing how much i suffered yesterday not a single sentence about that another emotion and then afterwards he said tell me one thing you were waiting to get the party before all other special say who this boy but if you believe that you are praying for the god believe that god has two do he taught me all through my life duties in an unselfish state i can remember one sentence can you be like the father who constructed a huge category church and when the king and received and they say you have to leave that today sir and we hand over all your church and responsibility to the next man who is late without any question so he was standing by the side of the president otherwise you are going to be a problem for yourself before the organizations so that is the dream totally don't incite it to god i know everything is we have to understand that god is living in every human being and at the same time you have to understand i am serving the god in the human being who is not due to appreciate me like this rather than being the reason when people are appreciating laughing praising okay people are not appreciating criticizing all the problems but that is you should not renounce everything you should do only otherwise you are not otherwise yourself rather bless me so that i can be successful and that way this so this is the way we have to then master russia is actually said but may i know if one can realize god by performing one's duty can drama and desire co-exist look at it there are so many many people explaining our scriptures but the practical reply has been given that's the offices the parents are disturbed sometimes i hear their mindful son i don't know what he's doing only three months and now he has changed and slowly he becomes with that he becomes a family people like that he will be spending the whole life in that operation and here always they will develop their own capacity and send their from it so nowadays they call it professionals no attachment no emotional thing you give me the job of the job will be if i but in whatever process is not that i am taking all the benefit from this company and running the secret and then without accepting because just to survive they were doing that but mentally they are constantly praying to god and pray for the forgiveness so god listens to it only within your so this is the way all there is no way of renouncing work all there's a time a fraction of time you the life is full of joy after the retirement when you have no war particularly the only one the perfect work what is that you should join in the spiritual line and you'll be reading books taking the name of god singing you are visiting the temples at the holy places listening to this understanding was used as life and they are excited whole family came before the canada small candidates is so this of what is teaching us if you are following it you are happy then said may i make an effort to earn more money look at it he is asking the question may i make an effort to earn more money and he is giving the answer it is permissible to do so to maintain a religious family the words of religious family when you are maintaining your family in the proper manner that means you know how much you need as areas they are getting their money and they are learning the education they are getting education with your help so as maximum impossible but in a proper way people they become reunion within a few days then afterwards they go back to their legs so that too they are supposed to go up but after from the union then they will go to racks but whatever they have related they kept hidden here all the relatives will be enjoying the money behind the bar obliged when they are depending on you you must have to support them but when they can help themselves no problem himself he used to ask how this is for maintenance okay this much money will be sufficient for her even being god himself without he was very difficult for him to touch the money he never testified even then asked because he was a married person he was responsible for his wife so that's why he is telling how long a man should feel you know they're going to be most of their time is straight for paying why you have to do that you don't have any other thing moms are coming into your home they're staying with you and whenever you are afraid is so difficult so this is the way this next you need to worry about giving up giving away your duty it will drop off automatically the moment you develop the love for god so this will discuss in our next class let us conclude we're here to be offering our country way is foreign that's it i was thinking that it will change the time because nowadays the day is long at six o'clock it's all sunny everywhere we don't feel the
