[109: Panchama Veda 109](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4asAijqqCJQ)

good evening today we will discuss about the in brief of course the symbology symbology in particularly in Hinduism and before that as usual we will chant this mantra tavo khatam rhythm dr. G venom curvy very rhythm Cal mashaba home sravana mangalam srimad athim booby goonan te borre dodgin aha now here we are studying the gospel of sri ramakrishna and just completely again and again almost in every page lot of knowledge here we find in page 271 one gentleman nom govinda he is asking a question to advance a rama krishna revered sir why does the Divine Mother have a black complexion and here the Divine Mother means goddess Kali the obviously now this is a question that he is asking salam Krishna himself also asking the same question to aim asking do you know the meaning of the image of jagged are three meaning of the image of jagged daughtry those who know the Hinduism that we have the jagged are three more tea and Islam crystal is explaining but before that if we see we have to understand the symbology to understand Hinduism is a very ancient religion ancient culture so lot of symbolic things have developed to express wonderful ideas now the english word symbol has come from the greek word symbol on a sign by which one can understand or infer a thing sometimes i have noticed the singers of the musicians when they are not very much satisfied with the sound in the microphone they'll be looking at the person who is handling that microphone sometimes they are making like this that means make it much low or sometimes this let me they are showing to the finger is more higher and if you have seen if you have noticed the people sometimes when you have to complete it particularly in the army military will be showing at this type of sign that means cut complete this so all symbolism almost in everything almost in everything if you don't understand the symbol then it will be great problem so sometimes they'll be showing the army officer without telling it sound anything will be showing like this that means keep an eye on that watchful be very watchful if he shouts that we create problem so the symbol actually helping us to understand thing but we have to understand that if we don't understand the symbol that we won't be able to understand even sometimes the day cards and the bad people they are also using some symbol too dear followers they understand what they mean by that symbol they'll be telling these and there's Rami Sri Ramakrishna in one of his stories he is telling there is a shop and all p they are using the wrapper that all mentioning jai Ram Shriram acceptor etc outwardly the people in the sea or very holy people because they are using the wrapper full with the name of God and also different type of mars bar menial marks and all on their forehead etcetera apparently it looks that they are all religious people but running a shop the villagers they came they are doubtful in the city people are going to cheat them so when they saw this shop they were very happy oh these people are having all symbols of religion they must be very holy people so they entered now the person in the counter it turned to the manager and he told Keisha ba ki shava who are these actually he is uttering the name of God toshiba is there another name of Krishna but actually he is asking the manager who are these people would you think of them then he said Gopala Gopala deserves another name of God that but he is meaning as a coward all the cows they don't have any intellect that person again hurry hurry he is telling the name again of the god Krishna that means shall I rob them of cheat them then the manager giving the permission hora hora no problem the things goes in this way everything symbol and who is still in this ceramic ISNA so one must be very very clear to understand unless and until you understand the symbol you are going to be cheated by people like this so here is the symbol now national flag are the symbols of that particular nation if you have noticed the national flag of America it gives the history of America very clear those who have read the history every clear the cartoon strips 50 * and all this it looks so nice but actually it is speaking about the history of America but if you look at the national flag of India it speaks about the philosophy of India is the philosophy and the center there is a chakra there is a will there is called Dharma supposed to be followed by the nation now they are not some people are not very happy that they are not following Dharma in India but that may be but actually the our symbol it says we are supposed to and the three-color that speaks about the philosophy so that is the true the symbol we are understanding this the symbols are used in the transfer to transmit the culture also now someone the moment you see the Indian people when they see the senior they always fold their hands and they say numbers they nourish car etc folding the hands that means offering the respect it is a culture they are not going and shaking the hands they are not going and hugging they are not doing all those things but showing a great respect how by folding the hands and bowing a little before the person and that person also reciprocating that way almost the same thing why because we the person those who are doing it practicing it maybe they do not know why we are holding our hands but in reality the philosophies each soul is divine within the soul within that person the divinity is there the God is present ashura server bhutan arm arjuna dish to thee o Arjuna that God is reciting the heart of each and every being so they are offering pranaam that culture developed so it is the symbol actually the culture so this is the way if you go even today into the villages is the holy man the first thing they will do they will wash your feet and then they will offer pranaam to you why in those days people is to come walking the roads where muddy so the dust first thing you should watch the feed so that is the here also part dear argha and all those things are offered to God I am washing your feet I am giving you the flower tour decoration not everything is symbol symbol and symbol now the best symbol in Hinduism we find in the sandia are the evening Aarti if you go to any hindu temple you will find they are doing the RT how using only five things and if you notice carefully what are the things and it has a system one after another the first thing they are showing that is the light the fire the fire is a symbol of knowledge so first thing I want to know the fire but at the same time the symbol of punch a Buddha punch Omaha Buddha the elements what is that shitty upper stage Murugan boma shitty means this art the symbol of that art again is a flower opera is the water te Jay is a fire maruta the fan they will be doing like this so shitty oper t maruta and for that Akasha this occurs Amin space and this is showing is a small plot like this let's call arkasha so these are the five elements why every deviation to the GAR because we know only these five things are remaining I otherwise the nothing is there in this universe the maid of H and everything is made up despite things that's called puncher mo our water Mahama's great brutha means elements so this punch Omaha water is made of all now we are going to offer what shall I offer what can I offer everything is made of even so that is the reason we are taking those things and offering and telling what can I do because everything belongs to you part i'm using my love my respect my devotion sincerity all with this thing so this is the way the symbolic the symbolism in hinduism we find not only the Hinduism religious truth as because it is a very intelligible by nature has given rise to symbology even in the Christianity symbolism is there and it's called cross different varieties of crosses at the air non-christians do not know even the Christians do not know so many varieties of causes the moment we think about the cross you only think about the cross usually now there are so many varieties if it comes in the center there is a different meaning that's a different Church and the different group of people so obviously there are symbolism with that only little changes they're changing so this is Christianity wider cross the use because the sacrifice the great personality G this he did for the sake of the humanity he sacrificed his life so the symbol is we should also be like that for the betterment of the fellow being for the betterment of the human being we should also sacrificed that is the symbol Islam vehemently protest against the symbolism but took it over there the moment you try to give an idea about the Islam there is a crescent moon and star all is it is there that is the symbol even the flag color of the Islam is also speaking a great history so that is the symbolism goes like that but deism you will find as chakra it will what is that Dharma chakra the Dharma the religion the righteousness that is going on moving moving and moving that is the Buddhist and Hinduism mostly it gives wonderful ideas through the symbol and very famous symbol is shwat tick schwat occur is the symbol dough in the second world war the Germans they use the show optica of course in a different way but that Sh wat thicker means the son of the fire so obviously they are very powerful but that was the symbol of the German we are very powerful so utilize this rathika not in the Hindu fashion in the opposite direction they drew but that people we can scare the moment they see the symbol of shwat occur they are scared so the hindus reduced that if you have noticed between in a holy place when we are offering the puja we draw the schwab tika why the fire what is the fire purifies that is the symbol of fire every time anything the Hindus are going to perform they will light a lamp why it is a symbol what is a symbol light is a symbol of knowledge and everywhere the Hindus they will keep a feature and full of water at a time of puja and if you go to particularly the temples that is maintained by the people coming from the southern part of India they pune kumba are the conga okuma means a feature the half of it the water that will be used on the god or the full that will be the poor on the god the symbol of the Shiva that is also there each and every symbol after few months durga puja is coming a great festival with the Hindus so then the Durga if you find as a peculiar symbol the ladies sitting on the line and then he/she is having sometimes ten hands or eight hands or six hands and sometimes she is sitting on the tiger they call it sherawali that means the power terrible power animal power that is the tiger and that lion that has to be controlled completely what is that animal power desire and when the desire is not complete is not fulfilled then the anger all that is present in that animal a animal is there hidden in the human being so we have to control that how by imposing on that or manifesting on that that power a supreme divine power which is the power of the god and that is in the form of mother why mother because compassion because love so that is the symbol of compassion and love that is the Durga she is having teen hands the symbol of covering each and every corner of this universe dasha dekhe all places are covered by heart having so many weapons that was all powerful all pervading all powerful all knowledge she is having everything and then if you can please that goddess what he will get whatever you want Mukti liberation from this bondage that also she can give and them if you want to enjoy this world that also she is ready to give all symbol and that is the reason the water is a symbol ohm Cara is a symbol of the such a ton and the Brahman why oma when you pronounce Omaha to the sound Oh Matt is not eating the second thing any sound that we are making the tongue it is hitting inside the mouth something the palate or the lips both the lips then only the sound is coming but we used art of the word all Oh more you need not to heat anything both things are not necessary we doubt that one sound can be pronounced that is the symbol of such cheat on and the Brahma because Brahman is not taking the help of anything to manifest ramen is self manifesting so these are all the symbolism and the God is all-pervading though it is not moving at all but it is telling the very forceful it can reach anywhere much powerful than the mind mind which can travel much much higher than the light even then we the mind is defeated with a speed of the god speed of the Brahman speed of the art man why is already there so that is the reason so it says the jagannatha many times i told to our devotees over a year the jagannatha is not having the legs why he's jagannatha jagan means the universe not the master he is the master of this universe he is present everywhere you need not to he need not to go anywhere to present himself he's already there that is why jaganath is not having the legs only when the moment it is thinking immediately all works are done perform and that is the reason he's not having any hands that is the jagannatha in the Punishers also find the support of this today a jet eaten a jetty that dorito don t key tag intarsia sarebbe stata do service hacia byetta is a wonderful sloka in the phoenician it is there outside in the far it is near it inside it is outside everywhere saturated so these are all symbols and very special symbol ganesha small ganesha we are having over here most of the people never notice but Dhoni she is present and we call that Ganesha is a city data what is the city success if you want success you must have to worship the Ganesha and the Ganesha is having an elephant head why is a story again in every symbol at the back there is story but their story only to attract the mind of the people but at the back of that is a great philosophy what is that philosophy gonna means the moss is a huge everything Isha means God all that you see is nothing but the God if you can satisfy that if you can understand that if you can dedicate your mind to that then only success will come otherwise not so that is the we unnecessarily we are giving stressed on the story and there are different type of stories and in different provinces different people different time will be telling the same story in a different way and mostly we are confused which is one the correct nothing all the stories only to attract the minds of the people but if you are really sincere if you can understand this is the meaning of the Ganesha Ganesha is all powerful and what is that power knowledge or the power of the human being physical no knowledge why the elephant hate because of the hugeness the moment we think about an elephant is the huge big everything so big so vast each and everything is included in that if we go and see these now in the bhagavad-gita it says salvat aparna padam that sorry batok shishir overcome servatus suit among you okay etc very famous locust to all the heads that you see is me our eyes the hands the Li all being a nothing but me that is the way their expression is also symbol but difficult to understand so the images of jagannatha so the images of the Asia so this way the images are used now two types of symbols of their one is the form symbol in the form symbol is this the figures now when we go to the any temple we carry flower is obviously we are carrying the flower why the symbol of devotion the flower is the symbol of devotion we always carry when you go for the knowledge we carry the fire the symbol of knowledge is fire so this is the devotion is the Lotus that is why the Lotus is a symbol again in the Buddhism dough is all based on the knowledge but you should be devoted to the knowledge and what is that knowledge that Brahman is everywhere you should be devoted to that knowledge then only you will understand so this is the symbol the form is there you know that rata yatra is a great ceremony and the hindus millions of people will gather in the state particularly orisha and in many places they do here in America also i went to you that one place they were also pulling on rata small daughter they were doing that what is it doctor yatra is also again a symbol and that symbol is the body human body and that is the Rutter within that rather the chariot within that is sitting enshrine the art Minh the God the supreme it is there so these are the symbolic very very symbolic autumn onam rotten Umbra t-they begins in that way in the punisher sometimes again we will read that in details and it says that if you have the control of the mind then only you can run the chariot properly because all your inner ears are the higher I amines the horses very powerful all the five indriyas arjuna that symbol that rathod we see five horses is all again the symbolic or five sense organs of knowledge decide the year the nose the tongue and the skein that is the symbol Chuck shuker no nausicaa Jovetic in sanskrit it says a puncher hyah hyah means the horses the five horses it needs it wonderful person to control it otherwise it is very difficult one who can control it can run it properly and can reach the destination without any accident or otherwise the mind will take here and there create a lot of problem shreeram or at amoeba to Hartman am sorry damn BTW art mononym that is inside the chariot is there and sharee demerit amoeba to this human body is the data that is the chariot booting tashara theme BTW is the chariot he is the holding the reins and his running would d is not the mana is the booty and would be that decisive faculty decisive faculty of the mind is the good thing and one can take the decision in the proper time then only it can go I have just driven remembering a funny story one person came and he was actually presenting a small group of people they were wealthy they were very strong physically but they were telling we are not respected in the human society because we are not having that intellect the birthday we have to find out someone who will teach us with thee so the selected a person from among them was considered as a most intelligent he came to a city and when he got down him unfortunately or fortunately met a person he said hey who are you why you are going here and there so sir I am coming from that village I have traveled all through the night I want to search a master we will teach me what is the intelligence what is they've called would they say you are lucky that in the morning you have met me I can teach you I am the most intelligent person in this city but you have to pay for this it was no problem we have lot of money i can give you so what is this their cds are here is an iron pillar was there he kept his hand were there and said you punch on this is no problem and the village man physically strong he said do you really mean it can I punch on your hand no problem user all force Hemi give the function immediately he took out the hand naturally he was eating the iron and he was feeling a lot of pain is that this is called booty this is called the intelligence you have to perform that particular action in a proper way the proper time it was correct this man came back to the village and called all people there is a great gathering and he said I need one steel frame a pillar in the village suddenly how can you find out they are still peeler I'll ok ok anything nearby he couldn't find anything then he said okay I want to volunteer come over here a volunteer came he kept his hand on his nose and the things repeated but he was bleeding things where everything was already removed the hand and all but he was keeping his hand on his nose naturally he was going to get the here so this is the book t means you have to perform that particular type of action in a very proper manner and that is the strength of the human being and this we are slowly slowly learning every day every day the children do not understand the human children slowly slowly they are learning that what actually they are learning how to take action but theme to sorrow theme with thee the decision should be taken properly that's called boody and this would be that is the symbol and is a great symbol and bhakti the devotion that is a symbol as Lotus or a flower but in the Tantra in the tundra also the symbol is y entre I'd be giving it a three days retreat on the tundra that time I will try to speak on that yantra mantra tantra this yantra is a way that they draw if you come and see when you worship we would do something with the water under our seat on which we are sitting what is that to purify that seed then we keep a flower on the head and again we are sitting quietly take out that again take the flower and smell on over that and this way when we are releasing when us that that is called from inside the god is coming and sitting on that flower and putting on the water so this way we do inhaling that means taking in the god inside when exhaling on that it is we are putting outside all symbol and then you find after the puja is over so many much of rice white rice all around that why because we throw in this way and when were throwing that those rise we're doing on ringing the bill that is the own car is going on and the rice is becoming the fire all around us we did in a circle of that fire we are sitting imagining that nothing is going to happen to me because i am going to worship to all symbol and now Sheba he's sitting every Sheba image of the Hindu you will find a snake it is really snake note is symbol but the snake is a symbol of yoga when one is meditating that means the power the primal power coming up from the bottom going to the weight and it is moving like a snake naturally the snake is the symbol of the yoga now if you look at the symbol of the ramakrishna mission those who have noticed is the combination of all the four yugas in the Hinduism we have four wonderful ways divine ways paths that leading towards God gianna karma bhakti and yoga these all the four together will lead you to the god what is that God paramahamsa again the symbol what is that paramahamsa Jesus wom is leaving in the water but water cannot touch its body constantly fresh so similarly living inside this world but never attached with anything of this world that is called paramahamsa how it is possible by practicing these yoga Shami be waken the himself drew that and that is the greatest symbol wonderful symbol all the four yoga's together if you see the first is the snake suppose we misunderstand that we forget that after 1000 years our devotees Ramakrishna mission devotees if the CEO no no we are ramakrishna mission devotee we have to have a snake always in our house because that is our God wrong we never said that swami ji never said that there is a symbol symbols of yoga early morning we are getting up coming sitting meditating that is the symbol of yoga that is the yoga we are practicing then we are doing the worship at about eight-thirty if you come you will find that our Swamiji is doing the charter uttering the mantras and showing these and that he is doing the devotion practicing devotion and then we go and start selling books are talking with people and all this that is the karma and also reading books and scriptures that the gaana all the for yoga together we are practicing almost all they do but they say my stress on this some people they say bhakti only sam SE gana only salmonella karma but ours is the combination of all the four that is the very important the symbol if you notice Ramakrishna mission symbol we are today discussing days this you will find that a Sun is rising rising sun in that symbol that is the symbol of knowledge the darkness removing when the Sun is coming up and that is the symbol of knowledge when the knowledge is coming all this I was observing today we went to today was the final day to purchase a condor we are having over there in the downtown chicago and hyde park near the hyper and if you open the door you can go to that fast their steps and there from there you can see the lake beautiful view but do we were asking the children to go over there they're not they're not very much afraid because thats tips are not very secured so they were very much afraid to go over there why ignorance for us there is no problem we stepped on that we enjoyed the view we came back what the children were not DD I was scared they never wanted to go over there where is the difference knowledge and ignorance when the knowledge comes you become powerful because you know this is nothing so that is the Sun when it is rising that means the knowledge is dawning then all the ignorance going away and we understanding this human body is nothing but a temple of God that is the beauty and second comes after the knowledge and if you find there's a lotus devotion then there's a wavy water the wavy water is the symbol of work why we be because work constantly going on on and on you can stop it some people are thinking that after the work is done then I will come and do some imagication impossible because the work will go on and on and that's the waves that comes under if you go and stand on the seashore you will find the waves after waves is coming so it is never stopped and there is a wonderful slow cuz I'm trianon the G in his later he has mentioned if anyone is thinking that led the waves be quiet and then only I will go and take a bath in that the ocean oh he is a fool never do that you have to go in that so what we have to do we have to perform and in that only from that own you get to come out that is the symbol and the snake is the yoga this for if you practice one day you will realize God within yourself that is the old symbol of the ramakrishna mission here raghavan see ramakrishna is asking see more the master Mahad and before that he is telling him one must accept the forms of God there's a great world because majority of the people they think no no why would kind God as formed and here ceramic is not very categorically asking that three more the master much I threw him to each and every one who were really sincere to realize God he is telling one must accept the forms of God then he is asking do you know the meaning of the image of jagged artery she is the bureau of the universe the Divine Mother jagadhari reveals ourselves in the heart of one who can control the mind which may be compared to an elephant which may be compared to an elephant that they always say the mind is like at elephant and why because neiva cares for anything it goes in his own way so unless and until you can control the mind you can never ever think of realizing God that is the first thing and only thing in the bhagavad-gita also we find the Krishna is giving the advice to the arjuna you must have to do that and the original argument it is impossible is it is not impossible but difficult how it is possible then he gives again suggesting that you have to practice practice practice Oh brca2 cone the boy lagina gigliotti abhyasa again and again you have to practice and he is again giving the description that the lion that is yours ill that is your decision that is your strong will power every day early morning you must get up immediately go and pour the water on your a all the slip they will go then you come and sit before the god try to meditate if you practice in that way you will find that exactly that early morning you are getting up and then you are feeling to go and meditate that feeling will come it will drag you Oh biasa practice practice practice and when you are practicing that then only you can control your mind and another this Govinda win is asking why does the Divine Mother have a black complexion then he says master is telling you see you see hard black because you are far away from her you see her black because you are far away from harm go near and he will find heart devoid of all color there's a beautiful song in Bengali shaam amake amar calorie and in that is asking that there the poet is asking is my mother Kali is black but I see her in different color and I see her in different form kaukauna purusa cocoon of Prakriti when sometimes sees in the male form sometime she is in the female form sometimes yellow white sometimes black and sometimes colorless this is realisation from the realization is not imagination perfect realization and see Ramakrishna after realizing this goddess Kali he is mentioning days the water of the lake appears black from a distance go near and take the water in your hand and he will see that it has no color at all how wonderful example that is shamma is all Subramani shamma is using this word shamma that means the black one is also Brahman that reaches form again is without for that which has fought again is without form that which has attributes attributes means guna that means he is all-pervading his all-powerful raised these is that all these gunas the attributes again has no attributes at all sattva Raja Tama that is the main attributes that we put Brahman is Shakti Shakti is Brahman this is the reason great mass this our see Rama Krishna and his words are nothing but knowledge knowledge and knowledge and this is solving the problem for hundreds of years we were thinking of these fighting on that the pundits up depend is all the scriptural that people they were going on arguing the great debates were going on for hundreds of years whether the God has form or not here he is solving he is and again he is not then what is the meaning of the yogamaya the he is asking that Govinda devotee it signifies the yoga or union apalooza and the kirthi the purusha means the male aspect of the reality and the soul and a pop-up that absolute and the prakruti the female aspect of the reality there's a both are there is not Mel it is not femal is only the consciousness but we depict that particular consciousness the Brahman sometimes as a male sometimes as a female why we can understand it better we always can understand these differences rather and the mother so it's called shiva and kali the symbol that has come in the tundra Sheba and Kali of this the knowledge and the power bhagawan sri ramakrishna is giving this description and he says whenever you perceive in the universe is the outcome of the youth whatever you perceive is the outcome of the Union take the image of shiva and kali kali stands on the bosom of the Shiva Shiva lies under our feet like a corpse Carly looks at shiva all this denote the union of the purusha and the prakruti Buescher is the inactive therefore Shiva lies on the ground and the prakruti performs all our activities in the conjunction with the purusha and the same way is the radha and krishna is mentioning over here is the same way the rather and krishna on account of the Union again the images are slightly inclined towards each other radha krishna when the Sheba is lying like a dead person the kali is standing on the chest of the Sheba she is looking at the eye of the Shiva many of the main images the Kali is actually looking at the Shiva and there it means is getting the inspiration the knowledge ideas and then performing the activity is the same person the shiba the same person when active is kali krishna is Radha and rather again is the krishna no difference the last time in our retreat we were singing a virgin and in that the last line is the Radha and Krishna unitedly created a wonderful play Radha Krishna a cotton yoooo yo ekata new da no means the body when they become one both become one akata yo yo rangamma chai ranga means all these things are creating because of this the activity and the knowledge coming together then only the creation otherwise only knowledge is there no activity how the creation will come goddess Kali if you notice hands that they're hanging from her West now human hands are hanging from her waist and all the heads of the humans call human aids that is as a girl and the human caves as a symbol of knowledge and the hands the symbol of work and she is the prakruti she is the nature and that is why from that knowledge is action if you don't have the knowledge you cannot do anything sometimes there is a card there's the key but you don't have the knowledge to drive you need to go somewhere things that they are ready but you cannot why because you do not you are not having the knowledge of driving the things are really but we cannot go we cannot move we have to wait for somebody else who is having the knowledge so only the things aren't hell you should have two things knowledge first in action so action and the knowledge it goes together mccauley goddess Kali she is a symbol of that she is glad because we do not know the moment we will known we will see that it is that is the same thing happened in the life of xiaomi Vivekananda you know that great story the devotee realizes that it is Brahman alone that has become all these the living beings the universe and so on Ramakrishna is telling devotees and the devotee means God and they worshiper that means that waiter even the do 18 do was those who are thinking I am separate and the God is separate ultimately what you will see that is what the Ramakrishna says the devotees realize that it is Brahman alone devotees again realizing brahmana Brahman the word that used by the path of the Ghani gannys only used that those who are following the path of knowledge they follow though they use this word Brahman those who are following the path of bhakti the devotion they say Ishwara vagabond God here see Ramakrishna says devotee realizes that it is Brahman alone that has become all these the living beings the universe and so on and again to that Govinda is telling some ceramic is nestling sometimes I say thou are verily I and I am verily thou again I feel dau art thou you are you you are me and I am you three different way that means all is this in the Hanuman the great devotee he mentioned that when they feel that I'm separate from you dejo budva da sua I am your servant when I am different from you jeeva budva totems occur when not the this face body but the soul when I feel that I mean soul then I feel and the part of you jeeva boudoir tadam Chaka Atma budva tommy bahama when I am I have that atma budva Buddha means that knowledge and what is that akma that is Brahman and I feel both of our same there is no difference at movado Tommy baume ET many cheetah amethi this is my form decisions so the difference is nowhere the devotion the knowledge both are leading to the same goal and ceramic ishness mentioning that it is Shakti alone that become flesh as God incarnate the ship t alone the Shakti means the power of God Maya yogamaya he was asking that question what is the yogamaya what is that Maya that Maya is the power of God that is controlling our mind all beings mind control with the Maya yoga uke tamiya and the yogamaya means sometimes the incarnation they come to this world they take the human form the live with us just like us but they are controlling the Maya through yoga utha constantly they're connected with the Darkman but at the same time they're behaving like us there's call yogamaya those who have already read the life of Master domine de vie you know that this word was used for one lady small baby the baby was quoting at the back of her mother who lost her senses just like a mad oh man she was going and the little baby and she was crawling and following then the Taku appeared see Ramakrishna appeared before the mother mother was thinking why to live in this world she was thinking to give up the body but Saddam Krishna wanted hard to stay back for the betterment of the human being so he appeared and sowed disease they you must go and see and mothers compassion the love attracted to the small little baby crawling and that pathetic seen she could not restrain she weighing and picked up up immediately Ramakrishna appeared and told DCI yogamaya this you have to keep your mind down to this earthly plane with the help of this lady this girl the radi radu that Raju then if you have read the life of mother she is full with that constantly keeping them on mother busy with so many things so when you read sometimes we lose our further so what is this that girl is doing to mother what so many but the mother is patiently going on serving heart that is called yogamaya by the way the time came mother decided to give up the body even though if the small little baby was there panera and that they thought that we must bring down the mother the mind of the mother because she used to love that small baby very much so they brought that baby before the mother then she pushed away that baby aside and told taking away and tell syrup syrup means the southern ambaji who was to look after the mother that I have we drawn my mouth mind I gave that mine now have withdrawn the mind that is yogamaya they're controlling the mind controlling the Maya but we are under the CIM compulsion of the Maya Maya is controlling us we are constantly thinking these that we cannot go beyond that that is the problem only if we can do that the Maya and the yogamaya that is the different differences and here Ramakrishna said and this is very very important he is telling to the master 3 more let me ask you not to disbelieve in the form of God do you remember when you started reading this gospel and then see Ramakrishna was asking the master Mahad Seymour who came what is your faith do you believe God informer without it that was the norm of in those days all educated people this to think how the all-pervading God all-powerful God can enter into an image so naturally he said I
