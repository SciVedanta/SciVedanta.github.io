[296. Panchama Veda 296 - “We see God Himself if we but see His Incarnation”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irx7BVkLSis)

namaskar dear devotees and friends today wednesday evening we'll be reading the gospel of bhagavatam krishna the panchama veda and let us begin as usual from the gopi gita tavakatham khabib a friends the those who are following this class you know that we have discussed in our previous class that is on the 20th while reading a statement of bhagavan sirama krishna pure souls are the veritable manifestation of god and our today's topic we see god himself if we but see his incarnation i give this you know you cannot say that is a topic and then discussing only on this we are reading the gospel and giving special attention to this type of statements that the bhagavan has given sir ramakrishnadev has given now here the last week we have discussed about those who are pure souls and you know that the absolute devotion and love to live in a quiet place and shunning the company of the worldly people these in the according to the bhagavad-gita are the symbol of a pure soul so this type of people they always love to listen love to talk love to read about god and they cannot in that way they cannot live in the company of the worldly people those who will be talking about the different type of worldly things worldly matters they feel pain in that that is the one of the symbols in the bhagavad-gita that is the 13th chapter 10th verse we have explained in the previous class uh it is in the youtube those who have not attended you can go back and see that and listen to that so this is the one bhagavad who is a pure soul then in the we find the bashist muni he is mentioning that he is a satyana he is a pure soul whose greed delusion and anger is reducing so every day slowly slowly it is going away in one moment it cannot those are very pure soul like swami brahman and the swami vivekananda they were like that bhagavan si ramakrishna is mentioning about them now we know that he is mentioning about them he is asking the devotee to feed them so that they will get lot of blessings because these pure souls they don't have any attachment with the worldly things and anything any mind any thought which is not thinking about the worldly things the things with the attached with the ego selfishness then it is a pure mind so again and again we have to understand these purity doesn't mean something external purity means detachment with the worldly objects and attachment to the divine things that much attaching to the god and detaching or giving away the worldly things which is associated with ego that much that is purity and yatha shastra biharati we explained that now in shankaracharya also we discuss ke santi santo who is a pure soul the sankaracharya is asking then he himself is giving the answer raga one who is completely free from desire that there are different type of desires are there so akilabi taraga in the same way he is completely free from delusion so what is the delusion delusion means attraction to the worldly of objects by raw mistake the what we think this is wonderful this is going to give me joy and i am going to gain by achieving that dissolved delusion because worldly things means temporary for a few days then again you have to go back to the misery state that is called delusion again and again we are making the mistake that's called delusion so this is what he said kosanti santa he is completely free from delusion this he has given up but he has taken his mind to what shiva tattoo see giving the worldly things and accepting the spirituality shiva shiva means purity shiva means auspiciousness shiva tattanishta what is that the truth what is that truth god alone exists so when some people they are having these qualities they are called pure souls the bhagavan si rama krishna was praising them but today he is mentioning that we see god himself if we but see his incarnation then it was that we were reading the chapter 38 is a page 725 of the english book the master mahashaya writing after school hours aim returned to balarama's house and found the master sitting in the drawing room surrounded by his devotees and disciple among them were girish suresh balarama latu and chunilal the master to girish you had better argue this point with narendra and see what he has to say and they were some discussions were going on master told girish then the girish narendra says that god is infinite we cannot even much as to say that the things or persons we perceive are parts of god how can infinity have parts it cannot the narendra that time a very young boy of 1718 maybe so he was but see look at that at that time he has read and he has developed and he is now arguing in that that way so this is the thing we have to understand the master however great and infinite god may be his essence can and does manifest itself through man by his mere will so narendra says that god is infinite we cannot even so much as say that the things or person we perceive are parts of god how can infinity have parts this is the argument of narendra now bhagavan suramar krishna is mentioning however great and infinite god may be his essence can and does manifest itself through man by his mere will the ceramic krishnas clear there is no confusion about that is why the gospel of krishna is so important because all the time whenever we are reading it we are getting a clear idea about the god about the path of that we had to follow he said no narendra at that time when he was young he heard he read and according to his idea whatever he realized at that time he said god cannot have any part and he was influenced mostly by a divine a group of people that is brahma samajis but sudama krishna is rectifying with no it is possible god may be infinite god may be the great but at the same time god is coming down and manifesting through the human being and this is the basis of hinduism god's incarnation as man cannot be explained by analogy one must feel it for oneself and realize it by direct perception so unless and until one is feeling about it realizing it it is not possible so what is god that is important god has all power god is everywhere god is the knower of everything these are this is the way we try to understand god but at the same time very directly we can feel the one who is full of love and afterwards this narendra who became vivekananda through his their own realization understanding then he said about bhagavan sirama krishna who was the god himself incarnated as human being about him he said l-o-b-e personified so what is surama krishna love personified then what is god it is love so this is this we will understand afterwards slowly the things are going and today the discussion is slowly taking us to the incarnation god's incarnation one must feel it for oneself and realize it by direct perception and analogy can give us only a little glimpse by touching the horns legs or tail of a cow we in fact touch the cow herself but for us the essential thing about a cow is our milk which comes through the order the divine incarnation is like the order god incarnates himself as man from time to time in order to teach people devotion and divine love now sudama krishna is very clear why the god is incarnating to teach us the divine love what is god love and why the god is taking the form accepting the form to teach us that divine love now here the divine love the girish narendra says is it ever possible to know all of god he is infinite so we can understand the argument that the young narendra was giving so it has a great influence of the brahma-samajis the brahma-samajis they developed that theory because they were trying to counter the the christianity which was constantly attacking the hinduism because of the idol worships they were worshiping the different images different statues so the christians is to say criticizing the how god which is infinite can be into that small little image or a doll they mainly they used to say the doll how it is possible god is total how can it be part that is the argument that those christians used to give that time and narendra was at the counter the brahma-samajis they were not with the traditional hindus they were not with the christians in between they developed that path and they wanted to say the god is all pervading god has no form etc we know that about the brahma-samaj idea narendra was influenced by that so he was going on arguing the girish narendra says is it ever possible to know all of god he is infinite mastered to girish who can comprehend everything about god all of god not in the said the suramar krishna is using the word comprehend all of god it is impossible because he is the creator whatever he wants us to understand we only understand that much in in other places bhagavan srama krishna mentioned even the sukhodeva he could take a little water out of that infinite ocean of divinity of god a little water he could take as if little knowledge of that and that was sufficient it is impossible in reality but at least we can understand that much it is not given to man to know any aspect of god great or small and what need is there to know everything about god it is enough if we only realize him and we see god this line is very important i quote it from here we see god himself if we but see his incarnation suppose a person goes to the ganges and touches its water he will then say yes i have seen and touched the ganges to say this it is not necessary for him to touch the whole length of the river from hardware or to ganga sagar everybody laughed suryama krishna too hardware from where the ganga is managing and ending to the ganga saga friends in this connection i just like to remind you that we have uploaded one video so that is there we are trying to see the hinduism how it uh developed in devil different uh the holy places pilgrim places right from gangotri and down to the ganga sagar and visiting the this this is really very good and in different places our swamis they are also giving some examples how it was connected with the life of swami vivekanda that this was shown in the parliament of religion it's a very interesting uh i think you people will like it it is there in the youtube itself the srama krishna is mentioning from hardware to ganga sagar or duary say so haridwar from to ganga saga we need not to go and touch the whole ganga anywhere you just go down and touch the ganga you can say similarly if we have seen the incarnation we have seen god this is the point so here we have to understand what is this incarnation in the bhagavad-gita chapter 4 gyana yoga in the verse 6 we find does god manifest as human on this world answer is yes how then this the it says that the fourth chapter sixth verse of the bhagavad-gita though i am unborn and eternal by nature god himself lord sri krishna he is mentioning though i am unborn and eternal by nature ajupi sannaba atma is giving the stress i am unborn again even then sun abbaya atma i'm eternal by nature abbaya so eternal by nature and though i am the lord of all beings bhutan yet subjugating my prakrti i accept birth through my own maya this line is important our birth we are bound to take birth why because of our desire because of our karma and this result we have to come down to experience the result of our karma good or bad whatever we are bound but the god is not even then he is coming down as if manifesting as if with the power of his maya the maya is god's power and how it works the vidantin student you know there are three qualities gunas and two power the one is covering and second is imposing something else on that so we don't see the truth because it is covered by the maya in such a way it is impossible to see rather we are bewildered by seeing something else on that and whatever we like to see we see on that so these are the power of maya the god's power so ajupi atma bhutan is just through the power of maya as if i am manifested but it is not in reality as it manifested sometimes the science fiction stories they they'll be when we read maybe as the science is progressing and as because of the kovid we are all maintaining the distances is going on continuing maybe that will be feasible that will be practical one day that throwing the image far away places then a person going over there and standing talking as if he's just standing there but it is this three-dimensional image it may be someday sometimes it is they are doing maybe it is very costly so this is the way as if the god is manifesting and we can see him we can talk to him we can touch him we can live with him and we call him the incarnation of god why because the unique characteristics is not like us a completely different but that's why he's so important when the sri krishna came some of the pure soul like the bhishma they realized him understood him they understood that is the god in that form so they were respecting him so much other people couldn't they were with him rather they were planning to kill him and to insult him and so many things in the mahabharata those who have read you you know that the god was living with them they could not understand why because their mind was not pure but some of the people they understood like the kunti understood bhisma understood bidura understood the different characters very pure what is the purity again there is no attachment to the worldly objects so the mind was completed towards god and in that mind the revelation of the true nature of god was there they could understand him similarly with bhagavan sirama krishna too many people lived with him so closely for such a long time they used to play with him they were our friends but even then the relatives they couldn't understand but maha sharadamani devi swami vivekananda made the other direct disciples baloram bush in whose house we are now meeting bhagavan sirama the many of the householders devotees they understood why again the mind was purified and whose mind was purified a personality like girish chandra ghosh any moment any person can be purified why the moment you you withdraw the mind from the worldly objects which is associated with the ego when you are completely free from the ego immediately that purity comes and when that purity comes we can understand and when we see that incarnation we see god himself that is why bhagavan sirama krishna is very clearly mentioning we see god himself if we but see his incarnation himself is mentioning and all these people sitting around how many they understood it this is maya the god is sitting with us but we can't understand why then in our mind there will be some idea oh this is how can he be god because he is having only two hands he's not having different heads as we see in the brahma four heads or the shiva and like that different way they always think krishna had to prove by showing so many miracles supernatural power by lifting in one finger the whole hill even then people were doubting him jesus had to walk on the water only to bring some faith on him people don't understand what is god they only understand and accept miraculous power but nowadays modern science is doing so much of miracle how just by harassing the nature utilizing the nature analyzing the nature it is possible i am sitting over here in chicago and just looking at the camera and talking to you and you all over the world listening to me is it not miracle a few years before people would have given the name oh this is miracle the he is sitting in one place and talking with so many people you can see him you can listen to him but the science is doing it what greatness is there so that greatness is not in these the when we understand that incarnation it is his quality when we see the incarnation we see the god and what is that incarnation that particular form you know that it says why the god is accepting the this form in the seventh verse of the same chapter chapter four it says now why because of this when that i have to whenever there is decline of dharma righteousness what is righteousness believing that there is a soul there is god and believing that one is controlling his nature but nature is constantly provoking to react fight with that man go and kill him cheat him enjoy then all the time nature will be provoking and i can control we can control that the tremendous force of the nature which is dragging us down by thinking about god by mora thinking about the morality how much it can be controlled by the law of the land the people the government is making the laws out of fear some people are controlled but whenever there is an opportunity they are breaking it so the best development when you understand this people understand this that when i am going and hurting someone physically or through word or many any other way actually i'm hurting myself because it is coming back to me and it more falls so then i will restrain myself no i won't do it so that is called dharma dharma means understanding the reality i am not this body but i am the soul and soul is traveling because of my karma and i am performing karma the action the work through three different ways physically mentally and through words so we must be very very careful when you are talking with someone we must be always positive when we are thinking we must be praying when we are acting we must be completely restrained and by that way so these are the ways one can become purified but unless and until that is there the faith is there the belief is there there is no difference between human and other beings maybe like we can say the animals so by that way we are winning ourselves so this is called religion religion is a process that makes a brute unto man man unto god the process means understanding and then following that there may be argument birth due to karma good or bad does god also has karma the counter we have already discussed god is all-powerful sarba shaktimaan in sanskrit it says sarva means all shakthi means power man the one who is having shakthi man one who is having the power server all power so any type of work he can do and in the lagoon bhagavatam is a mentioning like this if you are not having that power then how can you call yourself as god then the person who is not having any property any land any money how can he claim that i am a rich man i am a landlord you don't have land how can you say you are the landlord you are not having any wealth how can you say that you are rich so it's the same way if the god is not having this power what is that power anything he can be informed he can be without form he can be here this moment he can be anywhere that very moment he can be in any form in any way manifesting he can't do anything to deen only parama ishwaratta so the bhagavatam is telling so this is the way sometimes some people they always they consider god as the creator and ruler of this universe when they consider the ruler of this universe creator of this universe they considered that god is living like a ruler separately in a palace it doesn't come down to the ordinary people mixing with the ordinary people somewhere outside this creation somewhere in the heaven we don't know where is heaven so they always imagine that god is sitting in the heaven and he is ruling the whole world this universe he giving the punishment or reward according to the work they do not consider they cannot think that god can come down and live like us they say no there is cannot be the incarnation they always think that god is that's why in christianity also we find they said that god has sent his son not himself his son to teach the spirituality religion and then he is communicating with the son through the holy spirit to the trinity that is the conception but the vedanta says no god is everything god is one without second so except that we are now using the word god usually the vedanta will say that it is brahman brahman means all pervading consciousness and eternally going on increasing infinite we cannot limit oh this is this much no it cannot be there is no limit unlimited so that is why that is called brahman the sanskrit word they use brahman so this brahman is only one and without any second it has no two then many of you then you know that they will be giving the nicely they'll be explaining sagata veda sarupa veda and like that they'll say no no no sagata no no it is not like this it is not like this so i am not talking that today here so by that way they are proving god is only one there cannot be two if that is so then how can be the separate things where from we came where from these animals came these birds came these trees came the plants came anything that you see is nothing but the same god friends this unique conception that god is in everything you will find in the image of god is durga the always hindus they are worshipping in the images but they're all symbolic the goddess durga particularly eastern side if you go is having tain hands the ten hands means darshad every direction everywhere that is the main thing everywhere god is there and god is in the reptile you will find that snake god is in the in the animals you will find the lion and the rat god is in the that the whole gamut of the animal god is in the birds there's a peacock and an owl the whole gamut of the birds and god is in the trees and the plant plants that there'll be a planting tree and that there they will put different varieties of plants together god is there too and god is in good god is in bad so that is the way the whole the durga image and god is all powerful in the hindu gods and goddesses are all having the different the weapons in their hands in and but they are very docile the hindu religion itself very decided it's not going to fight with anyone but our all gods and goddesses are having are very powerful the weapons why because only to say the god is powerful all-powerful so this is the whole image that mad durga image is that is the indication god is powerful ekam eva advitium is only one and it is not two in that case where from two will come it is all god only so this is the main way they say the incarnation now we the ordinary people the being we are thinking good and bad we are acting good and bad we are saying good and bad so that work the karma follow the result of that work that takes us constantly bringing us over here in different forms different names different times and we go on circulating in that circle of birth and death there are six varieties of changes so it goes on but the god is free from that he comes just out of his own and then he leaves and he guides us now there are different the the opinion about the incarnation in muhammad we find that means incarnation and they are beginning with the first of authorized hamsa that you will find that is the hamsa means the brahm the first brahmana he came manifested as a swan so they are counting from that up to 10 no buddha buddha has not come over there in the mahabharata list then come bhagavatam in the bhagavata we find 22 different varieties of god's incarnation and then comes the purana in the purana we find the again 10 bhagavata says 22 but the purana says 10 and there they include buddha and then exclude that hamsa then that is the way the different way they think but when bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning that we see god himself if we but see his incarnation that this is important because here a little clarification is necessary sometimes out of our emotion we think oh these particular incarnation whom i am worshipping is the only god that is the problem that's why in the all our scripture they are giving so many incarnation at different time in different situations different type of incarnation may come in the bhagavata itself sometimes some people who are following the bhagavata and they become so narrow-minded they say only this is the god and no one is there again the problem and it comes because of our ego in the bhagavata it says ashankar because there is no limit god can come in different form just wishes the moment he wishes and it it comes who is going to restrict him hey you cannot go there you have to follow this rule can god be ruled by that so that is why ashankar there is so many millions and millions sometimes in different places it comes so hindus they accept whenever they see the manifestation of the divinity friends those who are have read the bhagavad-gita if you read the 16th chapter the first three verses of the chapter 16 chapter of the gita 26 different qualities have been mentioned divine qualities and then rest again the lord himself krishna is mentioning about the ashura again the that is all bad qualities divine qualities and the devilish qualities and these 26 good qualities if one can achieve a queer he become god himself she become god herself so that is the main thing when the lord jesus said he who has seen the son has seen the god what he meant when we look at the jesus there is no there was no camera at that time 2000 years before but some people there drawn the picture we can understand as a jewish the structure of the body long hair long beard beautiful eyes very unique very attractive looking beautiful looking lord jesus is that god others those who are all around are not the god if you have seen the son has seen the god means god is having the beard god is having the long hair god is having that type of feature is that good jesus meant i don't think so it cannot be when the bhagavan sinama krishna is mentioning about those who have seen the incarnation have seen the god himself what what incarnation there are so many incarnation as i mentioned over here according to bhagavat 22 incarnations are there the all these incarnations then which one is god it is not the frame it is not the feature it is not that particular body in which the god manifested it is the quality of that particular person even sometimes you will find in the avatar they are mentioning in the purana there are animals are also there there are fish is there but even then we consider them why the action of that particular being if you notice is always for the betterment of others as a fish is saving the whole world as a bow he's saving the whole universe and each and every time in different form is manifesting only to save the humanity that is the quality if we look at that incarnation means that love that unselfishness that completes dedication for the betterment of others that is called god why because the god is not having any selfish motive whether you love me or not whether you worship me or not whether you have faith in me or not according to your work your result you will go on but god is always standing opening his hands to embrace each and every one so when the lord bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning we see god himself if we but see his incarnation is it is not that particular body that he is having at that time that moment at that period it is the quality that he has manifested god as sri ramachandra god as shri krishna god as sri ramakrishna the qualities so that is very very important now here suppose a person goes to the ganges he mentioned if you go and see the incarnation you understand what is god love and unselfishness if i touch your feet surely that is the same as touching you so if we can understand that the if i touch your feet surely that is the same as touching you if a person goes to the ocean and touches but a little of its water he has surely touched the ocean itself fire as an element exists in all things but in wood it is present to a greater decree so incarnation means the fullest degree of that manifestation each and every being is having love so that it says that even in the animals we find that affection that love that some many stories are there so how the animals are saving even the human child so by that way we can understand that affection that love that is also present over there but manifest in his manifestation is little that is possible in the human mind it can manifest in the fullest it go human can't become god giddy's smiling i am looking for fire naturally i want to go to a place where i can get it it's just joking the girish used to smoke so he wanted some fire to light his at this cigarette or something so he's just joking with that sudama krishna smiling yes fire as an element is present more in wood than in any other object friends the sirama krishna's uniqueness see when a very ordinary war he is telling the highest philosophy but in a very simple way even the all around people who are taking it very in a very simple way and just joking even with on that he's not minding but as a great teacher he is bringing back the same idea and again trying to give it to them so that they can understand it goes down to their heart so they by that he is telling yes the fire as an element is present more in wood than in any other object if you see god then seek him in man if you seek god i repeat then seek him in man he manifest himself more in man than in any other thing that sometimes we neglect human being and worship a piece of wood or a picture or a stone or something some books and we spend millions and millions of dollars to make that structure while the human being are suffering so that we have to keep in mind so brahma krishna vivekananda they are teaching us again and again he who is serving the human being is serving the god why god is more potent more manifested in human being if you see a man endowed with ecstatic love overflowing with prema mad after god intoxicated with his love they know for certain that god has incarnated himself through that man the love when a man is withdrawing his mind from the worldly objects like the name fame and physical comfort and all others from there if he then of course he is actually manifesting that law and how you'll understand that many people they will be living very austere life but very selfish very egoistic cannot cope up with others cannot live with others cannot cooperate with others cannot think good about others no no so that only the that's why it's always say the manifestation of god how it is it will prove not the austerity is outwardly he is showing or she is showing but the unselfishness but the love that is the concern that is the main thing to aim to master marsha the surama krishna is telling there is no doubt that god exists in all things but the manifestation of his power are different in different beings the great manifestation of his power is through an incarnation again in some incarnations there is a complete manifestation of god's power it is the shakti the power of god that is born as an incarnation so sometimes even in the incarnation also we find that is those who are associated they do know the the quranic the stories of the incarnations there are different type of incarnation doing different type of work and as i said always they're trying to re-establish the dharma the righteousness but their actions may be different the powers are also different there is a beautiful story that just because before sri ramachandra there was parasurama another rama but he was parasurama the parasurama and sri ramachandra they once mate the parasurama he was teaching the the kings though those who were breaking the rules and trying to use their muscle power manpower to grab the power to enjoy the worldly things parasurama tried to teach them the lesson sometimes punishing them fighting with them to to tell them that you have to keep a balance of course we need the worldly things but it should have a balance otherwise the human being will become very greedy and there is no end of this desire after satisfying one desire there will be another desire after satisfying that that there will be another desire it continues it goes on that's why one should be very careful and how it is possible there should be someone constantly controlling the mind the guru the spiritual teacher that should be there the dwayne these some of the shatrias some of the kings they were breaking that parasharam took up that cause and were fighting with them to re-establish when the ramachandra came sri immediately surrendered and his work was complete he left rama sri ramachandra was establishing the wonderful system in the family in the society so that without saying anything just by behaving he was giving the law how the human society should then the sri krishna came so one after another it was constantly going on helping the humanity to move towards the perfection to god so it is incarnation the power is manifested but in every being it is there if the buddha could realize the truth any one of us can also realize the truth this is the great statement swami vivekananda said to buddhahood each and every one of us has a right we can achieve the buddhahood the way buddha got that he was a gothama then he controlled his senses then he withdrew the senses concentrated on the truth and one day he realized the truth of oneness and he became buddha bodhi means the gyana the knowledge knowledge of oneness anyone can do that no no no only buddha can have no one else you are all sinners you have to nothing like that this is the uniqueness of vedanta if they say each soul is potentially divine then any being anything that divinity is there more manifested in human being and more manifested those who are trying to manifest it that is called pure souls and fully manifested in the incarnations because they are the part and parcel of god that is exactly what the srama krishna is mentioning again in some incarnation there is a complete manifestation of god's power friends i think we should stop over here and then in the next class we will begin from here so the first question is from devashi she is asking we often come across people who are often jealous or criticize people and don't allow people to live happily in life is it due to the reason of bad karma we cannot avoid how to overcome such situations that is that is to some extent it is true devastation correct that you know sometimes because of our bad karma we come to enclose an association with this type of negative people but we should pray for them you know why that they got the opportunity but they are misutilizing it not understanding the uniqueness of this human life and by that way they are going downwards they may not know it but they are going sometime somewhere they will take birth and they will suffer forget about that we have to go on praying to god god please give him the positive thinking and by that way also just by praying for this person who is very negative criticizing others you can become pure just by praying for him try to do that that will be a good idea and by that way you will be saved from that company where you are not liking surely god will take you somewhere else where you will be completely free from that bad influences thank you sanhedev energy is asking the next question how can we motivate our lazy mind which sometimes appears in our mind our laziness will be there that is the nature of the mind and whenever we try to do something good and the more that type of thing comes you know as if the nature try to suppress us that is obviously the more you're trying to be good you'll find all your friends are criticizing and the relatives are joking making fun of you because you are trying to tell the truth because they're trying to help others because they're trying to be good is very peculiar but more they do more you should say to yourself oh i'm on the right track and i must follow and after a few days all they will go away and they will come and they will say please bless us this is the proof of divinity the once you try to do good in the beginning there will be oppositions then they will be simply avoid you oh let him go there's a there's a crazy fellow let me do then finally in the third step it will be acceptance they will come and accept you as someone who is holy so this we have seen in our lives we see every time and that is the proof of the power of holiness so don't bother about that you have to tell your mind okay you like to take rest now today tomorrow i will do it and make a routine and try to follow strictly by that routine thank you thank you friends let us chant this mantra and conclude [Music] is [Music] [Music] foreign
