[276. Panchama Veda 276 : One Is able to see God through Telescope of Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU-x0nCIL9I)

namaskar today wednesday evening their devotees and friends will be reading from the gospel of siram krishna the panchama veda now before that please chant along with me [Music] venom [Music] in our last discussion we mentioned that master mashay aim was reading from the bankim chandras the famous book devi chaudhurani it was page 686 in the gospel of bhagavan sriram krishna from here you will find sirama krishna was listening and sometimes expressing his own opinions about the decisions of the writer and the page 683 bhavani patak and praful all these he started reading about them uh mostly the bengali people they would be knowing and those who are in english also that book is available that uh devi jodhurani so main theme the bangkim chandra he was writing that a group of people they have formed a group they are patriarchs they are against the british rule they want to do something for the poor people so they were in the opinion they'd be looting and the rovering from the rich people and bringing the money and distribute among the poor people that was the idea so that is the way the whole thing that they got a lady and that leader the he the bhavani patak that he was training giving the training to that lady to become the leader of the group and they will be going out mixing with people talking to impressing them and then getting the information so that the male members they can go so that is the whole idea and like a robin hood idea so they will be going and fighting and then getting the money and then distributing among the poor people so this he was reading because of the famous books ramakrishna wanted to know about it so aim read from the book again it is 686 page prafullah like my actions i offer all my wealth to sri krishna there was a dialogue between the prafulla and the bhavani patak the bhavani is asking all prabhullah yes all bhavani in that case you won't be able to perform action in a detached spirit see the bankim chandra he was very thorough about hinduism so the karma yoga he wanted to introduce through this story and the pavani pattak mentioning about that if you have to work to earn your food you will be attached to that work hence there are two alternatives before you either you will have to get your food by begging or you will have to leave on your own money even a beggar becomes attached to the arms and he receives therefore you must have you must use your own money to maintain your body now there's a two opinion that the babani patek he was expressing that if you have your own money then you can maintain your own body and with the excess money you better distribute but if you are distributing everything then going for the begging alms even then you have to depend on somebody that is the idea srama krishna is commenting on that was reading he commented that is the nature of a calculating mind and sudama krishna yes that is the nature of the calculating mind that is the way the worldly man thinks but he who seeks god plunge headlong he doesn't calculate about any much or how little he needs for the protection of his body as a surama krishna speaking from the point of view of a completely spiritual person surging or going out to realize god but that is there what he says when a person is going out he never calculates lord buddha never calculated how i am going to get food who will be cooking for me where i will stay never calculated even we when we kill left our heart and home we never knew so where we are going and who will be taking care of us nothing like that only thought that i am going to realize god in this very life itself so that way it he goes so shankaracharya that's why sometimes commented that a male body is that way useful because they can go to any place anywhere but a lady may not be so that is shankara's here suramar krishna is mentioning bhavani pattayaki is not a sannyasi bhavani patak is trying to do some good work in the society but the method is not good but anyway we will go through the book next bhavani asked prabhullah how will you offer all this money to sri krishna prafulla said why shri krishna dwells in all beings i shall distribute the money among them bhavani answered good good quoting from the gita bhavani say never become separated from me nor do i become separated from him that yogi who established in that unity worships me dwelling in all beings abides in me whether he his mode of life whatever is mode of life o arjuna that yogi is regarded as the highest who judges the pleasure and pain of all beings by the same standard so that is from the bhagavad gita like that so here the bhavani that means the right at the writing banking chandra chat is writing from krishna these are the characteristics of the highest bhaktas you know in hinduism there are three different ways and going towards the god now we can say four one is the the bhakta another is gyana another tantra these are the three karma is always associated everyone is doing performing the karma so gyana bhakti karma etc yoga and also the three main path that the hindus they follow one is tantra another vedanta and another is bhakta salaam mentioning the god is separate i am separate i am trying to reach god by seeing god in every being ultimately is the highest bhaktha the characteristics of the highest bhakta i see god ganny will say i say atman brahman in all being the brahman the consciousness is on being the bhakta he will say i see my god in all beings ramakrishna commented again read from the book a man must work hard if he wants to help all being with charity hence it is necessary for him to make a little display of clothes a pomp and luxury therefore bhavani said a little shopkeeping is necessary again the surama krishna sharply a little shopkeeping one speaks as one things if a man thinks of whole worldly things dear now people hypocritically then his words are colored by his thoughts if he should rather if he sorry if one eats radish one belches radish instead of talking about shopkeeping he would rather have said a man should act as if he were the doers knowing very well that he is really not the doer now this is he's reading a book because that was very popular and people was appreciating that book not because of the content that they are going to get money for the poor but the idea that a group of decoys are actually not decoys but karma yogis and they are doing that that is the way they are going to get the liberation going to get the god realization like that so suramar krishna was interested to know about that book he asked his disciple master masha to read out and he's listening but some of the points he is not liking and that is the true guru the guru means always alert and guiding not that he is going to rectify or correct that the writer bankim chandra so when he met him he talked about him too but here through these comments he is trying to reach out to all people who were very much influenced by that book devi chowdhurani and srama krishna is telling it is nothing wrong if you are in the world and trying to do this thing but if you are trying to realize god if you are thinking that you are a spiritual person you should never be hypocrite or why the hypocrisy the many of the people just for the popularity they'll be advertising if they're advertising means they are not true spiritual spirituality doesn't need that you reach out to people you go to and talk as much maximum as possible that's all and if you think that you were going to change the whole world and for that and you'll be taking the help of the advertising companies and they will do all this thing for you that means there is something wrong if believing in the existence of god god is everywhere god knows what is good so sudama krishna is a true guru the god himself in the human form trying to guide us even here also he is mentioning shopkeeping that is hypocrisy showing something and thinking something else no that should not be swami vivekananda also the disciple of sirama krishna swami vivekananda said i can stand everything but hypocrisy what i am not that i am showing to the people and by that way trying to get the appreciation and becoming popular if this world is temporary if this world is an illusion if this world is nothing the god is everything then what should i have to go for the appreciation of the worldly people whoever he may be that is the idea the other day a man was singing here the song contained words like profit and loss i stopped him if one contemplate a particular subject day and night one cannot talk of anything else the reading continued the author was describing the realization of god prophet had become debi chaudhurani it was the month of bayshark devi was seated on the roof of her houseboat talking with deeba and another omen companion the moon was up the boat had cast anchor in the ganges in those days uh many people used to leave in the at the boat houseboat on the on the ganges ravindana's father also live they're rich people they used to live like that and for the safety too durrani that prabhullah the he she needed the safety though there are many people who are there all around heart but in the ganges means if anybody is coming to trying to attack she is safe she will be knowing the who people were coming so she was there now conversing the conversation turned to the question of whether one could see god they be said as the aroma of a flower is directly perceived by the nose so perceived by the mind at this point the master interrupted and said yes god is directly perceived by the mind then immediately he added but not by this ordinary mind it is the pure mind that perceives god and at that time this ordinary mind does not function a mind that has the slightest tris attachment to the world cannot be called pure friends the pure mind i always quote that from the jesus blessed that those who are pure in heart for they shall see god what is the purity most of the time we don't know we think that bathing in a holy water is purity or is a new or the washed clothes are the purity are smearing the body with the ashes the holy ashes purity purity means no attachment to these worldly things that is purity and if the mind is completely free from the attachment from the worldly things worldly objects where the mind goes to god and what is god purity and what is purity then to me purity is nothing but love purity is nothing but unselfishness again and again we have to remember the god is nothing but unselfishness god is nothing but love and love and unselfishness is purity and that is god so when we talk about the religion many of the things that jumble up in our mind we think we have to go on burning a light all the time we have to go over there beautiful we have to practice these that is all good all the religions are having the rituals and it is necessary to train up the body and the mind and when we are punishing the body to some extent it is good even in the buddha the gotama siddhartha in the beginning he was punishing his body then slowly slowly he understood so he then suggested mata pantha and not so much of austerity and not luxury it must be in between so that is the way most of the people they don't understand what is truly spirituality what is god and what are all these tapashas the pages of this gospel of sirama krishna is teaching us very clearly about that and that's why i say it's the panchama veda it is the veda the book of knowledge spiritual knowledge see here he is hearing a story as a book that is written by bankim chandra and going on commenting because the reader is the master master and others some devotees they are also listening they should not be carried out with the emotion the correct the things should be there spiritual because they are they are coming to sudama krishna for the development of the spirituality as a true teacher as a guru he is always alert to guide them here he is telling yes the pure mind but that pure mind doesn't mean this present mind then he is i if mind that has the slightest stress of attachment to the world cannot be called pure and what is this world these are all five things chakshu the nose the ear the tongue and the skin these are the five that goes out enjoy the world this is work if somehow something some attachment is therefore of this five five objects are there we cannot realize god and that cannot be said as a pure mind so how i will know that my mind has become pure i don't need not to go to any doctor to check my mind it's a critic no i need not to go only i can think of myself am i pure the mindfulness the word that has come and it is very very the modern day people they use it very much mindfulness what is this mindfulness constant i'm thinking anything i am interested to know about this world that is all right i keep information about this world it is all right but in the beginning itself again in the beginning of the spiritual life particularly those who are brahmacarians and the monks the arden brim the sannyasins those who have renounced the world and have taken up the life of a monk manticon they should be careful in their beginning at least 10 12 years not to keep any touch with the worldly things what is happening in the political world what is doing and who is increasing the salary these are nothing and nothing when your mind is you're under your control you can understand well then just for the information that's all because when you are working with the society you need the informations so that you are aware that much otherwise not so this is the way we have to understand the spiritual life means we drawing the mind from the worldly objects but those who are in the household duties those who are householders having their family children they must be very very careful about the the all the things that is happening all around them because that is their dharma they must be very much aware about how the money market is going on that is their dharma they have to protect their family but not with attachment for the monks never care for those should not be interested to know those because that is not their thing but the householders should be careful about those but without attachment that is the thing but anyway we should detest ourselves with the worldly things so in the beginning if we know it slowly slowly we are practicing it a time will come after the retirement i will withdraw my mind and i know what i'm actually doing and then finally i'll slowly try to detach to myself with all those i liked i loved that is called bana the brahmacharya and then godhasta afterwards the third stage banaprasthi is a returned life is a preparation but sannyasa sannyasa means complete giving up what i am giving up attachment to the worldly objects that's all not that i have to give up the earth and home all the time no attachment to the worldly objects if putting on the gerund then i am attached for the name fame power and i am running for the political offices then i am not a monk at all so this we should have to understand and this what krishna is mentioning us pure mind or pure atma is mentioning when all the impurities of the mind are removed you may call that mind pure mind or pure atma unfortunately some people born in a in india high caste and these that they think that they are pure and some people who were sweeping the road and doing some menial job they are impure wrong completely wrong so why i am mentioning this be if the teachings of the great souls the avataras are not helping to develop our day-to-day life so we should understand this truth then implement this use this truth to develop our social life at the same time spiritual life the sudama krishna is mentioning the pure mind means pure atman that is god there is no world and sometimes in hindi they say jaha ramtana he come where is god there is no desire worldly desire no god it says the author says a little that to that god cannot easily be perceived by the mind he says that one needs a telescope to have the direct vision yoga is the telescope yoga as it is described in the gita is the three kinds gyana yoga bhakti yoga karma yoga one is able to see god through this telescope of yoga and when he said like that srama krishna that is very good these are the words of the gita bhagavad-gita the is highly considered by the hindus that they considered the three spiritual book religious book the scripture very highly that is they call it the prasthana treya prastana means retiring prastanam is going out and what is that triad that three treya means three prastana exit exit from this worldly life the three scripture will help you one first is the veda that is upanishad and second brahma sutra there are so many punishers are there so the bash dev who actually classified the supernishas he he mentioned in a sutra form in aphorism one one line the bullet points what are their indubnitions that is called brahma-sutra and third is the bhagavad-gita in that dialogue between the bhagavan sri krishna and his disciple arjuna in a very simple way he has given all that knowledge so this is called prasthanath the three great books of the hindus the upanishads brahmasutra it's very difficult to understand upanishads because that never gives any explanation it tells the truth and brahma-sutra also the same upanishad in a very subtle way in a small small one one line and they will be explaining so the shankara and other philosophers they have given the narration explanation on those aphorisms but bhagavad-gita is very simple that's why bhagavad-gita each and every one they'll be reading in the even the i have i have seen over here in america the many ladies they are doctors they are professionals but they will be making a club like that an association and they will meet one place and chant the maybe 100 slokas or maybe the whole gita 700 slokas in one day gita paryana and it's very popular in all over india gita parayana they'll be reading from 1 to 700 so continuously by that way they memorize the whole 700 verses 700 slokas and they know many thing of the hindu philosophy because of the bhagavad-gita so suramar krishna is mentioning this is very good this is in the bhagavad-gita what is very good the telescope what is that telescope yoga how many yogas are there gyana then the bhakti and it says the gyana bhakti and karma here the book that we are reading now that is been mainly giving thrush on the karma what is that gyana in hinduism they always give freedom to choose your path sometimes some people are there were truly truly having the analytical mind and the majority of the people not understanding what is ghyana just go for that and then they ruin their spiritual life that they should not do and sudama krishna said those who are in the household those who are householders they have the responsibility of the family they must have to earn money should not go to practice the gyana margie why the gyana margies they constantly think they go on pondering thinking that i am not the body i am the soul so they never hanker for anything that they are the completely different ways their their practice is completely different first they decide now i am going to practice this and then one two three four seven steps are also there in the gyana yoga bhakti also there are seven steps are there i mean the bhakti is good why because the emotion that we are already having only channelizing those emotions towards god this is easy for all people that if you are trying the path of the gyana you have to leave the heart and home you have to leave everything 24 hours you have to go on pondering that i am the brahmana your relations with others and all that at the time of practicing nothing should be there otherwise hypocrisy may come that is the reason ramakrishna said it is not for all in the bhagavad-gita shri krishna said the path of ghana is very hard but pata bhakti is for each and everyone the bhaktivat one should follow along with the bhakti if you combine the karma that is the best path suggested by bhagavan sirama krishna for this present age because this is the path narada who was a gyani who realized the brahman at the same time he was a great devotee he was the best person to say so he said naradiya bhakti he gave a definition and this naradiya bhakti means constantly thinking of god you're performing your duties the householders you have to perform your duty you have the responsibility your dharma own responsibility religion is your duties you must perform that you should offer it at the feet of the god so you have the faith you have the belief you know this world is temporary even then you are working over there with a detached mind i know this is temporary but at this moment it is necessary so i am doing it so this is the way of anyone thinking and every day when you are going to bed in the night before that he is giving everything to the god and the second line we are studying the narada bhakti sutra every fast saturday of every month and i give the class of the hindu temple lemont still now the online classes are going on all these are there in in the youtube we are discussing very deeply thoroughly the how the narada is explaining this and when i for forget the god now i have gone to a party and have forgotten god no go over there mix with your friends and then say hello to everyone but within your mind you should go on remembering the god paramob when you are remembering god that will restrain you control you to do anything wrong any wrong thing will be controlled by the thought of god who god is present within my heart he is observing he is seeing everything so i should not do this i should not do that i am controlled by that way when i am controlled slowly slowly detachment comes from the worldly objects and when i am detached from the worldly objects not getting any attractions as we were just discussing the moment the mind becomes pure i get the joy of god a self-confidence the god is there someday i will surely talk to god see god face to face so that is the bhakti marga the bhakti the devotion combined with knowledge and work that is the best for the modern life the only gyana in particularly when people are so busy with the worldly thing their livelihood is very difficult the surama krishna is very happy that the author has mentioned this but what is the telescope of yoga why the telescope one pointed yoga means union union with god so the if you like to be united with god you have to be focused on that completely concentrated you should not deviate from these or that completely concentrated on the god that is called yoga so as if it is the telescope you are completely concentrated to find out what is this keeping any object that you like to study below that apparatus below that machine and you see that look at that try to understand it as the the scientists they do in the laboratories and writing down the oh this moment it changed the color that moment it is behaving like this is completely focused the same way one should constantly focus one's mind to god the gyana margie completely focused and he will go on constantly thinking apparently is very difficult to understand because they are not the karma yogis that that working they are not the bhakti-yogis that praying performing worship and crying for god nothing and they're not also the dhyana yogis sitting meditating and withdrawing the mind no just like any ordinary person they are behaving and sitting quietly in one corner of the room oh that man is just wasting his time he doesn't talk much he's not having the frame it that way we judging it to be a mystery great mistake the gyana yogi is constantly and that is why the gyana yogis are very rare then some that is the gyana yoga they are constantly focused i am not the body i am not the mind that's why when the gyanojak is mostly go on repeating that i am not the body i am not this mind i am not the i the constantly reminding themselves all these things the body that i am having and the ear the ether the [Music] ultimately comes and says i don't have any object what is my form nirakara without any form is my form so that is the way this is very difficult to conceive and to concentrate few people can do it and then comes the focus of bhakti yoga yatra yatra nitra they're focused on that they don't say anything else only god god everywhere everywhere that is god so this is the way then if you read the biography of one of the the swami's direct disciple of sri ramakrishna he was walking in the in the streets suddenly found that a boy is trying to get the attention of a girl and she he is singing that for a long time i didn't see you for a long time i didn't meet with you could talk to you like that you were singing and swami started crying what happened to you he remembered god i didn't talk to god for a long time i didn't see you oh my master for a long time he was remembering bhagavan sadam krishna with those words a devotee always anything immediately ignite that the god is not i i forgot the god how it is possible bhagavan krishna himself going and seeing a tiger as a lion immediately is not looking at the lion just by looking one's glands of the lion remembering god is durga constantly thinking of god looking at the boy who was standing in the form of as we see the images of krishna immediately not the boy but the krishna revealed within his heart that is constantly focused and that's why the telescope the author used the word telescope because it was that way modern so he was using this sadama krishna appreciated this to realize god first and foremost we have to have the faith god is there how it is possible then you have to go to the scripture you have to go to the pure soul pure mind the sannyasins that they call it satsangha means indeed is called and sanskrit also sangha means company what is the sat sat means eternal those who have already realized that god is eternal atman is eternal that is called sat and if you go to these people they will guide you properly because they don't have any selfish motive and they are not having only a narrow oh i realized in this way or i feel that god can be realized through this way so don't go to others rather criticize others and you should always think as i am thinking these people are also very dangerous the narrow mind the sectarian minded people no the real gurus are very broad-minded and they will guide you you love gyanomarga of course you should be but very careful be very careful that you are not deceiving yourself you are not deceiving yourself and then ultimately if you are deceiving it you will be a hypocrite and life will be a miserable and not only that in the in the name of god in the name of spirituality in the name of religion it will bring down this high the spiritual values very low just because of you so be very very careful they don't say bhakti yoga so whenever i take the name of god i cry is an emotion maybe you were crying for some other reason so be careful just flowing the tears doesn't mean that you are a great devotee are you truly crying for god or because of your emotion you are crying some people are very much emotional anything little immediately will bring so are you like that be careful about that so you have to analyze the bhakti doesn't mean the outburst of the emotion bhakti also mean am i truly stepping towards the right directions how i will know love will increase within me unselfishness will increase within me i will not ever feel jealous and that is why through the stories they always teach us the relation between radha and krishna completely that's through that story we always think oh this is a lover and the beloved not like that and you have to understand in the beginning radha was feeling jealous the krishna is with many and krishna was not with heart why the moment your mind is narrow sectarian and you are thinking god only belongs to you god leaves you so that is the way one should learn from these the gaudiya vaisnava shampradai they very much the way they express this love of radha is a very pure love what is this love only love for god for love sakes that's all i don't want anything else in return so when the radha realized that what she saw she saw god everywhere on the sky the wind she's looking at the sky and that color of this the cloud reminds her about the krishna oh crowds you must have seen my love my beloved the krishna so you have got this color and the flowers the butterflies the birds and the grasses each and everything was revealing only krishna that is the same way so telescope so one point so if we understand this way then the barrier of this is my god and my religion and that is their religion it breaks god is everywhere in every form with everyone i am blessed that i can think about god that's all i'm blessed so this is the way and the karma when we are going to help others and at the back of it if i am thinking that they should remember me that i am helping them i am giving my picture see i gave you this gift and with my picture and my name you should remember it hang it somewhere in your you know inside the room that is not karma that is maybe a karma but karma yoga is completely different the yoga the union union with god and what first step that teaches humbleness not me but thou with that humbleness i am blessed that you have accepted my gift hey poor man come i'll give you i'm giving you ten dollar by that way if i give i can give the person will also get maybe he will go to some the mcdonald and have a cup of coffee with your ten dollar but you are not going to get the blessings of god by that why because of the ego hey man take this dollar and thanks may no that should not be and you should be humble that's why bhagavan shami vivekananda said the giver should kneel down bhagavan sirama krishna also said if you see god in every being and serve them in that way this is the what he was mentioning the master that is very good these are the words of the gita aim at last the debbie chudarani met her husband she showed him great devotion and said to him you are my god i wanted to learn the worship of another god but i did not succeed you have taken the place of all gods the master suramar krishna smiling i did not succeed this is the drama of a woman totally devoted to her husband this also is a path this also is a path why because a woman dedicated to the husband and husband dedicated to the wife if they are faithful to each other that is called the grihastha dharma dharma righteousness it's a religion just because i give the word that i will protect my wife every time everywhere in every condition that's the husband is doing his dharma observing his dharma his responsibility that will make his mind pure just by that the wife is also giving the words to the husband that i will follow you as a shadow and that mentality will also purify our mind but this is the unique way the teachings are coming down what is the goal to purify our mind how to do it there are so many varieties and the best is swa dharma that's why in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna is mentioning as a long back in andaman in my office one lady used to come i have forgotten maybe she was from the france or some european country and she was visiting andaman she used to come and sit in my office most of the time used to speak in hindi and other bengalis indian languages but still she used to be there to listen and sometimes just because she was there i used to speak in english the one day i received a wedding card some devotees daughter because of her marriage they have invited me that is the custom to get the bliss so they have seen and it was a very costly and you know in indian marriages there will be and nowadays it has developed so much a beautiful card that lady was interested can i see what is that is because a butterfly was sitting the moment you are opening the butterfly as if is flying from there so that is costly so i gave it to her she went oh my god that is that they are going to marry each other oh that's good then she was interested to know in this our society how they arrange marriage then there was a gentleman was there elderly person and his wife they were also visiting me then they told that you know there will be uh the the boy's father will contact or the parents will contact the girls and the girls parents will then they will talk then they'll meet each other they'll be visiting each other's house and by that way one day they will decide the gurdians they will decide now well now let them get married that is the and then this type of date function will be arranged and people will be invited but the girl told the lady told oh my god are they not going to spend with each other to understand how they are before marriage at least five six months they should be together to understand whether they will be able to continue their life each with each other then the gentleman told no not like that nowadays if you they are doing but majority the marriages over here is arranged marriage and she told oh i cannot think of it how it is possible an unknown person marrying unknown girl how they will continue then the gentleman said ma'am i was in bombay and i received a postcard in the olden time postcard was there i don't know whether it's still there or not and my father wrote in bengali that your marriage has been fixed on such and such date come at least for ten days come five days before and leave five days after so 10 15 days take leave from your office from your job and come and get married i was very much afraid to talk to father in those days that was the custom so he wrote to his mother at least send me a photo of that girl whom i am going to marry what is it i am going to marry but i don't know the girl to the father and another postcard came i disown you as my son as because you are not believing in my words so you do whatever you like and marry whomever you like then ultimately i had to go i had to obey my father and this is the lady i married and that is last 40 years we are i think 30 35 years i'm continuing and that lady was really surprised but that is the way that goes together understanding each other understanding the likings and dislikings and respecting those and that is called dharma sirama krishna appreciating that this is also a path to realize god and this is the wonderful path and from that samsara slowly slowly the society human society is growing up the one must be very very careful it has become almost like a uh the funny game why like that boy i married and then after few days i'm not liking you go away another that is that way of course it is very very shallow or the only few people are doing like that as because they are popular people it is coming in the newspaper and all it is not happening in the whole society but one should be careful because the marriage is a very great responsibility and in the rig veda also it is mentioned so here suramar krishna is very happy that that particular lady who was driven out from her in-laws house because of some misunderstanding now our husband understood it he came he accepted her and now she is telling i was trying to get another god but you were there all we got sudama krishna smiled and accepted this is also a path and this way is going oh what a stage i passed through i passed some days absorbed in sheba and durga some days observed in radha and krishna and some days absorbed in shita and rama assuming radha's attitude i would cry for krishna assuming shita's attitude i would cry for rama sudama krishna is mentioning because he but this is the uniqueness of bhagavan's rama krishna the majority of the avatars as a male body they perform in that way but it is not the body it is the soul so how within that body one feels this the uniqueness ramakrishna felt he felt the pangs of the shita he failed in that way the great arch of the radha for lord krishna it's not that lady body woman body but the mind of that lady she is forgetting everything and concentrating on only krishna krishna krishna krishna my god my god my god so that's krishna appreciating and he is telling i used to practice that and the shiva and shakti and radha krishna rama shita but leela is by no means the last words passing through all these states i said to the divine mother mother in these states there is separation give me a state where there is no separation this is the unique and wonderful way it is mentioning suramar krishna is telling that if you are having the duality obviously there will be separation so one should go beyond that and radha and krishna when they are becoming one there is a beautiful song and he is mentioning when the radha and krishna becoming one there is only the god that remains it is not the male form what is the female form is only the consciousness that is the self the pure self and that unity is after practicing all this not note over here that he is practicing all this no one else did do did it before no avatara did that's why swami bibekan they said not out of emotion because of all this thank you friends the bhagavatama krishna is asking us urging us to reach to that situation where one always feels that it is that god it is not separate it is not to aham brahmas me i am that i am that consciousness and sometimes he feels i am that god the god that i was worshiping and slowly i have completely transformed into that god it is not that form but the consciousness we will read from there in our next class let us see if there is any question the first question is from jayanti ghosh she is asking i don't have any specific mantra diksha so i chant a mantra like myself but my mantra is not always chanted as a result of reading bhakti sastra so what is the point of reading bhakti sastra um it's not very clear i'm sorry to say the question bhakti sastra gives you or teaches you the devotion to god but if you have the the love for that particular god it's any any form of god god is one but any form of god and you are taking that name of that god with great love and at the same time thinking all the qualities of that god then it is all right but it is suggested that you should go to a guru receive a mantra so that your mind becomes one and usually our tradition that one should listen to the words of the guru so the great respect is given to the guru by thank you we learn the bhakti-sastras at the are teaching us how to develop devotion love for god now your first part of the question and which god you love that is your choice all are different forms and names but if you love ganesha durga or the kali or krishna or rama just go on praying oh god please be with me please be with me that will help you and you will find a solace a peace thank you same question same part two question jointly goes she's asking again i read devotional scriptures all the time and that's why my parents think that if the monetism in me goes away i will become a monk how can i overcome this fear of them how can i understand that my spirituality is improving or that is the fear always the another parents and they love us so much so obviously they always feel that we should be always with them though suppose a son gets a job in the foreign country goes away stay over there maybe once in a while coming back and meeting the mother or father is happy that he is there the same son if he goes to bellarmort to become a monk lives nearby maybe the parents are in calcutta and the son is living in bellarmore only the other bank of the ganga but still they think oh he has gone away as because they don't have the idea about the monastic life that is the reason so you tell them that no i am not going to become a monk or i mean a non or anything but i like to develop my life in a very disciplined and moral way then they will understand and appreciate the next question from sunni of energy she is asking maura how can we keep our mind calm during adverse situations in life oh this is a very good question but you know that the only way is to pray when the adverse situations are coming then you have to go on praying to god god i know you are the only being and because of you only things are happening and when these adverse situations are coming it is a challenge coming before me you were doing it but why what wrong have i done and suppose i have done please forgive me by that way if you pray then you will become very calm the anger with other people thinking they're creating the problem that will go away and slowly slowly problems will also be solved so that is the only way the next question is from kamal chaudhary he is asking how can consciousness exist without mind consciousness exists without mind what is mind if the consciousness is not there that that consciousness is there everywhere always and the mind is nothing but an agitation on that consciousness so kamal babu if you know about this the consciousness was there is there will be there and that is why in the upanishad the rishis after realization of this consciousness they say sat sat means eternal unchanging all the time and all anything and everything is changing so the mind is also changing mind is also you see when you were a child how used to think when you were a young man how you used to think i don't know your age if you are of my age we are thinking in a different way the same mind changing that means one day it mind me go away but the consciousness which is reflecting on our mind our buddhi that will be there so consciousness is the base all other things are superimposed on consciousness that is them thank you friends to let us say shanti three times o mushanti [Music] namaste
