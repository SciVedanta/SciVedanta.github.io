[190: Panchama Veda 190: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna: Seven Steps Of Devotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzI2924NjP4)

good evening let us begin with this mantra topic at home little dr. G venom Kobe Billy rhythm Calma sharper struggle among golem Sri Madhavi greener the food Arjuna today we will study do you see how salam o krishna is explaining seven stages of devotion we usually know the eight steps of the Dhyana yoga and seven stages of Gyana yoga today we will see how the ramakrishna wonderfully explaining the seven stages of bhakti yoga the last in our last class we discussed about the yoga cinema Tichenor was very clearly he was narrating how from the Kula Kundalini slowly that power is going out on the top of the head and they are marching with that supreme so the dead power is cuckoo Kundalini and coming to the central part of the spinal cord the Yogi's the see that there is a suzuna check that line it goes and mix it at the top of the head and but then he was explaining as in the tradition how the one after another in every steps then the stages how the flowers who were opening up and on the top of the head it is merging then he said that go bees to attain the knowledge of Brahman he explained the knowledge of Brahman that also we started last time we discussed about but they were not seeking it they wanted to enjoy God looking on themselves as his mother or the frame or his handmaid or lover so as we know the Hinduism is approaching towards the supreme goal through different paths and this are mainly three major plants three paths is the path of knowledge path of devotion and paired up meditation this tree so he is describing here the gopis apparently they are so simple but they attain the knowledge of Brahman but they never liked it so this is reported the complete freedom is there for the devotee devotee or the person who is trying to realize God not that all the time it is through the path of knowledge it is according to your test you like to enjoy so the cookies and the he wanted a group of people the bounds they were sitting over there with this ramakrishna and as i last time told that it is also a path sadhana they considered their body as the main and slowly slowly they go on telling through the songs that I am NOT the body I am not that this mind so they go beyond the body and mine that is the asana a technology but through mixed with devotion and they'll be going on expressing that through songs and dances there's a special part and here you find those people after listening to Saddam initially started singing but the song was like a different time what in the song they are singing we are sceners Redeemers o merciful Lord so that was the meaning of the song we are sinners Redeemers o merciful God ceramic dish now he is now telling to the devotees it is the attitude of a beginner to worship God out of fear so look at it how when we are afraid of God we have so many things to do and we are afraid that somebody over there looking at us in Punishers or reorders so naturally they're constantly considering in that way they're calculating when we are going to worship God the calculation is I can go and please him offering some food or player and all that so that I'll be protected by him that's the first step if we have read or if you read the story of a young God who is going to Yama because his father asked him to go then a Chiquita his fast free and was that when the Yama who is very happy the god of death and he said you have come to and you waited for three nights and three days for me I will give you three boons asked what he wanted the first was me my parents be in a kind of tranquility because they may be constantly thinking about me and may they know that I am here and they should be happy they they let them sleep up early and when I go back they should recognize me so that was a very calculative way of praying the first when the people begin with the relation with God the journey towards God the journey to was the supreme the thing is like this only and cinema teacher said no this is not a good attitude please sing about God realization songs expressing divine joy when I was young I joined this monastic order and we used to learn the big songs but to Bengali songs I was born there in God sir and one son was very very common people is to like the devotees is to like and that was written by a great point and singer and after expressing that song he committed suicide etcetera and it says that I might desire is not fulfilled Oh mother and all my dreams are shattered it is not complete but I can understand that these are limited and I only so why I am going to go is a soul of dispassionate Bengali most of them they would seem amar Shah Donna Michaud Nami Teela Arshad Nepali though the desire and the dreams and not complete and they will sing with all emotion and the meaning is not good so when I joined when the Xiaomi wished to call him second show me who was here in America the Shunta Lupin and the G many of you know you and herei don't think this song I sang this song with create emotion sitting in the shrine he said don't sing this song this is not for us he had a great life you should join the Raptor dedicate yourself to Taku enjoy the company of tar cool pretty to him Oh God please reveal yourself that type of song this what decide you have only one desire to realize God so why you should think so then I started thinking even in the prayer even in the devotional songs there's a different division differences are there so Salam o Krishna over here in peace pipe zero one in the gospel of Salaam o Krishna he is telling that how will the sand that song the mother D at Naveen neo keys house he's this word he is telling to brother disciple be drunk who might be drunk with the wine of heavenly please the dejar then another devotee suddenly asking said won't you see geometrician was a very good singer and used to express his joy his experiences his knowledge of religion true songs also so he the moment it is said that he was actually in the mood of the yoga then he was explaining through the knowledge so we have great previous pages and suddenly he said that about the devotion ceramic isness answer what shall I sing well I missing when the spirit moves me this is the attitude of a devotee when we are singing the devotional song is not to please the people most of the time the singles main attention it remains to please the people no it should be to satisfy God and satisfy that yourself the signal so that satisfaction should be because of all the song those words that are coming out and then in a team that is going out through the teaming that means your prayers are going out to reach the God that's controversial song and he was okay when the spirit moves me then he was closing his eyes then after some time he began to sing and master Masha is writing his eyes were turned upwards is taking the mind inside he's looking outward not the people who were listening I am NOT singing for you but my devotion is connecting me with God he first he sang buddy this is the uniqueness of the ramakrishna first he sang a song that is dedicated for the devotion which number he was talking about the Gora Gora mr. Jatin amar Prabhu so that is that song second song he sang chapter there's the cardi and the last song he is saying is the parameter and in the big and is describing Oh mother what a machine is there ask meat machine means this human body Oh mother what a machine is dead without meat and what is this machine in the Vedanta we know punch a kosher meal optional art MA the beautiful the wonderful this human body human being we do not understand that sometimes we are good-looking sometimes we are strong and sometimes we are having some money and the social status and we are very very proud but that is very very outward expressions main is the God is reflecting within power but they intellect in our mind that is the very special thing and only human being can realize it understanding but how here the Vedanta comes forward to help us and they are giving us the how this body and then afterwards afterwards afterwards according furniture OSHA election art mom election is behind what is that Hartman and Hartman is the source of our apartment the consciousness but you have to cross the five gates the pipe sets pipe covered puncture motion the fine cover first cover is Inouye on this body with the flesh and blood and bone and man this is the first one and whole our mind our attention goes to this body only majority of our time is given to this body only to maintain this body then monomial pranamaya very tijuana wire anandamaya pain beyond the anandamaya is the hot one we reach to those people who understand this deepest if they go they analyze and they give up give up give up and then they ultimately reach to Arnold Amaya kosha majority of the people the stuff over there and there in great joy because the deflection is so much over there but even the under Mayan culture is not also the original joy under that there is a different discussion some day we will be discussing this time in September I am trying to give a retreat on the search for the infinite all these subjects will come out there the details discussion about Anna Maria pranamaya on underwear how the Jardin de Meyer when a manual create joy is in really not the joy from outside but still under Maya kosher is not the Hartmann so we can understand the subtlety when we have to reach the ceramic dishes through the salt he is expressing that idea Oh God Oh mother what a great thing that you have made this machine is it is a wonderful machine why he mentioned machine in the song because it is not the original it cannot take any decision only because of the reflection this is do you know so this is the machine as Saddam additional sang the last song he wind into Samadhi this is also very very special of salaam additional green new samadhi can imagine those who have studied the knowledge of samadeva calendar or the Patanjali Yoga darshan and we have discussed that the I think one or two years it took to complete all the why should we meditate over that we discussed and there the final stage is the Samadhi and the Samadhi I become Heda God and there is no I remain it becomes only he and that is the complete stage or the last tail of the yoga path Salam o Krishna goes over there just at ease any time he goes he was singing and the earth when he was singing this body is a machine the unique machine he immediately mind went to the punch Akash of election art naam at the fight the beyond the five sets is that great Hartman his mind went into admin merged into Hartman he went into Samadhi the devotees they said speechless gazing at his radiant figure after some time he regained the partial consciousness the mind most of the mind is still over there little bit can't come down sometimes you you know those who are practicing meditation you suppose you are practicing for one hour two hours and when you get up then if someone comes to talk to you you don't feel like talking because their mind has not come down you have practiced and intensely you practiced now slowly your mind is coming down not that we wink into Samadhi only a little practice right the mind became concentrated even then after that when you are getting up we don't like to communicate we don't like to listen anything and even you don't like to see anything why mind is still over there and imagine when we merges with a Brahmin that artment that joy the absolute the one original then from there in the mind is coming down to all this the person who is having their the golden driller is very costly jewelry's when they go to the shops where like the original jeweler is but it's not how you feel how she feel is like that you only touch it having the original one the trail all very costly precious now why to look at the fixed so it looks like that so that when the mind goes to God and when it comes down and you look at this this fake thing this world we don't like it so that's a master of the money they we she advised don't get up immediately after practicing the meditation for sometime don't get up immediately wait for some time just sit over there for some time and slowly slowly your mind will come down and sometimes what when I was trying to contact that supreme I could not in that meditation when I was quietly sitting suddenly that happens and the great revelation comes experience comes so wait for some time then slowly get up Saddam hawkish nurse mind by this experience or by this discussion we can to some extent understand what was the condition of the mind of zero-emission he went into Samadhi when he was singing the song that beyond all this pancha kosha the fights aids the brahman paramatma and after that marching from there coming down is very very difficult so partial he has come down and slowed his talking mother cinema Krishna soliloquizing he is not addressing anyone soliloquizing his mother please come down from up there now remember cinema Krishna said very clearly whom you call Brahman I call mother the way he is addressing the mother it is the problem and he is asking that Brahman please come down because you have asked me that I have a mission to fulfill if my mind go birches in the problem and when I will work I have to talk to the people I have to enlighten them I have to go them so that's why mother please come down from up there tt filled his mind still lingering in the seventh plain consciousness seventh plane of consciousness because the Samadhi so much Tinashe he is mentioning commenting from the terminology of the yoga seventh plane of consciousness the gyani will say Chatterton the fourth one the slowly slowly goes to third Frosty's waking States dream states dreamless condition and then go to the fourth that is the chest to determine the to do so here is this seventh stage of consciousness so we can understand please actually using the you garden allergy friends when you are reading the gospel of cinema Schnurr you must have to have someone with sincerely reading mom's tapped East knowledge it is so difficult apparently it is so easy the easiest book has healed we begin our spiritual journey by reading this book sometimes some people they also suggest go and bring the gospel of the artist but in every page there's so much of discussions of their in-depth thoughts are there unless and until you have a background of the yoga the knowledge Gianna and also devotion is very difficult to understand please do come down he saved don't determine mean that will be still mother and sit down now he is talking with that supreme consciousness as mother and asking to quiet Oh model everybody's future is determined by the tendencies of his previous births this is the statement everybody's tendencies tendencies means the carnival ah and we call it some scar in Sanskrit ecology some scar tendencies and suddenly some person there is a miracle gentleman he works very hard but his devotion to the gods ramakrishna and if you talk to him he's just mad for Salam o Krishna all the time he is thinking of ramakrishna writing poem about him and sending to me and constantly thinking I can't go because I have a job to do but my mind was there anywhere performing the salaah additional puja and there in the night he has composed a claim dedicating to see ramakrishna american they were heard of indian things and even those big temples at the arab Ramachandra Bishnu and other ramakrishna we don't have any temple only this type of belong to societies that also no name of surrounding anywhere began to societies how could he know about cinema teach them how could he come to us how could he get the initiation and then he is going on reading books is a very hardworking does it not prove that the past but something must he must have done so he was attracted to the purest of the pure spiritual path so this is this so here see Ramakrishna after coming down from the supreme condition he looked at the people and in different places I can see the tendencies of the people as one can see things in a glass case Albina through the glasses we can see one of the things we are inside a mirror and here also ceramic is taken see the mind can read the mind and he is telling mother everyone's future is determined by the tendencies of his previous births or should I say to these people nothing can be achieved without discrimination and renunciation so the discrimination the bechara this is a great thing that has been given to human being only animals cannot do that even when they are doing only comparing with the food and the security and nothing there else but human being can discriminate between the permanent and the temporary so that discrimination and the moment we know that these are all temporary things we draw turbine from the temporary and put it in the permanent that's called renunciation sadhana Krishna had now regained full consciousness of the world and he continued there are many kinds of renunciation there's all different end of a condition of the mind one of them may be called market by rakia they say many people they know marketer means monkey the computer coincidence monkey renunciation it is a false enunciation stimulated by affliction of the world that an innovation doesn't last long then there is a real renunciation a man with in the world lacking nothing feels all to be unreal she's a to create suddenly something happened in addictive there's a story when the battle mode was in a very primitive condition a gentleman came and he wanted to donate all his property so the manager of the because he is organizing everything he needs the money so he was happy so he went to detain president Shami brahmananda then brahmana Nagi immediately didn't see the man he never met the man immediately understood the you know that his wife passed away the man wants to give all his property to the Buddha Ramakrishna mission immediately permanent that he said Babu Rhonda he has come to us and develop the renunciation and in his company you are developing attachment when he feared not he understood that this is only through affliction this moment his mind wants to give everything and go away because he was missing his wife so much the world became nothing but after few days he came back he told one of my papers so give it back so like that it goes so that skull marker to wait out here the monkeys renunciation this moment I think I should keep in the naft or some time now and there is a renovation of calculation they renounce the game but after law of calculus and third is this one may not care for anything I love God and I go away for God God will take care of me and true need happens and the life of the Swami is equally loop particularly many many Swami's it happens if once you accept that God God will take care of you for sure and if you are leaving your parents your family if the bad god and take care of them for sure it happens many many times even then 100 percent believe in faith in the existence of God is not coming so that is cinema Krishna is explaining it is not it is not possible to a cure in incision all at once see how practical he is the time factor must be taken into account but it is also to imagine hear about it when the right time comes he will say to himself oh yes I heard about this he's giving the hint about it it's better to go and listen about it but that very moment you are not ready but you know about it with the triangles okay I can give it to my friends here I must say sometimes some people out of emotion they give away everything and go out no you had to wait for the time factor automatically it will go down from you automatically or otherwise you must have to save something so that that can help you in few you must be very proud when we are reading when once become a mom a different type of mentality comes attitude comes the burning renunciation fathers were nothing but when you are in some responsibility you have to calculate you have to know what I am going to do if you read the Gospels in our Krishna you will find the same thing when the master Marcia the writer of this he was the recorder we should say he used to record of the conversation he wanted to that he discloses explained desire to become a bomb the Saddam patient said knowledge should not and then he was calculating asking to calculate you have a son you have a wife you have this how much expenditure and how much you are having in the bank and the property so that they can survive in the future afterwards because that is the responsibility also so it's very very practical way we have to think and cinema Krishna is stating you must also remember one thing my constantly hearing about renunciation once desire for worldly objects gradually wears away one should take rice water in small doses to get rid of the intoxication of Nicholson son Krishna knew this too also so the some people would be drinking a lot and then he must have seen somewhere so he is mentioning the if you wash the rice there are eyes then that water if they drink that intoxication it goes away that he is mentioning over here but don't I am NOT going to try it anyway so here he is telling in this way and Anna's parent entitled to the knowledge of God is very rare he the Raghavan Gita also it mentioned with the sedition and aspirin in tightly to the knowledge of God is very dear what is the knowledge of God you know the every month we're meeting in the our Hindu temple the amount every first Sunday of the month and there we are discussing the austro-prussian material you started the first chapter we have studied second chapter if you read many of you have already read and hard that's a wonderful pollicis know where you can find no religion in supporting but the air it sees Who am so great I offer my chronometer myself because that is the way the expression of the disciple after realizing the truth the disciple engraved joyously why I am so great I offer all my respect myself can you imagine and that is the height of the Vedanta highest point but it is not for all we have to understand we know understanding it good hearing is good have that knowledge but know for sure when he was standing from the air you have to start so that he is telling is very rare it is said in the Gita that one in the thousands desires to know God and again that among thousands who have such a desire only one is able to know him Manu Xian arms are strange to see deity seated very famous sloka as your attachment to the world diminishes you spiritual knowledge will increase this line we should remember what is the difference between those people the great Souls only this much as your attention to the worldly objects diminishes go away the moral spiritual become what is the spirituality why suddenly one person Xiaomi bb-gun was born and then he went to schools then he went to call it just a normal life so many people are doing like that suddenly how it is that he became so great and the whole world started offering pranaam to him and respected him and accepting him as a spiritual leader this only giving away the world automatically you become religious and what is that world anything that is temperate anything including your body mind intellect so the time point you have to remember the more you give away the more you become spiritual sadhana Krishna is mentioning every line of the Gospels Rama Krishna is so important for the aspirins so the functional valency the name I have given the many people they always write to be white and generally they are good see these are the things every line you will find the knowledge the wine are the beta teaches at the knowledge knowledge of spirituality here also we learned as your attachment to the word diminishes is spiritual knowledge will increase attachment to the word means he is explaining again attachment to the world means attachment to lust and gold the desire say Ramakrishna using two words Marshall the Manatee we used only one more someone as the question to her mother how to realize God the moment you were free from desire he will realize God so that desire the last it is not him every body able to fill the Prima serum vision are entering into the realm of devotion is a different world he is mentioning it is not given to everybody to feel prema a static love of God jatin experience did an ordinary man can at most experience power through the terminologies they're using one is prema and another is power the person who is going on practicing devotion ultimately you can go up to Baba what is that tamago acceptor he will explain only issue forties of the divine incarnations experience prema when prema is awakened the devotee not only feels the world we are real but forgives even the body which everyone loves so intensely now here will stop and go back to a few lines back where he mentioned knowledge is so difficult and only if you can really follow the path of knowledge and here it is telling in the devotional path to reach to prema one has to become as pure as the incarnations of God themselves Aarti not seen and what is the DePrima win the prema that particular aspect of devotion and when it comes in the mind of a human mean what happens the then he forgives everything this world which is unreal and not only that it forgives his body put that love he loved so much he forgives even the body which everyone loves so intensely this is the same then comes prema is the role by which you can tie the card we need what you want to see you can just pull them and the God will appear before you the way he express it as it is so easy the prema is that rope whenever you want you can pull it and God and come before you so like these only he's telling the matcher he the in the dream of stages and the mature stage of bhakti is power when one attains it one remains speechless thinking of Tsuchida and this also we should not the person is approaching through the path of devotion and devotion means duality the god and me are i separate here you stand when you started so god is there here and i listened to the about god and then start believing and developing attachment love interest curiosity and slowly slip mistake i go towards god and ultimately i used to the point which is termed as power and in that Harbor condition see Ramakrishna stilling he thinks only about such cheat on and this see there is no to it becomes one the path of devotion also taking us to the same one because the Indian philosophy Indian religion they are giving different options which even you like you can take but you complete the course you reach to the same particular knowledge which is one not to most of us the Hindus also we don't know so we think that our God is these your God is that sometimes they become very narrow-minded I went to Temple and our devotees wanted to have a small room inside the big temple some of the rooms so can you give a small room for us so that we can count every 15 days we can see them read the gospel and no no no this is not our God uses different God there Hindus but still the same about what is totally different if you worship this God okay that is you are allowed but if you're worshipping salam krishna's god we don't know him where you are not allowed so that is the way the thing my god your God is God our God all different and how you explained so Saddam acoustically they have not started even they have not began to journey even they just trying to understand things they the moment that gospel of ceramic Pistons not for only group of people who are the followers of slavish anyone Jane will be trying to understand spirituality in any religion anywhere anytime must read this book why they know only if you read it with the open mind you can understand the truth of it and he says when one attains one remain speechless what is attending the power and what is that power the condition of the mind goes into that the thinking of such it on under such a Don under the feeling of an ordinary man can go only that far the power ripens it becomes Muhammad Dean comes the prema in the last so he was telling about dream I started with the prema and he said only change the no ma prabhu a personality like those only care majority of the people and there are some great people and they are reaching up to that the Baba and in the power their realizing the satchitananda that oneness and after that comes mahabhava the unity prema once there how can i devotee 8 in such love he is telling first the company of the holy man here we find the path of knowledge you all know there is the system of not these not this when you are going to following the path of knowledge it says not these not these this body no it is not mine no it is not this universe no it is not now easy eating sensitive is called neatly kneading and then it goes to in the path of devotion et et this one this one everything that I see is the manifestation of God so this only two different attitude one is this not this it is something else and another says that is nothing but God God has created universe everything that you see is nothing but the manifestation of God so this is the difference one person he was practicing the path of knowledge so he made the small heart he was practicing with the side of the river and then he knowed Soham saw that aha I am he so that was his practice so every day used to say swarm so on another person who was nearby he was practicing devotion he didn't like it every day after taking the birthing that river used to pass and used to see that this man has written other on the kill he wondered so on so one day the man was not there he mentioned there dah-dah-dah so long and he's this man wrote so long I am he and the devotees Road I am ease the Swami's and the son went up to God dasu as amiss the servant that is humble so again this man came and then he even brush the dog and there is so on again he came and wrote da so da and so it went on like this this is a little story but actually when they wish to the ultimate goal and finally realized what they realized same thing only my attitude to see God in play and another we doubt anything this much so cinema Disney is explaining and he is going on in a lastly I just mentioned and then maybe someday Felix go on discussion about it first tape of the devotion seven stages of devotion first stage that is called sadhu sanga company of the bullies are do Sangha it is sadhu sanga means now we are having the solution not the time Imam so not that we are reading the gospel of Salah focused and we are not thinking anything else we are listening either words I am just reading it out that's all and and we are listening to his words transporting our mind to that condition trying to understand as maximum as possible and slowly one thing is happening positively what is that we are forgetting ourselves we are forgetting the surroundings we are forgetting this world and we are waiting with those words as Ramakrishna said if you can get that particular condition which is known as prema and you will be completely merged in God even in the problem they are seeing the Tsuchida Ananda and mahabhava you can imagine that he is no longer separate from God he is with God and what happens in the prema they say when you realize then only film is difficult to express it is not possible I am talking about the devotional palette not about the path of knowledge not about the path of yoga devotional path first begin with this is called salut Sangha second come Serta feed in the existence of God faith in the existence of God one couple came with this Sun at the Sun is starting in fourth grade or fifth grade he never likes the wrong kind naturally born in America not so here but the parents don't force the boy he comes in homes around the boobs and he sees and then I when they returned back he commented the man you met over there in the Vedanta Society is a good person so this is judgment why I offered him the candies then I patted even I told how are you so he liked it may be in this way only it begins then when the first Association at the holy then comes earth thought we start accepting the God is there the Santa right means to mister mister means the single-minded devotion and we go to discharge today the next is our mother next to some other no you cannot develop that devotion in that way once we have accepted this I accepted this and I am doing to complete in this way Raghavan cinema business he is getting so many that way explanations and through stories the one man who is going on digging the will for the drinking water and the person who is also digging he dug some time and then he found the known who water only tried that again he went somewhere somewhere he could not reach to the ultimate level the where the water is mine but the first man went on digging and digging until I reached to that layer where water I'm not going to stop and he ceased were there in the spiritual life is also like that first you read understand then accept and except for whole life I am going to dig into this I only that is called mr. single-mindedness and what happens you know before we go to the another stage the fourth stage of the devotion all our past Karma's which brought me over here it came the bad Karma's this start manifesting and it give us a wonderful thing which is called ego spirituality I know how these things I can talk to other people and I have realized these I have realized that I can understand this thing better very subtle way this ego comes and covers our mind and takes away from the path while you start our own ass Dhamma I will start my own people that is the problem it comes so we do not understand we are thinking that we are practicing religion rather than talking to other people but when I am Telling am talking you will feel that man's unless and until you get the permission you're not supposed to talk about God when Shami be bigger than the man like him he had that experience system and as power generated within him and he transmitted it to his one of his guru by just to understand what how things happen so he told him in touch my body and touch my me and feel what is happening he was very dating and his brother disciple he touched him and he transmitted his spiritual power to him Raghavan Ramakrishna who was lying down in his room immediately understood it and when the norine enter tell what you have done it was just accumulating and you have spent the whole thing so this is the very very difficult Mista when the devotion has come everyday right moment I am going and meditating and praying and slowly slowly a satisfaction start coming and I by mistake understand that take that our great religious feelings no promised accounts devotion bhakti so fast the sadhu sanga strata Mista and then comes on the fourth stage bhakti then the journey begins from here and this love devotion to God means you won't like to talk anything else the moment that some people are talking about the God you feel like crying playing why as if you have you are separated from you beloved one for a long time that bangs that comes in the mind that is called devotion then come baba what is this baba you all those wonderful qualities of the God we love slowly comes on you you feel like that that's called bhava mahabhava you can imagine he's completely transformed into that and about the prema this it is impossible to talk about it so these are the seven steps friends we may some other time we will discuss about it maybe sombitch names different places he'll be explaining so we know the three different paths the iana they are also having the seven steps and Yoga there are also the seven stages and then comes the up team the deep ocean there are also seven stages it begins very nicely with the sadhu sanga the company of the holy so from there it begins and ended up but transforming himself as God supreme today you stop over here and again in there next Friday Tuesday even read about other words of John is not much that is complete this need and gentleman did become very sharp at our [Music] Father Misha medium Tom long Krishna [Music] Sheila's are Oh Chandi Chandi Chandi hurry you that's earth sri ramakrishna eponymous too
