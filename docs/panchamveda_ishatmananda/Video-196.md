[197: Panchama Veda 197: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna : God Is Beyond The Vedas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OttUzdbDCL8)

homonym copywritten Keshava struggle among three Muharram bubi Grinnell the bully dodging ah last Tuesday we heard about Saddam Krishna when he said God go beyond both knowledge and ignorance go beyond both knowledge and ignorance this very unique way of teaching so all the time they say always travel in the path of knowledge but here is one who said go beyond the knowledge to spiritual knowledge is the information about the god of the truth it can help us only up to go to right direction that much here is a map only to one person saddam krishna in different places in the same gospel of the Rama Krishna he say the one person received an instruction that you have to reach over there by this way man he utilizing the we nearest over there what he will do with the piece of people he had no use so he throws it away similarly the knowledge though it is containing in the reader but the beta unity was the knowledge of God conception of God redeemed but not the knowledge of God that is very important Sumi thousands of people are studying Veda researching and Veda in universities the students are also reading some of the scriptures have they all realized God at the truth at the grammar so that is very important leaders are massive knowledge experiences expressions of the realized Souls so that much we were reading the record of the September 14 1884 in English book there is page 522 saddam Krishna was talking with Sartre this sadaqa means the one who is trying to realize God here the master ma che perhaps he didn't know the name of the person so he is again and again mentioning as-sadiq allah why because that man is not like any other house he was dedicated dedicated for this particular purpose to realize God that is called sadaqa and that's what master Michelle mentioned about and master Masha wrote that Noreen river singing that we mentioned last time here all the conversation is going on people who are sitting over there and after the conversation and suddenly in between must the Saddam fish the master asked his beloved disciple Narendra not to see and not in the sand this is see how it's an old our must almighty is passed by so heartily been integrally this is a very famous song jobbing he he did know Ahmad before literally utterly in vain so till we find that of course I was trying to count to it here that they had meeting the Narendra sank six songs and very important songs when he is singing the all the full song translation is there in the English book do we find that the advanced ceramic Tichenor you should notice it when the Narendra was singing the sadaqa he closed his eyes and he was trying to meditate on those words but the words Oh God Oh Lord am I going to lose all my days in vain utilizing all my Daisy what is the real means the human birth which is very rare which we have achieved because of the past good Karma's now being a human again understanding that this life is illusory temporary and understanding that there are paths of the earth by which one can realize God and go all this button deck circle the temporariness even him I am not doing anything not trying do not understand anything for them it is okay in San si they addressed Impala the children Bolognese the children dear like the children okay they're happy with the games and these and dad but that is a different thing but renewal grown-up your vacuum and not only that your understood that there is a truth and that truth can be achieved in this very life and the same thing we find in the instructions of the Lord Buddha the Buddha is also telling the same just to re re Satriani the four truths our ears are the real truth what are the four truth this world is full of misery and it has a cause the misery has a cause one can go beyond the misery and there is a path for that these are the for the same thing again and again through different way coming to us the full of misery who will understand it who has a disability capacity he will only understand otherwise not that those who are stucked in anamcara at the illusion the constantly thinking though that man is having a 30-story building and I am having only 25 I must make mine a bigger building than like dislike the competition of the time trying to be in the someone in the whole world name should be on the top I'm the richest man how much you the wealth that I'm having I don't know but I am the richest man all this is going on suddenly some day something happened and he is no more what will happen to you all the regions what will happen to all those things temporary things most of the people they do not understand but a very few those who understand even after understanding these if they go on criticizing others comparing with others and wasting their time for many other things so one young lady she whenever she talks with me can it be still when I am going to realize the guard then sometimes mentally I say I wish I could do so so they really appreciate the eagerness she is a difficult decision problem I was telling her that I will play to model for you so all the problems are was no no no delay the problems with the end that is not that is we all right I'll manage when the problems at their inserts at their different things so I can remember mother but not for all to solve these problems but to realize core can imagine and the people around hard do not understand that I told you a really really blessed at this type of eagerness we never going to realize God can ID him as God in this guy right told that I am going to come visit India in 2020 I don't like to leave so long this isn't so many months at there if the mother gives me liberation in one or two months violent to leave this body so eagerness is so much in everywhere everything only one pointed like the brick sheet king pariksit was the team and he was from what background imagine even then he is only one how I should liber8 I get the liberation so that was the here jabbing hey Dino Ahmad people actually Oh Lord must of all my days pass by so utterly in vain master see ramakrishna was observing the faces of the devotees how what are the reactions after listening to this world that's Ithaca he was meditating then if I find a beautiful description when that Siddhartha was meditating since Saddam additional note is dead it was four o'clock in the afternoon the rays of the Setting Sun fell on his body the body of the sadaqa Saddam Tichenor quickly opened an umbrella and placed it near the door so that the Sun might not disturb the sava God the God is helping the people who are trying to realize God so this is simple is very small and very almost nothing anything but so significant the God is trying to protect the sonica anyone trying in whatever manner a little manner it sincerely trying immediately all the blessings and the protections and the guidance of the God will come with this small incident that has been recorded by the master Messiah it has been proved the God tries to protect the sad occurs and define of that is not in the same nearly six songs then finally three nice and that how full of please thou art big trees aren't to the Jay they are mine they are mine is very difficult to translate that all the exact big words so they have translated in this way with tree onto D actually the big other words they are my they are my J means glory victory as the understand the last line Saddam pistol student still observed in Samadhi when the songs are going on he went into Samadhi now sometimes the people they come the scene they saw merriment and entertainment people they appreciate or some devotional songs but still people over a cup of tea or coffee will be sitting and listening and enjoying but do we truly go according to the meanings of those words that they are singing if we can that is called musical meditation what the mihrab I used to do dancing used to do so these days to meditate on those words narendra is to do some business to do when they are singing those words like a prayer pouring out and they're forgetting all including their body and mind and only think in those words we were so kind so compassionate Oh God so that is the way meditation it doesn't mean that all the time you have to close your eyes and blues your breathing that is the process but this is also the Ramprasad kamalakanta now so being so meaning these to sing and we singing mister meditate on those words the every evening when you sing over here kundan Baba bong Tana jag abundant upon the divine the cut asunder of the bondages that is finding me every evening if we can really pray because that was composed by Swami Vivekananda every words are so holy a so encouraging kundan of abundant honor that is the prayer imagine that the God is cutting asunder all the advantages all your attachments all your ego and taking you to liberation so that has healed Lee we're singing then afterwards slowly slowly ceramic piston came down and then he himself started singing fears not introducing one or two more but not in the not because six songs alone so cinema Tichenor in that mood he sang a beautiful song mother this is the brief that solely grips my heart that even with deal for mother and though I am wide awake there should be robbery in my house the song will be but this gives the hint that how we should get liberation friends can refine the sadhana Trishna after the song before we go to this particular song sadhana Tichenor came down and sat by the side of the Narendra and he said the god is beyond the beador's and the injunctions can realize him by studying the Scriptures the beador's and the vedanta then afterwards he turned towards narendra and said do you understand this the beta's if only are indeed he's asking Naren not others very difficult to understand another our emotions and that goes only to make me a scripture may be a an idol maybe some replicas and relics that's all so we the emotion goes and get attachment forget the meaning of it the wing we think the Vedas is holiest of the holy for us like the Quran like the Bible like the true Peter alike people they are thinking that is the holiest thing of course it is really but how far as long as we understand them we read and get the information get the knowledge and get the benefit out of that that is the main thing not the book itself that there is a beautiful sloka he said that the one donkey she was scanning full load of at the very costly sentiment but the poor beast could not get the smell of beauty of the Sun he's only getting it so this is the way we are only carrying so many books full of live reading is that all information only but what about the true knowledge and Saddam additional mention it to not even do you understand things to be this gave only and generate all all the four papers and no petitions so many others because he had a tremendous wonderful intellect he completed all those but at the same time he never forgot the heel of his gurus Ramakrishna all these creatures this is not the whole thing but thing that is explaining through this picture the idea that you are getting you should strive to understand that then the life will change you know that Hindus definite God minded Hindus a broad-minded why because in the bony should itself there's a question they're going on between the two percent one is a householder very famous house ordered another is a very famous rishi I will quote from the Mundaka Upanishad is a third 3rd mantra of the Phoenicians we find the conversation you can see question answer between the Shona God the householder and the Rishi on leadership shown the problem are shallow show another a great household Mahalo means a great householder that means he has completed all his responsibilities as a householder the he has to take the responsibility to maintain the household his family and all that he has completed he has done it and in the society is a well-established man not that out of frustration he is coming atcha can you tell me about God I could not achieve anything in this world so I am coming to God let me try me not not like this he is a completely satisfied person nothing is coming to understand and he is so intelligent he is asking this question for Meera some big person young when we study the Kaneesha began separately maybe we will discuss what is this PT but only we can say homily when you come and say I know but I just like to know from you what is your answer you won't get the proper answer even if you get you won't be able to understand that because your ego is covering the whole thing believer it was a non-profit he asked because we knew Boba Chianti Salim Edom big jonathan babbu didi this is a beautiful question very famous question almost all the moms in there and when they are giving the discourses mostly they will quote this line in that he is asking ooh a triple said what is that which having been known all this become known he's asking to heal once you know only one thing by which he can understand everything so this is a tricky question can you please explain why do all these things things of the questions of the answers are also there but this man is coming though householder but will first will read so he understood that if I have to understand one how did he know the one because he already studying it so he came and asking this question tell me about that one a new English I can understand all others everything so personally no papa bouba Chianti Salva he done began Tom my new English I can understand what others tell me about that in reply on leadership that is she he said there are two types of knowledge one is para and other is opera the Bharani is the high knowledge opera means to our knowledge but the knowledge the widest higher and lower the one thing of knowledge is eternal knowledge will never change but another type of knowledge is all the time changing mathematics changing physics changing chemistry changing medicine changing all different types of things are changing in the olden days where the people is to build the houses is to build by the stones now so many different varieties of things have gone the architects those who are studying architect if they only learn the whole system they won't get the job now so you constantly you have to go on updating your knowledge but once you know the government or the god no change at all no I'm dating of God a child there was only one God he realized in 1960 in 2020 how many girls you have realized not like that it was only one separa and opera what is an opera that knowledge which all his needs the updating because it is changing and what is para we did neighbor changes so he near arts dead and he gave at least friends I like to it draw your attention to sedimentation said this vida there only gives the hint and nothing else and here we find it the Punisher also they say and particularly this our regime of leaders is a famous very famous he is taking on leadership skipping the trick evade you to be the some with a terrible beat shaquiesha Kalpana Chawla Amruta Judy Sharma T all this but the main is first Rig Veda sama Veda sama Veda you read all the four Vedas what at the Opera Vita lure knowledge can imagine why the beta's all the knowledge changing now not that they cannot help you to realize if you even completely memorized all the slokas of the metres the people at their which to memorize the for Veda so they used to get their title as chattel baby but those leaders could not help them to realize the truth this all information so ceramic is not mentioned in that way is a completely different and what is para your action the only dirt by which you imperishable one body government a one can attain you can attain that embraceable one so if we notice that again and again in different scripture in different way they are giving two things one is the atom it is changing and other which is not changing at all so these are the two things and nothing else one is permanent evil permanent imperishable one and another raised all the time temporary changing changing and what is that is changing is culture is called samsara and that which is not changing is god the omnipotent all-pervading Brahman sometimes the truth like this it goes now the song that we were singing the Sudama krishna was singing fire coating mother this is the dream army we Katie Kate gireesham on the Macauley so I really do not understand how mother how is it that you are presented in me and I am also awake I know that you are here even then something has been dropped of me how it is possible you are present I am also had about dad even then there's a very wonderful way the expression that I had the knowledge that I am God I have the knowledge those who are following the path of knowledge they always see so um so um I am that I am that what is that the consciousness the bodies will give me God is within me I am not doing anything God is doing all things are going on and reality God is present within me that's true whether you understand you're not accept it or not God is there how that will come to know from the Shankaracharya the only thing is even then I cannot truly realize so that is the grief through the song is complain is presented to the mother mccauley this is the grief that solely grieves my heart that even with thee o mother and though I am wide awake there should be robbery in my house how is it now if we go to the Shankaracharya we will understand it better the liberation and bondage this robbery means bondage so I know the mother is here the God is here inside me I know that this I am wide awake and even then I am freezing to realize that I am only having the intellectual knowledge meant not the full conviction that is the robbery why who is doing this robbery Maya the illusion a keener Akeem coming and putting the question mark so this is the liberation and the bondage frames once again this is for those who have understood it those who have not understood what is the bondage but then it is nothing the life is just the flow you are born you're growing up you will marry and settle down and you will have the frames and the fools the competition the tension and then one day your date so that is the life flow goes normal so they will say this is natural this is normal if when he was going beyond that and not following immediately the whole society will turn back and look at that who why he is not everybody should go in this in sanskrit it colic got draupadi Karabakh the when all the the ships are going the Rams roms going got dolly copp robber the Pooh one another they do not try to know why we are going they are going alright but why me so this this is the question so who is actually having this then if we know the Hindus we know the penalty nino gaggi varma the individual serve the individual soul the jivatma and wisdom this is the point the jivatma Shyam Bridgette them who built the Buddha the Dharma douchey param Rashad monana sarvatma car son abhi pick Shakti swims such a little Tina will do guitar nibble I'll just try to give you word for word meaning solve our motto it's a skit they do not go in a line by line you have to pick up there to understand the meaning get to pick up the single word from here and there then you can get the meaning service between the second man but we have to start with the with that only why to understand the meaning who is this a logical server art maka that means who is all-pervading this is our birth mother who is that sir god naka admin admin at the Brahman the commercials names is all-pervading sri lanka all-pervading consciousness son of beings and the people do everything sorry Padma come son appeal everywhere Sunmi that exists itself assuming the limitation of the booty itself assuming the limitation of the booty so I am pouring Tschida Oh big deal but in China a boring change up Regina at all pervading breaching our perimeter limited the who became limited the unlimited one how he wanted it is self wanted not your fields eat one take that limitation how to booty but t is what you know that would D means all the gaining drills over which the mine and on which the reflection of the pure consciousness Scotty and put these jivatma this combination all the Phi can increase the st. sergeants then the mind of course is there and booty and reflection of the supreme consciousness on that so but this is the determinative Faculty of the model so that s the booty the best part of the mind you know that we have the four parts booty is the best part and on the handle why because it is reflected the reflection of the supreme consciousness when the reflection of the supreme consciousness is the air so that is the best part and this deflation sometimes in one room all is the solid wall only one place is there right open up there's a glass and in the darkness people will always look to that that particular portion which has a glass and the sunlight is coming to the glass and we can see there and through that light we can see other things inside the room booty's like that but these the small open up where the consciousness reflection of the consciousness light of the consciousness entering otherwise visit our body dark mine we do not find anything just to put thee with understanding you will find some of the people don't grown up but the buting does not match you so it's over there grown Albert you know that a mentally is a so the special is why special case because that would be the determinative faculty the consciousness is not properly manifesting over there we are not utilizing it properly so this boot is very important and because it is getting the deflection from the consciousness I feel or I am that in the whole room suppose all the walls that is blocking the light then they will all go to the booty that particular the open that is that we know the you are our leader can you please see outside complete so he will be legal yes follow me I know what to do and what not to do exactly this thing happened with the Jeeva woman our whole body it cannot do anything so they all go to the booty can you please tell me what we should do now then the Buddha's okay okay wait I will I will take care of it and the booty Saints the eye and the nose and the air and the down and the touch bye daddy collects the information is that we should do this we should not do this he becomes the leader but this movie is nothing but the reflection and whose reflection is this Paramatma and what is this booty / mama who has taken this for Paramatma that is the thing so he hadn't we understand this much then you will go and lie down and say oh I am NOT going to do anything why I should destroy the Mormons not necessary really truly if we understand these nothing necessary you will go like the Raman mercy you will go on like down like this I am NOT going to do anything let the world go in its own way why because I did nothing is the the same person in different dresses and different moods is beginning I have seen it a lot it's not necessary the same person coming in so many different forms and that how it is coming in reality know how illusion you will find sometimes in the moving our days I've observed one person is coming the hero and civility show him in the old scheme the 10 heroes are walking at the time how it is possible a man becoming tame is it a novel I give no is there all division and electronic people that they know how to make it the same way the same supreme soul becoming so many it's becoming Tiger who is becoming the human being the tiger chasing the human being man is running everything is that and if you know that you are completely free from fear as exactly that happened he the life of the young are internal Jonny Vivekananda he was so hungry and he was not getting any food and he lost his way inside the big jungle now when he was sitting under the tree resting he found a hungry tiger approaching him he never tried to climb up the tree or to say what to cry he quietly looked at the tiger and said come because I cannot eat you but you can eat me the same problem you are also on the I am out solving now without food both of us are going to die but you can at least for some days doctor eating me you can survive come eat me but God's grace that didn't happen the tiger went away not finding very tasty food over there so we got Swami ji but look at the courage can you imagine the current welcome discouraged team because of the truth dad and me are not different but that is only ignored but I'm liberated from that ignorance that much I understand that please do not understand so this is what happens suffering shaneandsam but changing with the limitation of the and wrongly identifying itself with this totally unreal entity wrongly identifying itself who is that itself the Drummond wrongly unidentified that means he himself wanted to have like that looks upon itself as something different like our dangers from the claim or that call the children's the movie and one key he went out with a different the trace a value and moving around the city to understand what things are happening other people are not aware so they were and we in the early morning he was written whole night here and there he went he wanted to hear the conversation of the people how the people is living didn't mean he was coming back in the early morning his own gatekeepers who are you and then just going inside stand over here she said you did is not possible I have to go in before it is the daybreak I have to go in but that night well is it then I will just all other people arrested him and put him in the dungeon don't behave like this sit over here look the King now it so happened with us also we have the teams with the Masters and we put on a dress and after that I am NOT allowed to enter into my kingdom it was luckily he was wearing something a ring or something then the minister came he went and the wind he was talking with his hands like this when he said notice the ring oh my god even so he immediately ministered told a moving let the dis gentleman go him he was the king himself luckily the minister noticed the ring and he understood this is our master the same way we have to understand that who is binding us we how misunderstanding what is the misunderstanding I am the pure soul but I have forgotten the identity that this is the whole thing the ceramic is done through a small song he is indicating mother this is a brief the solar eclipse my heart you were there inside me I am also wide away even than the to the master were singing my dear said that to makes me happy the musician that he was singing and slowly slowly we come to the different conversation but maybe in our next discourse we will study here as far as we read the gospel we find almost in every instructions they Dante is present he is only giving the idea of the vedanta-sutra devotion and the here we find that he's also talking about the devotion devotion of the hour shri krishna and the group is that relation gopis knew who is the young shri krishna but they wanted to have the fun to play with him the God has taken the form of a human being Krishna and all the goddesses they have taken the form of the gopis even read the father but they will find the Brahma is instructing all the goddesses and the gods to take the form of the man and woman to go down and prepare the ground for the Lord to come and the Lord came in the form of Shri Krishna and all these gods and goddesses they were nothing but ordinary as we are thinking the very ordinary cowherd boys and girls not like that so these stories from the bhagavata we find one teaching same way if we think with these young people this to come to talk about Salaam Krishna some issues to look at them and see who you have come I was waiting for you Medina regular came he told oh you are here I am also already here as if all the planning's they did somewhere then they came down and when that they are meeting so they are greeting each other of course these people at the beginning couldn't understand so they used to thing why the master is talking like this then slowly slowly it revealed and then they understood they are also not the ordinary being but being humble they wanted to teach us to show us that you must follow the instructions of the Guru the Supreme Being that is there in the scripture and at the same time slowly slowly realized that you are the pure being our the whole religion that gives us this and doing Ellen Burstyn too that they have developed the beautiful stories they have developed the beautiful music the songs the dances and the culture and also the rituals if you go to the juggle not that they are cooking hundreds of dishes varieties and offering to God do you think the God means that every day it is my pleasure because in the previously that the king of that country seems to give the whole money for that and naturally it is to Spain people and then afterwards as a brochure that will come to the market because Ronald my job underneath that joy and bodger means the market the market of joy no distinction even the king will seat the brahmana be not sassy and all walks of people they would sit together and eat why because we are all the same and Babu's Prashad jaren not the master of the universe so this way through the devotional part also the unity in diversity again and again and when one is reaching through the devotion why through the devotion because it is the easiest product quite is easiest because you can equalize the emotion all varieties of emotion you are angry you can go and fight with the car now I am NOT going to talk to you and listen until you are showing me or guiding me you can talk to God in that way in the path of discrimination in the path of knowledge no chance no opportunity of death because with who you are going to fight you were the person so that is why they see that the knowledge of courses are valid and pretty perfect that burner not for all but utter devotion for all why this is for different types of emotions of the air fry we can see all that we can utilize to realize the God the cinema business gospel in every time his giving us the wonderful and excellent knowledge without acknowledge so to eat devotion and that is the beauty of the gospel of the hamish nerve and the gospel of this lumpfish name sir his teachings and the human sometimes on people to misunderstand and they say salaam krishna is not a god and i wonder whom they considered God sometimes I asked him also can increase explain what is right about God majority of ours has a very peculiar idea God means he must be having four hands he must be lifting the heel - someone was standing look at the Krishna he lifted the hill they till nowadays to the modern time a machine can lift the whole hill does it mean the machine is God no not like that that is not the criteria frames you must be knowing the sixteenth chapter of the bhagavad-gita the first three verses that is listed 26 wonderful qualities he dead is manifested in one human form one human being can t call him as God that is exactly we see each and every one of them all those Brist qualities is so difficult to manifest practice that one of the qualities but that man he was having 26 good qualities manifested in his life country calling God the wheels Kurtis and things unnecessarily we are imagining something know that God is those qualities and what why the God has come in the human form to guide us how he can guide us understanding our condition he gives us people present the world this condition he understand and then he says this is the way what is the way through the song he's telling you are called yourself and you have superimposed the ignorance on you just understand these and be free thank you very much let us [Music] [Music] [Music] he shall be thought of but a Misha media [Music] la Krishna she does on the Shawn the chandi Heidi [Music] that said Swedish now venomous too he went back to wound up upon each other I don't understand why a dozen are excluded but within our 20 kill you not a problem in their airports hint hint the knowledge means realization that I had the answer the question you've no birthday Cushman no hog evolved in Chianti salami dumping jeonnam then he goes on telling her having the Opera vida what is Baraka barakatuh and what is Pura Vida and yatta - aromatic a meeting with implement ec2 home etc but its own grandma no indication shaft of Brahma the if you think that that is the sign that we see that is Brahman in Islam and that the last time in the Sunday that will be Wed describing why we say the who because the first sound that created that was the sound like the own car but the Allies ation that the honker of the consciousness in ev'ry being and those beings covered in different names and forms and nothing but the conscious is completely different knowledge so some Charlotte we become the said sentence religion means realization what is religion realization uh nobody and uh no booty that is tidally knowledge of production Oh booty through the help of something it is not sometimes I see a great soul and I feel yes yes it is possible but that also not that ultimate knowledge with that great soul I appreciate but at the same time I myself have not you understand when you read the Upanishads and we go so close to understand so much and so many different doing is they are going on giving us the idea but even they realized at the moment you realize that is the ultimate thing then they say the builders cannot give you that knowledge that's whether this day I came from the one toke oneisha rick jean with you all opera opera he cannot keep you they can guide you that much as i was telling about the map there are maps with a map you have to reach over there when you reach it and then enter you to that particular building mmm now I am here otherwise the map is not to the point that it is there so that is the area of indication they give indication and then once it goes and gets emerged that is the final exactly and that example was given that no one can express actually about the supreme because the moment you anyway explicit immediately becomes fine and it can even refine it is always infinite and the excellent example is that the sword at all this is made of salt and salt comes from the ocean and it goes to measure the depth of the ocean what happens it meant sever theater once again become the ocean itself so when we go and March ourselves and become that infinite beam that is the ultimate and sometimes some great soul the reteam is physical body like the Shankaracharya see Ramakrishna but even then they cannot give you the complete idea body this anandamaya they say this is the supreme they're all this so that's why we de are all not only with any scripture that we only maps they can guide him but otherwise is not going to give you the realization so religion is reorganization thank you
