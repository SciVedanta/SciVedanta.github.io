[310. Panchama Veda 310 - “ How to get rid of lust and gold?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-M8wdufNNM)

namaskar dead devotees and friends uh today this wednesday evening uh we'll be reading the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavan sriram krishna that does begin as usual s [Music] last wednesday when we were reading the the gospel then bhagavan sirama krishna said how to live in this world and he said in his one word live in the world in a spirit of detachment those who have attended the class you must remember that live in this world in a spirit of detachment this is a unique technique the most of the time they think that we have to leave the whole world though it is not possible for all do that in a spirit of detachment that we know when we know this world is purely temporary the why should we put our whole mind and soul into it and get entangled if we have understood at least this much then our spiritual life has began before that it is only the inquisitiveness that's requiring but that much but when we have started our spiritual journey then we have to develop this idea this world is temporary purely temporary it is not there the first they will say it is temporary then the more and more you go into it then the vedanta will say it is not there at all so that is the way we have to understand this world and automatically our mind will be withdrawn from all these things that are happening whatever is coming in that our we have to do something perform something is our duty responsibility we will do but not with an attached mind so that is the difference between a monk and others a monk doesn't mean that he has to have that agarwal clad in the mind only the what it is the detachment this unique teaching bhagavatam is so simple very straight and oh you should do this you should do that 100 times thousand times you should pour water nothing like that live in a spirit of detachment you know that uh last sunday those who are following the yoga vashishta classes they you also know that we are almost completing the yogavashishta the last sunday we were discussing there also the young ramachandra he is asking oh lord his guru family guru bashishta the ram chandra is asking oh lord can one survive without ego because the guru bashista also asked rama to leave without attachment and naturally he said in a very strong word he said kill your mind the mind means the thoughts what are the thoughts desire desire to enjoy desire to listen desire to deal this at that kill the mind it should not be there anything that is attached with this worldly thing should be shunned then the rama is asking is it possible for anyone to live without ego sense if i am not having the ego then who am i how can i survive in reply the guru vashishta he said o rama live in this world inwardly free from all desire and hope but outwardly do what has to be done so that is called jivan mukta avastha and they are doing everything going and visiting the relatives and meeting their friends and living in this world performing all sorts of duties but at the same time inwardly they are completely detached so this is a practice spiritual practice and that is the ultimate thing in this life sometimes some extreme thing that we do and sometimes we don't do anything but when we are practicing this so this way we can live in this world at the same time not attached with anything what is this world these are all the five things that are constantly dragging us rupa rasa sparsha gandha these are the five things and when the people are appreciating you so you are so happy and then they went on going for that and the desires sometimes they will be publishing the who is the richest man in this world so there is a hundred one that reached so much of richness the hundreds and thousands and millions and all this is good they have the capacity to earn they have earned nothing wrong in it but they are attached to that think of the pain the agony the suffering the man will have when dying oh i was having so much of money i'm having so many planes personal plane and these and that what will happen to so he won't be able to leave this body because he is so much attached with this body and so much of but he has to die everybody will die now from this we can understand now earning at the same time whatever the excess money he it is possible for him spreading out giving back to the society for the development of the other people those who could not help themselves okay what is the problem i'm having sufficient i'm having a huge palace for myself why do i need everywhere all the palaces it is not necessary that is called attachment at least that much if we can do if the people can do they will be happy what is the religion religion is nothing but pursuit of happiness all of us are constantly trying to get the happiness and we are thinking that we can get the happiness from the worldly objects and we go and grab the object and we find now it is not like that we see a beautiful flower we run for that pluck it keep it maybe in my pocket and sometimes the ladies keep on the head it's good but after a few hours we have to throw that flower again for another flower it goes on and on and on just like that so sirama krishna as in the modern time the great teacher he is telling that you must live in this world with the spirit of detachment and very ancient time at the time of the sri ramachandra and as the the hindu tradition says this the trita yuga sramachandra also was listening from his guru the guru vashishta the same advice the spirituality means a few practices and the practice physical of course it is necessary the physically but it is mentally and the truth is this this world is transitory as the guru bashista is mentioning o rama this world is essentially unreal and it is of the nature of a juggler's trick when they are showing tricks musicians showing the magic and thousands of people observing that we feel it is true but that is not the one person standing on the stage and moving the hands and saying something mesmerizing thousands of people watching him and he is doing that's so easy and we think all the results all real but it is not then afterwards also we can understand it was not real but that very moment we were carried away with that then that gurus are teaching don't be carried away this world that you see so beautiful now the rich people they're having beautiful curse and previously the rich people were having the best horses horse-drawn carriages only that much now the rich people don't go for the on the horses they go on the very costly curves or they are flying and then that is also very nicely comfortable thing it is there but what is that all temporary this will also change this man will also die somebody else will come it will go like that why i should waste my precious time why precious because after this life i do not know what i am going to do where i am going to go i don't know but this life if by the grace of the god and the good karma my previous birth good karma if i have understood the god is the only reality he is the only source of bliss happiness joy and eternal joy why not try and how we should try very simple as the guru vashishta said to his disciple ramacandra now bhagavan sirama krishna is telling the same thing detach yourself from the worldly objects and he said o rama firmly be established in egolessness the basis to say to his disciple sri ramachandra or rama be firmly established in egolessness and bhagavan sirama krishna said you should eradicate the ego ami mole gucci be janjal the moment that unripe ego the ego which is attached with this particular body and mind and personality and the environment we do not know what is that ego my body constantly changing then how can i say this is me i myself won't be able to recognize my photo when i was an infant lying on the lap of some lady if someone is introducing this is you i said i just believe oh is it it's me i was not knowing and that i when that body has changed and i say this is me then after the death shall i be able to say this body is me no the mind is also changing what is the ego we don't know but all these things are happening because of the is it not very peculiar juggler's trick that's why they said so this is the reason we have to understand who am i i am that eternal spirit and unfortunately i am thinking that i am a body and mind and all these offerings are going on so this is the teaching he said sri ramachandra constantly go on remembering god that is what bhagavan sirama krishna is telling i was filled with great joy if you go on meditating on god what will happen as bhagavan sirama krishna after his experience is telling us i was filled with great joy friends this i am reading from 747 page of the gospel of krishna in english the devotees listen breathlessly to these experiences of the master we have already read that so i'm not reading yes my experiences are for others to refer to but you should live in the world in a spirit of detachment bhagavan sirama krishna is very clearly mentioned he he never wanted need not to do that why he did for the example of the others so that the people will follow him bhagavan sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita also mentioned i don't need anything in this three world i don't need anything i have nothing to do but still i work in the karma yoga the third chapter he mentioned that in this three shoot three three three minutes three in the three worlds swarga martin patala the heaven and this earth and also the neither world i need not to do anything i don't have anything to achieve but still i am constantly working why so that the people will follow me the people will follow me if i am not working the people who say look at the god god never worked so we'll also not do so he is giving the example bhagavan sirama krishna said i practiced all sorts of religion and this is for you so whatever path you think you like follow that the gyana or the vedanta bhakti tantra any path you like you should you can follow he practiced all that then ultimately he's telling then what will happen you will get the eternal joy but how it is possible where is the beginning he said leave in the world in a spirit of detachment then we find he is telling lost and gold alone is the world it makes one forget god the desire he is using the word word lust because it's a terrible desire and no one can overcome it that's very peculiar the nature has given a strong bond but it's for what so if we can understand that then we can understand truly why we are wasting our time in this way he is telling that last and gold alone is the world though everything is happening because of that otherwise they would not have there that's because we have the desire to fulfill the desire we are doing this do you know that we are going to inaugurate the our home of harmony it will be on the 21st of may so we then i thought that why not take out a procession all the attained representative of the trained great religion those who are coming so we'll be walking hand in hand telling people come let us make this world a heaven just that is the message that we'll try to give to the world as because i have the desire so what i should do i have to go to the proper authority the police the local police and then request them and write to them and get the public their permission then only we can do the moment you have a desire you have to work so i am doing it for the betterment of the whole society that is a different thing but even an individual a family man when he wants to do something he has to do all this why desire and if the desire was not there why he who cares for whom i don't care anyone say you'll say no i am not asking anything from anyone i am happy so that desire and the moment you have a desire then you have to full to fulfill that desire you need money for money again you have to work as we are writing applause appealing to the devotees we can you please help us with this this money that money hundreds of them they are coming forward helping us it is my that uh let people know that with all differences apparently differences different paths the people can go hand in hand in the brotherly way without conflicting if we can reduce a little our ego not eradicating forget about that completely removing forget about at least lowering our ego then we can bring peace happiness brotherhood progress in this world we the spiritual people religious people who always talk about god we can do it because god is nothing but love and unselfishness if we truly understood that and god is the all power if we truly understand that why we can can't lower our ego that is the message that i like to give as a monk of the ramakrishna mission because bhagavan srama krishna practiced that that is the ideology that was propagated by his disciple swami vivekananda the continuing that legacy i am trying over here in chicago because everything happened in chicago and it is the responsibility of the chicagoans to continue that excellent legacy of unity in diversity so this is the way we are thinking we are trying here bhagavan srama krishna is very specific lost and gold that is the desire and to fulfill the desire we need the money and look around some young people misguided young people they are so good but still that's because they took a wrong step and become addicted to something and they need money they take up arms they're looting people then one day getting the punishment and then whole life is lost the beautiful human life lost just because of one desire so this is the way if we can understand we will naturally rectify ourselves we'll try to help others also so he said lost and gold alone is the world karma only is this world desire is the world what is this world nothing but desire it makes one forget god and what is god it is love and unselfishness and when one become completely under the control of the lost and to fulfill that that terrible desire he wants to get some money in the wealth he forgets god why he is doing it to get happiness why the man is running after money to get the happiness not misery not suffering not punishment but happiness if that that is so where is the happiness the source of happiness god look at it the god is in the east and we are running towards the west exactly opposite so that is the thing we must have to understand if the god is the source of happiness then why should i have to go to that dark path to earn some money only to fulfill my desire which can never give me permanent happiness so this when it goes into head then it begins the spiritual life our journey begins from there the girish is asking but how can we get rid of lost and gold then bhagavan sirama krishna is telling it is the pray to god with a yearning heart as because bhagavan sirama krishna is giving the teaching over here of devotion narada the bhakti the devotion along with the knowledge why we should love god because god is the source of joy happiness peace eternal and we want that this is the first thing secondly this world and what all these things of the world the form the name the smell the taste all the five things that of the world cannot satisfy me cannot give me eternal happiness this is the gyana this is the knowledge this is the way we think and we understand yes this is the truth now we should go to god how that is the question the girish the great greece has asked and said pray to god pray to god with a yearning heart pray to him for discrimination oh god give me that intellect that mental power so that we can i can understand what is temporary and what is permanent the god has created this world so naturally god has created in such a way he's the best creator so obviously his creation is as if everything is so perfect he is building us now who can take us out god himself otherwise it is impossible so that is why sadama krishna is saying pray to god because he is the creator and if you are praying to him so obviously he will think okay for him let me show the truth then he will say come to this side see look at this this our world is like this you need not to bother about it so god only can help us who is the guru the manifestation of the god guru the spiritual guide is nothing but the manifestation of with god only god can help in that particular human form a little power of god is manifesting and that manifestation is guiding us so all the guru that we see all around us in this present-day world so that is the way we have to understand pray to god with a yearning heart pray to him for discrimination the power of discrimination power of understanding what is temporary and what is permanent what is truth and what is untruth what is the cause of suffering and what is the cause of joy happiness that capacity most of the people are not having they always think in the other way and they're boastfully egoistically we have understood it we read the science we know everything the people arguing that way then the ultimately when they suffer they are confused they do not know what to do and what not to do at the end of their life if you go and see you will find so much of suffering rich person very charismatic character person very popular all many many are there why because of this they could not understand the what to discriminate the discriminative faculty discriminative power understanding clarity that also should come from god otherwise it is impossible god alone is real and all else illusory illusory temporary and just mittal this is discrimination one clear water goes through a sieve leaving the dirt behind apply the seed of discrimination to the world live in the world after knowing god then it will be the world of biddya the two words mostly the vedantin and the hindus they apply what is biddya god alone is true and what is avidya exactly opposite in the yoga sastra of course they talk about the pancha glacier panchaklish means the hurdle to realize god the five hurdles what are those glacier i mean suffering literally glacier means suffering but these are hurdles there's a thing that we have to overcome and that they are five puncher the first is abidya avida means ignorance and what is this ignorance accepting this world as true though we are experiencing every day that things are changing when i saw a little baby just born and after 10 years as a grown-up boy jumping running here and there then after 20 years as a youth then after 40 years like that all everything is changing all around me even then i think this is permanent that is called a vidya and this is truly truly the excellent magic of god when we look at our body when you see a few hours before i was so strong my muscles were strong and i could eat i could run i could talk i could do these and that now slowly slowly the strength is going away suddenly in the morning i get up and it is so difficult to walk knee pain back pain this is that still we think oh this happened this is but world is permanent this is the magic of god we are experiencing seeing understanding hearing but still don't like to believe that is called abidya ah vidya all means negative bitter means knowledge just it is not knowledge then it is ignorance the first is the ignorance and why we can't understand why can accept it when the all the scriptures are telling the same thing all the gurus are telling the same thing again and again they're experienced people they have realized the truth they are realize the god and they are saying that these seas all temporary don't stick to these whatever comes before you just practice that and try to be permanently happy how by we drawing the mind live in this world but in a detailed mode the so many times it has been taught but why we can't do that asmita i understood i know i have a certificate i have graduated from this famous university i know and then ultimately when the day come then i rule look around me and i see that i am so lonely no one is there and i am so helpless i have money in the bank i have friends all around but still no one can help me nothing can help me i am so helpless why this asmita so fast is the five pancha the first one is the ignorance of it second is asmita and what is the cause of suffering why i can't take out my mind from all this thing raga raga the sanskrit word say attachment the raga again in sometimes the indian will understand it as the anger but in sanskrit it is krodha anger is krodha but when they in sanskrit they say raga raga means attachment a liking is all right but the when that liking becomes permanent it is attachment and we start feeling that i cannot survive without that that is called raga liking is all right when you go and see the blue sky i like it when i go outside the green now the slowly the green is coming back particularly in this country in chicago and other countries places where it is so cold now slowly those trees are becoming this is very unique thing again those trees they were surviving the terrible cold all of them were covered with the white snow now the snow has melted the air has calm now again the birds are coming the flowers are blooming this circle goes on and on so this is the way we try to understand but if we think oh i have to go and sit under that tree without that i cannot survive i must see that blue sky from my window otherwise i cannot survive i must go to that particular shop and to purchase this otherwise i cannot survive so that is called raga that is attachment you can get that from somewhere else but no i want that only without that i am not going to survive so that is called raga attachment liking that is that it's separate but this is different very different raga means a type of mentality and they grow they develop and it becomes a part of the self now i must get that i must live with that otherwise i am going to die that is called raga and then exactly opposite to raga called means abortion this is also attachment the moment you are thinking against someone you are attached to that person or the thing the dwisha aversion is constantly going on meditating on that particular thing which i don't like i like i go on thinking brooding over that i dislike i go on thinking brooding over that then what actually i am doing disturbing my mind the mind is the only instrument through which i can go to god but that mind i am polluting by misusing it i am constantly thinking this world is permanent and accordingly i am behaving this is the main problem and then i am doing it i i am not ready to listen to anyone because of my ego oh what the swamis will say ah they don't know anything how many certificates they are having how many qualities they are having i am having these that so this ego that they have closed their doors and windows of their mind they don't like to listen they are not open even to understand that things are changing this is the first is the avidya then it is asmita then raga dwesha and ultimately abhinivesha here the avinivasa means fear of death why attachment i have got so much attest to this body i don't like to live a old dilapidated body can't move can't do anything still i'm so much attached to this body now it is becoming filthy i cannot clean properly even then i like to survive somehow or other now 120 years still i like to survive if someone says if you drink milk the 1k the milk cab every day one glass of milk i will practice that if they they do like this do like i will try to do that under 20. even then so the people don't like to die and they're so much afraid to die of course it is not that we should go and commit suicide oh there's nothing like that but it is attachment what we are discussing it's a matter of attachment when you get too much of attachment to this body then we are afraid of death it is that is a change the aversion and then attachment and then the ego and these are the pancha clashes the five different types of bondages the bhagavan srama krishna mentioned the first one biddya then abhidya automatically then he is telling that then it will be the world of bitter live in the world after knowing god what is god god is permanent god is eternal god is the creator and god is the real per thing which is doing everything so when you understand that then all around whatever is happening cannot touch us because we know it is actually not it is not reality and that reality goes so far that we understand that this death is also a change if i have desire in this life again i will born and to fulfill those desire again i have to come back and he is telling all are deluded by lost and gold but i do not care for it at all then he is talking about himself giving the example i do not care about it at all and i swear to you that i do not know anything but god i swear i do not know anything but god now the question is what is this god god means an image that we are having the millions of images of gods and goddesses then almost all the traditions in the world they are having different types of gods and goddesses and their forms their names their symbols their signs is it that no i may like these i may like that it doesn't matter to confront the concentration the god means consciousness the god means all pervading consciousness and that pure consciousness is sometime manifesting with through one source and that is love and unselfishness so when i understand that the pure consciousness all pervading consciousness is there so obviously this is the way we can understand the coming saturday a group of devotees from southern california they have invited me to give a talk about this only the non-duality in sirama krishna the srama krishna is the worshiper of kali and sometimes krishna and rama and all these everything he has worship at the same time he's the embodiment of the vedanta this is a nice subject that we'll be dealing with on saturday morning so this uh of course on zoom will be the youtube will be talking so all are deluded by lost and gold but i do not care for it at all and i swear to you that i do not know anything about god then what devotee is telling sir a new sect named has been started and lolita chatterjee is one of the members let me check it this is new he is one of them different names the people they give different names and they start one religious thing they think it is so easy it is not sometimes some people the thing that we will put on the gerua and then we will claim ourselves a holy man and all people will come to me no it is not so easy you have to develop the divine qualities again friends if you are interested i will you can read in the uddhava gita there when the uddhava is asking who is a sadhu because the lord krishna told you better go and have the holy company be in the holy company then the uddhava his friend and disciple requested to tell him how to identify a person as a real holy person then the lord is giving a long list of 20 different qualities and that one should develop to become a holy person cheating others etc that is a different thing but if the sincerity is there to become holy then those 20 qualities one should imbibe otherwise it is impossible then the bhagavad-gita krishna is telling there are different views all these views are but so many paths to reach to the same goal this is sirama krishna and that's why we are trying to give people an idea about this and this he said all these views are but so many paths to reach the same goal somebody is calling as a god jehovah allah ishwar all different names only but it's the same goal and when one reaches over there what he sees forehand ten hands and lights are coming out that god no this is the embodiment of joy the pleas eternal and pouring out as a love and unselfishness the moment one realizes god and it mind become full with love love for each and everything no narrow love love for only my family and my surroundings no love for each and every one and that is possible when one become unselfish that is the ultimate god realization and studies ramakrishna is telling all are leading to the same goal go and ask any religion is your god a selfish one is your god a cruel one no one will say that no no no no no our god is full of love he's so merciful he's powerful and he's full of mercy kripa kripa kripa in india they will say the god has grace grace and grace then if that is so all are leading to the same goal only they are taking different paths the problem is they think that is the only path o n l y that word is creating all problem and our effort should be to make people understand your path of course it is good if you are following sincerely but at the same time others paths are also good in the same way you have not realized god you have not seen god you have not talked to god then how can you say the god won't give the blessings to that person who is going to him through another part are you dictating god what he will do and not so this understanding will really really remove everything only we have to lower our ego bhagavan sudama krishna why we always talk about him because he is the embodiment of the parliament of religions he has practiced and then said all paths are leading to the same goal but everyone believes that his view alone is right that is his watch alone keeps correct time and it's going on telling like this then the girish he is commenting do you remember now greece is committing to aim do you remember what pope says about it at that time who was the post he mentioned something and the master mashay quoting this with our judgment as our watches none go just alike yet each believes his own that was that time the pope said that bhagavan suramar krishna asked them what does it mean the master masha said everyone thinks that his own watch keeps the correct time but different watches do not give the same bhagavan srama krishna again see how he's answering this but however wrong the watches may be the son never makes a mistake the sun will rise to the east and the right time it'll never give any mistake one should check one's watch with the sun when we are going for a person we are making the mistake so that is the problem as a philosophy is the best path but the moment we go for a narrow a single individual and thinking that is the ultimate we enter into a very difficult narrow path which may take us to the destruction so one should be very very careful only this person whatever he says that is true and all others are not that is really a very dangerous path very narrow path that is the reason one should be careful particularly in the philosophical path sometimes we like someone and we start generating he is the only thing only person whatever he says is correct all others oh they don't they can't explain they don't know he's the only one he's the only one is the cult that we create it was a dangerous thing zidane krishna never liked it those who are for the followers of a cult we only believe in him and no one else it's a cult but philosophy is completely different you judge yeah something he is telling is okay the same thing has been sounded it has been spoken already in different places that is also true what i like to take this is my capacity i will accept this thing and i will try to develop those qualities that's all what is spiritual life but people go mad with someone and then follow and try then ultimately ruin their spiritual life by that way because any narrow path will take you to destruction a neighbor success because the spiritual path slowly slowly widen and widen and widen and it becomes like a sky this we have to understand it is not taking us in a narrow dark path no no no it is only taking us to the whiter wider and wider bhagava swami vivekananda say to one of his direct disciples i don't know whether i have realized god or not in a way of the way he expressed this is the way of humble way to expression oh i have realized god and i swear i realize god we indian never will say that like that if they say we will understand he's a egoistic person he doesn't know anything but he will say in a humble way but indication is very clear oh brother i do not know whether i have realized god or not but my mind has become so broad that if there is truly is devil i think i can be with him too i can adjust with him the devilish person even then my love has become so much i can adjust with him too this is god realization god realization doesn't mean the hallow going round at the back of the head or the sun this power of that power that is also a very small thing the man full of love a broadness embracing everyone understanding and he's crying for everyone praying for everyone he is a god realized person the bhagavatam krishna is telling the but however wrong the watches may be the son never make a mistake one should check one to watch with the sun then he says truthfulness in speech is the tapasya of the kali yuga in bengali he said truthfulness in the speech exactly what has happened what i have watched that i am telling but just to where and the win uh in a in a the election go on telling lies lies lies and lies then after winning what i am going to do only for four or five years and i'll be in the power what i'm going to do a little bit of taking the decisions whether the road should be constructed whether this the this bridge will be there or not these decision i am taking only what else i am not the supreme king this is only a few little decision i can take and some people will be working and for that so much falsehood why so these we have to ask questions those who like to do let them do but if we are sensitive to follow the path of spirituality truthfulness and those those who tell lies avoid them because asatya the asata means that untruthful they're telling the lies they are deluding the people committing all sins if we are in association with those people their result will also come in our mind so that's why one should be very very careful those who are telling the lies only to satisfy their selfish uh their goal we have to avoid them we have to be careful so in the beginning bhagavan sunam krishna taught us pray to god for the power of discrimination how i will understand these people are telling the lies that capacity will grow we will understand that they are not telling the truth truthfulness in speech is the tapasya of the kali yuga it is difficult to practice other austerities in this cycle by adhering to truth one attains god and tulsi tulsida said truthfulness obedience to god and the regarding the other's wives as one's own mother are the greatest virtues if one does not realize god by practicing them then tulsi is a liar friends many of you know the tulsidas they said gosvami tulsidas he was a great devotee of sri ramachandra and he used to see sri ramachandra and in the company of sri ramachandra he used to leave and move and all he wrote because he saw that in his realization and he wrote a biography of sri ramachandra the means the character the ramachandra his character and manaser the biography of sri rama that i felt in my mind so ramcharitmanas there the tulsidasi is a highly respected person he is mentioning if you are following this three discipline you'll surely realize god if you don't tell me a liar if you say some respectful people a liar that is like giving him the death punishment the death penalty so that is telling satyavachan truthfulness as a humbleness to god parastri maatri saman and the wives of others considering as mother that means restraining the saints says he if you are practicing these three and if you don't realize god tulasi jhu to jaban jaban means the tongue in hindi jaban is tong that means it is the word that he is telling i am a liar call me a liar if you are practicing these three sincerely and have not realized god this is a challenge those who say that there is no god why don't you practice these three sincerely so that is the way we can realize god bhagavan sirama krishna quoting the gosvami tulsidasi he said these are the main thing practices and first and foremost is truthfulness i think friends we should stop over here and then we'll continue our study you know again in the next wednesday so let us listen the questions well hansaraj has harsha raj has two part questions i will read the first one part one it is said that the brahmagani never makes an error and even what seems to be a false step for others it is art for him but does a gyani's actions have some boundaries or none see brahma gyani what is that brahman all-pervading consciousness when he is constantly aware of it the why he will make any mistake he cannot but that is the thing suppose i know as a grown up person as a live wear electrical wear as a dangerous it can give another kill me i will never touch it wherever it is in whatever form i will never touch it isn't knowingly the same way the brahmagani knowing this world purely temporary will never ever accept it or enjoy it or try to get it as a permanent one you'll never do that that is the thing so brahma ghani never takes any false steps and i said that's part two can girish kosh remain like he was before meeting thakur and still realize brahman and can brahmagani be and act like how girish was before meeting see you need a guru girish chandra ghosh though he was apparently a drunkard and all that but he was a very well learned person and he had a great faith and hankering to be good the first thing is that if you don't have the hankering to be good then you can never become good so that's girish was having that then he made bhagavan sirama krishna his guru and he guided him that you should do like this he followed that and he realized god and he became happy in his own life a brahman gyani having the brahma-gyana if he is behaving like the girish chandra that means he is just making a drama oh i am just drunkard i am doing this i am doing that but the brahmakani can never be able to do that because those things he never liked he left all those things after the spitting who will go and lick that can anyone do that so this question is a completely wrong question i should say the brahma ghani has spat out all this worldly name fame and all those things even by mistake they will never do that they will never take that thank you the devashish is asking can you please explain the difference between shakar and nirakar oh there were shish you know the bhagavatam krishna himself got a beautiful example and that what is shakara is having form and what is nirakara without form now giving the example of the water assorama krishna say water you know the hindus they use the water as a symbol of nirakara without form because if you are keeping the water in a the tumbler in a glass and whatever container it it takes the form of that it itself is not having any uh any form so hindus they use that as a symbol of nirakara now srama krishna utilizing that he is telling have you not seen that with the the cool breeze that water is taking the form of an ice water which is nirakara without form because of the devotion of a devotee taking a form similarly a god who is completely all-pervading consciousness when a devotee is praying lord i like to see you in this form i love you in this form please reveal thyself in this form then he takes that form so that is why they always said in the scripture that because of the devotees is a kalpana as an imagination he takes that form and come and give the darshan bhaktanam because of the devotees the very sincere lover of god onukampartham to bless them to grace them brahmana all pervading consciousness rupa kalpana he takes the kalpana it means imaginary rupa and the other way that means through devotion the formless is becoming form again suramar krishna said in the sun scorching sun the power of sun that form which was the eyes melt and become water again that means when a person is constantly thinking how there can be a form because it is all pervading consciousness and he is discriminating judging analyzing through him for him that form become without form this is the way we have to understand thank you let us conclude by saying shanti three times and offering to srama krishna o vishanthi shanti shantihi [Music] foreign you
