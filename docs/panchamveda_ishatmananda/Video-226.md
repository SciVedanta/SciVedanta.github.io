[227: Panchama Veda 227 : Devotion Of Mahavir Hanuman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwkLpZzBV7U)

means devotees good evening today we will study the Pancham of Vita the gospel of sri ramakrishna that is begging as usual Tabaka Tom rhythm dr. G Bonham kabhi be rewritten Cal mashup 'him 7 among golem srimad Artem boo big unum ta Murray dodging aha today we shall read from the the account that the master Masha has given it was Sunday October 5th 1884 English gospel the page 590 and here we find Saddam o Krishna he was sitting in his room after the midday meal with m-master Masha Hazra the elder Kali elder Kali another Kali was there to differentiate then Bob Arum Ramlal hurry and others some of them sat on the floor and some stood about on the previous day the master had visited tea shops mother at a Calcutta house and had made her happy with his devotional songs Hazra had been leaving with the master adoption assured a long time he was a little conceited about his knowledge proud about his knowledge and even criticized the master now and then before others again he would sit on the veranda of the Masters room and tell his beads with apparent concentration so this is a character the God in the form of a bonsai ramakrishna the perfect he is inside the room just outside there is another person is hypocrite we can say the hypocrisy he's showing that he is concentrating but he is not he is counting the beads but he's not that way devoted so that is the two different picture we find from here the one should be very careful that those who were little Hippocratic their behavior a very attractive the majority of the people those who understand understand the what is reality what is truth they are attracted to those people were showing up so here we find that to picture the master Mercia graphically given that his one is inside see Ramakrishna no show up but the God himself and another person just very close to him he is completely different now Sri Ramakrishna the Masters room until his big sample he spoke slightly object he spoke slightingly of Chaitanya as a modern incarnation he would say God gives not only pure devotion but also wealth he has no lack of it by attaining God one obtains the eight occult powers as well now why he's talking about these the master m√¢che the next line he is mentioning Hazra had a small depth to clear up about 1000 rupees or so is not much in how it is but in those days 1000 was a big amount he had incurred it for the building of his house and was worried about paying it the elder Kali as a position in an office from which he received a small salary he had a large family to maintain in those days the joint family in Asian countries in the Asian families they were like that still some of the families are joint family but because of the socio and economical condition the families are broken so this joint family so only one earning member so he had a large family to maintain she was devoted to the master and visited him now and then even absent in himself from the office Kali to ozra you go about criticizing people you are like like a touch tone testing what is pure goal and what is impure why do you speak so much II love others even the devotee the Kali is talking to the Hara and he finding out trying to rectify him Hara whatever I say I say to him meaning Sri Ramakrishna alone the dear here we find I am talking to Sri Ramakrishna and I have every right to tell him but this is the God is the all-compassionate and good it's the people those who are having the bad tendencies did you go to God and sometimes they'll be criticizing God the God is compassionate so hostile mentioning that I don't go telling about here and there I go to him master that is so he is happy that huzzah criticizing him and he is not telling others so master is admitting that is so hasta began to explain Tata Jana has received the meaning of dr. Jana is the knowledge of the existence of the 24th Tatas cosmic principles rochonc of philosophy they talk about 24 totters he was wrong about the meaning of the world a devotee what are they has de five elements six passions five organs of perception five organs of action and so forth master smiling listen to him see Ramakrishna most of you know and those studying the biography of cinema Krishna that way he was not educated he went to only the primary school in the inner in the villages this called part Sala this to go and attain that the primary education that much after that he didn't study but through his spiritual knowledge he knew everything so perfectly even the the scriptures the wind the hostel was mentioning this he was wrong of course when he was explaining the twenty-four Tata Tata Jana master smiling listen to him notice how he explained that Ayana the word really mean knowledge of self Tata Tata means the knowledge I taught two amines this self taught wha Gianna Gianna is the knowledge the Tata what is the talk to the Brahman the cell the Hartman there is the truth which he never changes that is called tattwa and then guiana means the knowledge the knowledge of self the word thought means the supreme self and the word warm the embodied soul one attains supreme knowledge that ghana by realizing the identity of the embodied soul and the supreme self after a few minutes has relieved the room and sat on the porch master to aim and others he meaning Ezra only argues this moment perhaps he understand but the next moment he is old self again when the angular hook a big fish and find it pulling hard he releases the line otherwise it will snap the snap and the angler himself will be thrown into the water therefore I do not say much to him so that means slowly slowly he is transforming his mind this moment if he tried to do so this is the way of a teacher we have to understand the person because of his big ego tremendous ego he is not at all ready to accept we have to wait the tremendous patience this religious teachers true religious teachers and having tremendous patience the master was telling about it to him Hazra said that a man could not be liberated unless he was born in a Brahmin body how is that I said one attains liberation through bhakti alone this is the wonderful sentence the bhakti the devotion one attains liberation through bhakti this bhakti means the devotion and this devotion presupposes conviction of the existence of God unless and until it is there the devotion will never come devotion means one pointed or concentrated a complete sacrifice of the mind body and thought to the ideology that is devotional how it is possible the very first thing is the conviction that the God is there unless and until we understand that the devotion will never come of course that word devotion is utilized for many different way so he is devoted to his children or to his work or his duties there is a different thing but the wind we use the word devotion means bhakti this bhakti is a binding the whom I am binding my god so this is a unique conception and one part that leads to God is knowledge another part that is bhakti these two are great the we can say the the highways to God the speedway's to God so this way we can say the bhakti bhakti means devotion and devotion we all that our emotions are there that we utilize to realize God when the knowledge is there is a a group of people a type of people for them they are constantly thinking it is really very difficult even in the bhagavad-gita it says but it is a path as a valid path and very wonderful path but the bhakti the devotion why we think about the bhakti because it is so normal natural within us now bhakti means love we have the love and we always think about our own people our Keith and King our children and our parents our respected the teachers and others so that devotion is there but when that devotion goes towards the God is very difficult why we can't talk to God we can see God with others it is easily available but with God just a conception so DC is the first type of devotion is so difficult and then you have to have the qualities to understand the existence of God even if the God comes before you see I am God do you think we are ready to accept that we won't be able to understand so this we have to understand friends this devotion we see in the life of Mojave illumine the today is the Bobby giant II and this Hanuman geez life is a living example of bhakti-yoga so we may discuss a little about this Bobby Hanuman Hanuman Swami Vivekananda he liked that ideology of the Hanuman he was having all great qualities he was as they call it or to Lita Bala domum name in his the sloka that explained or tool eatable Adama sureness real our body him dhannu japonica shanem eonni nam acronym Sokka Laguna need hanim Bonner annum adhesion Raghupati Bora do tomahto Yatim namami now here Auto Lita Balarama he was having the tremendous power the leader of the monkey is the messenger of the Rama and his strength was matchless physical intellectual and spiritual this three strength was there in the new mana but he was so humble so devoted and so dedicated a person who is not having any quality and then coming and serving there is a different thing a person having everything he's so powerful and then not only that Gani naam Aragon iam he was very advanced among the almost first among the knowledgeable people Gianni NAR Meganium he was a great nor a Brahmin and at the same time he became sekolah guloona Dhanam he was having all great qualities within him that we found that about the it says the Hanuman was having the loyalty courage strength intelligence discriminative faculty board frank resourceful quick and tactful those who have read the biography of the hanumana in order of ramayana you know how he was handling all the situation and he was having tremendous spiritual power the yogic power when they came to know that Ravana has abducted the Sita and has taken heart to Sri Lanka where and for to reach the sea Lanka they have to cross the ocean then who will go how it is possible then one person came and told Hanuman oh no mana you can do it because you have that power the spiritual power then Hanuman ax remembered his full strength the yogic capacity and that ordinary the form became huge in the front of everyone then he jumped and caused that ocean this is sometimes some people will believe sometime not but for a yogi it is possible it is possible the hana hana having was that capacity then on the way he had to face so many problems he solved himself immediately quickly then he reached to that place the city and he was going on searching Sri Sheeta and when he were searching the Sheeta fast he went to Robin s palace and he saw well-dressed ladies immediately he discriminated no it is not possible leaving Sri Ramachandra Sita cannot dress like this she must be a suffering personality now I must find out her somewhere else not in the palace so inside the palace he saw he starts schita and then he understood schita cannot be here when she has lost three damage and she must be on all the time meditating on sri ramachandra and practicing austerity see that this is called discrimination then he started searching in other places and when he found schita schita will never look at any other the male body the Hanuman understood that then what he did first he dropped the ring that the Rama Chandra gave him to show it to Sita it dropped the ring from the top of the tree to attract the attention of the Sita a cheetah plucked that and then she was wondering how come she knew that that was the ring of Sri Ramachandra she was wandering looking here and there then he appeared why the first appearance at leaf he goes and say now I am Hanuman earth I am carrying the message of ram chandra schita we don't believe in him so obviously this shows that how intelligent he was when you had to perform a work you must also have the intellect to understand how I should perform this work so the yogah karmasu kaushalam they say yoga what is the yogah karmasu kaushalam the action that you were doing in a perfect way and you become successful that is called yoga yoga that union that is your mind and mind should be always trained to this hanumana was so perfect in this and he approached to the mother Sita then explained everything then he thought I should give a hint - this Ravana and his followers how powerful sri ramachandra 'yes they're challenging Sudama chandra will let me show only one follower of sri ramachandra can do the havoc so he started burning the whole city they the he went and made three wrong ravana and had a dialogue tried to convince him all those things were over not that immediately started burning No so this he gave the opportunity to take their proper decision they could not take the Robin I made the mistake what I am we can see in the characteristics of the Hanuman ax he was doing everything perfectly and he was arrested he actually went and surrendered then they took him to the Ravana where and then he had a dialogue with the Ravana he tried to convince Ravana that it will be a great problem for the whole civilization of the rakshasas if they are challenging Sri Ramachandra and then afterwards he thought I must give them a show so they can understand the how powerful three Rama Chandra if one soldier of Rama can be so powerful so obviously they'll be afraid to break their confidence he started burning the whole the Sri Lanka the Lanka that dahana that we know he burned the Lanka all alone that shows his great power his confidence and at the same time his intellect he wanted to make his Lord Sri Rama the great but how he did it this is one the friends will be will be wondering that the first meeting that he find in the Valmiki Ramayana this Rama Chandra and Ramana there is a God and his devotee and this we find over here the Hana mana unawareness father was stationed let me give a gesture I found in the Ramayana her numinous father was scary and that's why he is also known as phenomena is known as Keisha Dean and honor and a sharee was the king of Sumeria and his father was the great British booty the teacher the Guru of the Gods so that was his lineage Hana Mona's mother was on Jana and she worshipped Shiva for long 12 years to have Sheba as a son there is always the Swami Vivekananda's mother she also works it for many many years almost 1012 years to the Shiva to get Shiva as our Sun so this Anjana also did the same thing it is said that the great king dasharatha of the king of ayuda perform put trachoma yoga to get the son the progeny wished to perform the eungeum the power of mantra ET is there sometimes we think it is not but it is this is the power of mantra then when you talk properly winning author properly the effect is there any way they perform the Putra kama yoga with the help of the famous Rishi's at the end he received the divine pari pudding from the gods the king dasharatha distributed that pudding among his three queens accidentally a drop of that pudding slipped from the hang of of his second wife clicking and the bar swiftly picked it up and then flew Indra the king of gods noticed it then he asked the pavana the god of the air to protect that divine pudding and delivered that to lady and Jana like shridhama and his three brothers hana mana also was born with the divine blessings as Poblana delivered that divine pudding to lady and Jana her son became also known as pub una puta the Hanuman is known as engineer the because the mother's name was Anjana - engineer then the Kayseri nun Donna his father was Cassidy and also pavana Putra we find that at the end of the Ramayana to offer the salutation to all the devotees they always say ohm Sri Sri Sheetal lakshmana bharatha shatrugna who knew not samhita Sri Ramachandra parabrahman e namaha now we know that they are the family Sita is the power of Sri Ramachandra and lakshmana bharatha through bina also the brothers in the same family in the same lineage we can understand the sita lakshmana bharatha Shatrughna how come Hanuman Hanuman ax doesn't belong to that family but why his name is coming the same line y devotees are uttering his name with the same breathe because the whole umana also was born out of that pudding and so obviously they became the frames and the brothers in Valmiki Ramon we find Sri Rama and the humans first meeting in the jungle of rich Samak mountain horn Ivana was dressed like a brahmana came on behalf of the shagreen to understand who were these two brothers now there's a long story though Rama in a story I'm not going to enter into that that the souq River was hiding in that particular regime Oak Hill and he was hiding because he was afraid of his elder brother so that is the reason he was there and his friend and minister was only one wonder they noticed the two human being that is our Ram Chandra and Lakshmana they are coming through the jungle from the top of the mountain denote estate and they were afraid so who were these people and they were so powerful and their arms were powerful so the shoe grip wanted to get the idea about this two person so he sent Hanuman Hanuman ax came in dressed like a brahmana why because in those days even today if you are wearing amongst race or a brahmana then usually people will believe you and they will never hurt you whatever happens that is the tradition wonderful tradition of India those who are dedicated to God and constantly trying to help others with love and devotion we were maybe even the dacoits even the stalks even the very low minded people usually do not disturb the monks and the brahmanas the hanuman a-- came in the form of a brahmana dressed like a brahmana so obviously there is a symbol that you can believe me so Hanuman I approached and he had a long talk with Rama and Lakshmana when he left Lakshmana expresses doubt about he said who is this person and now we should read from the Valmiki Ramayana at the translation in English Rama's observation see this is the observation who Lakshmana non can speak does without mastering the Vedas with their branches vada we Don gher now those who have studied the Veda they can quote from the Veda and they understand what actually they are meaning what they're quoting unless and until you have studied that you cannot they will quote from the bhagavad-gita or the bhagavata or other books like that dopes anisha's like this Veda means Upanishad so when you were quoting obviously you are master in that and as a brahmana as a righteous person as a religious person you are supposed to know you scripture he was supposed to quote from dear when you are having the dialogue so this is what the hanuman are did and Ramachandra observed now when the rah-rah Lakshmana was doubting to remove that doubt from the mind of the Lakshmana he said non can speak thus without mastering the Vedas with their branches nor is there any defect in his countenance that this sentence we must carefully read and afterwards we will discuss there's a wrong conception about the hanuman a-- read it in there very carefully in the bal mickey ramayana the original rama and after that so many varieties of ramayana all over the India almost in every state language the different languages Rahman is there even in Bengal it is there but the original Sanskrit and Valmiki Rahman it says see that no any defect in his countenance eyes forehead brows or any of his limbs you know those who are the the practicing martial arts or they're at they have their military class you can understand seeing their figure they must be very muscular and some of the cards here and the air on the face is eyes are very penetrating type and and many many features are there the obviously ceramic and observed that though he came in the form of a brahmana and well-built person but at the same time not only his pronunciation and the knowledge of the Veda but his countenance his eyes his forehead it brows and any of his limbs they were not having any defect that means he is completely dedicated to sattva-guna his accents are wonderful auspicious and captivating accents are wonderful when a person is speaking or quoting the scripture it must be very clear and that proves that he knows the subject he knows what is speaking and a species exactly where you are supposed to quote and what that is that and captivating the way he is prove that way he is expressing that very captivating these are the good qualities of a script the person Rama accepted Hanuman as his friend and follower and Hanuman felt himself drawn irresistibly to the divinity of three so this is a devotee who goes to his chosen Idol immediately feels that the drawn isn't as if he is drawn to that you know the among the Hindus death so many gods and goddesses are there some are very very close to Shiva Lord Shiva some are to the goddess Kali Durga asou Ramachandra or Krishna or Ganesha and we the followers of Sri Ramakrishna whenever we see the picture of Sri Ramakrishna the quotation of Saddam apprecia we always feel attracted to that why because that thought we it shoots me the cinema Krishna's thought we all are giving the spiritual teaching all our leading us are helping us to grow spirituality but the way they are conveying it that wavelength that reaches and I find oh this is perfect for me I will never be happy if I go to some something else here let me tell that though it is not in there and the subject that we are studying now but it is sometimes when ceramic is not said all paths are leading to the same goal Giotto moth tato path what does it mean do I have to change the Hinduism to Islam or Christianity or Buddhism no that means I have accepted see Rama Krishna at my idol and he's thoughts he's whip lengths and that is matching with me I like that path but it doesn't mean that I have to denounce or criticize others that is it when Saddam Oh Krishna says all paths are leading to the same goal one gentleman I was telling why not then convert yourself into Christianity let the whole world become Christian then there'll be one God and one relief I don't know it is not possible as the five fingers will be different but at the same time the hand is helping the same way though the paths are different gods names a different process or difference practices a different but all religion is helping to grow to divinity that humanity should become divine with the help of the religion though in name outwardly different so this is Ramachandra the moment he appeared before the hanumana immediately on Awana failed oh this is my god - why not others who knew mana only practiced all those qualities that see Rama Chandra was practicing the win who knew mana was talking with the Rama Ravana he expressed all those now this is oh no mana as Sri Ramachandra saw that he is perfect in his figure how it is when he look at the picture of anumana we see there is a different completely different picture why we can't have the picture of a human normal human being because we taught and very wrongly thought this is a monkey that the animal that we see on the trees it is not at all is a great mistake and this anumana the banner of civilization was vast and very prosperous it sprayed it in him Allah Mahindra Parbat Binda barbata kailasha Mandurah and many South Indian Hills this is a huge they were having the twin despair but this clan this group of people they used to they like to dress themselves as anumana so this is and in that we find that there's that they call they like to dress like monkey including the till copy nam Kela langu l'm Eastham copy nang Kela langu l'm Eastham Parvati bhushanam Bhushan Bhushan Amin's dress today is to love to dress themselves like that and there's to go like that it doesn't mean that there sometimes you will find that when there's everyone is having some symbols in America they have the Bulls they have the Bears and the symbols are great clubs and their fans almost all of them they will have the t-shirt having that picture and some of them they will cover their face and hate with a bear or like that there and they will go and they will clap and they will enjoy does it mean they did now after say five thousand years if someone is writing oh the Americans they were all be wrong that way one should not understand I don't know why and how this wrong conception came Xiaomi Vivekananda also said whenever there is an opportunity I try to mention these because this wrong conception should go Hana mana was a yogi and he was a devotee and yogi means concentration or the controlling of the mind is not possible for any animal it is only possible for not only man very high level the culture person then only he can control his mind and emotions on Ivana and the clan the Bonner a yachty bar Nura clan they were human beings only so this is about the hanumana and his devotion his love he only knew three Ramachandra nothing else to win the Masters Ramakrishna is mention that one attains liberation through bhakti alone and what is this liberation what is this Mukti the Mukti the liberation sometimes some people they don't like to take part in again and sometimes some people they love so much the divine play that is going around to observe that and to enjoy they'd like to leave long till the whole thing is going back once again so who knew vana she was blessed by his master Sri Ramachandra and he said o mighty one in the clan of bonnaroo all your prayers will be fulfilled because the prayer means Hanuman a said I want to leave and want to survive to see your divine play master so this whole world so many things are going on happening there's nothing but the divine claim he realized that he understood that but at the same time he wanted to keep himself in a distance so Drita bhava adroit Ababa merging with the God merging with the supreme and forgetting about the self but the Deuter bhava this I know that you were one I know that I am also you but at the same time I like to keep a little distance a separation so that I can enjoy your play the so many dramas are going on all around I like to enjoy this so he prayed in that way and the Ramachandra and his last day he placed on one of it is o mighty one in the clan of bonnaroo all your prayers will be fulfilled as long as my name will remain in this world so long people will devotedly remember you as long as my name will be there in this world you will be remembered devotedly by the people yet riot raghunatha kill tanam that recruiter mustika Angeline bash Parvati Polly punaluu janam ma routine numata Raksha Shanta come hit bent palms folded in adoration and every place he frequents every place where Rama's name is glorified he's still living and wherever people taking the name of Shri Rama Chandra is present devotedly if you are taking the name of Rama his the carrier of the messenger he will come and evil and I'll show me the Brahmin and achieve Aras he saw the Hanuman came and sat and he was listening to their Amla in balloon Mart they were having the ROM naam and Mirage the Brahmin and the G the first president of the Ramakrishna order he introduced the ROM naam the mostly South and North India they do eastern India it was not so much but the in ramakrishna mission ramananda ji introduced the ROM naam and he said you must keep a separate seat that we keep the photo and we offer food to the Sri Ramachandra but Brahman and the G saw Hanuman a came he sat in one corner he was also listening to the name of God his beloved God see Rama Chandra and naturally Brahman and the G saw it and then introduced you must offer his seat respectfully and also food for who knew Mahna Mahna Mahna was nothing but the Rama in different form he opened his heart and showed it was nothing but Rama it is an allegorical E it says but in reality when a person is going on devotedly taking the name of his idol he transformed into that the sometimes they saw is not mother transforming to see Ramakrishna mashallah domine TB serum sri ramakrishna that the one disciple he was worshipping his guru Swami Vivekananda and he used one vessels and utensil that used for Ramakrishna spooge a-- and that time very austere and very devoted preeminent the ji maharaj was there Shami he told his devotee don't do it if Premanand earth sees that you scold you but when almost he finished preman on the G entered into the room and Swamiji immediately said look this fool he is worshipping me utilizing the utensil that you use for ceramic is nur what was the reply of the prime Ananda he said are you different ceramic isne and you Vivekananda were all both the same so this Rama Chandra and Hanuman though they are separate but at the same time Hanuman was nothing but the Ramachandra so is it says like that and the friends that we are so happy that we could have some idea about the only one and today is the Hanuman Jayanti thousands of people they are worshipping Hanuman ji and this Hanuman Chalisa is there the 40 verses are on amana the devoted people they believe if you chant that then the Hanuman will protect you this is Mohave anumana only a few days before that Maha veer Jain we worshipped but that is a different car that is a different religion religion means about different path that is Jain religion and there the the God also is known as Mohave Jane I this is Mohave Hanuman he had the Mojave his name was Muhammad and here the Mohammed is a title his there is a very powerful personality and his power is physical spiritual and mental also he will bless if we pray to this mahabad hanumanji now let us continue with the gospel of ceramic Asner he he was talking about the Dru bar because the devotion the word devotion came one attains liberation through bhakti alone and why he said that because has remained the liberation is possible only if you born in a Brahmin family no the Brahmin means you have to make yourself uplifted to that Brahma brahmana would the brahmana Bea's constantly one who can constantly think that everything all around is nothing but the manifestation of God all the supreme self the consciousness that is called Brahman Makhijani and that person who can constantly think and keep his mind uplifted to that spiritual level he is only brahmana not by birth but by carbon so that is the reason Sri Ramakrishna is telling shrug shibori was the daughter of a hunter she and the read are and many others belong to the shudra caste but they were liberated through the bhakti alone so this is the eye we have to understand now this Hinduism some people they follow it they understand it properly and meaning they are making the mistake again and again they don't they go just blindfold devotion is good love for Hinduism is good love for an ideology is good but not it closed eyes we have to understand what at it means who is a brahmana what the sastra says some other day we can dis discuss about this caste systems of Hinduism now he recognized true spiritual greatness but not as much as he recognized Prahlada when law to say true go had great yearning for God from his boyhood I said that there was nothing greater than the bhakti that shot no end and had no selfish motive this is very important bhakti has no selfish motive when we go with all the it's called the offerings to God and if you are thinking we are offering this to God so that we will get these days days days this is not bhakti that's why Rami Vivekananda said lob knows no barter we have to exchange no it is not possible I am giving you these in exchange you give me that that is not devotion the ceramic is not mentioned that hosta contradicted me I say to him a wealthy man is annoyed when a petitioner comes to him there he comes he says angrily sit down he says to him in an indifferent voice and shows that he is much annoyed he doesn't allow such a beggar to ride with him in his carriage so see how the ramakrishna observed if you go to a rich man with the prayer the naturally that gentleman may not like you again and again if you approach so obviously no question that he will give a ride in the same carriage or same car no question that he will entertain you when you go to him because he knows that he has come to take some money but if you go with love if you go into affection if you go it without any prayer then that man will feel oh he loves me obviously his behavior with that person will be different this is bhakti and here we have to understand when you go to God we go with love only I love you so I come to you and I pray sometimes we pray now every day we are praying and everyone should pray to God oh please make this whole human their society all over the world are suffering so oh god please with your mighty power and merciful attitude now please bless this humanity human soul and enough is enough they have suffered a lot now please withdraw these and save them we can bring so not for me but for everyone but at the same time when we are in great difficulty we can go to the God and say you are my father you are my mother I don't have anyone else in this world to tell these who shall I go and to whom shall I say so this is my problem God please help me that also we can do but hodges attitudes were different I will worship God I will worship if I get in exchange money wealth respect all these things that is exactly what Saddam o Krishna is mentioning that is not good now but Hossler said that God was not like such will the people of the world and when Saddam Krishna gave the example has rekon redic today God is not like that he did he lack wealth the Hara is constantly thinking of that God should give the wealth that he should feel pinched to give it away hosta said father when rain falls from the sky the Ganges and all the big river and lake overflow with water small tanks to our field likewise God out of his grace glands wealth and riches as well as knowledge and devotion God when we are praying for will give us wealth when we pray for success giver success but when we are attending to God try to realize God then the lab comes we are discussing about the love bhakti and dad cannot come when we go for his wilt the ceramic isne tried to convince Hazra with that Raja could not understand many of the people don't understand that even a prince or princess the daughter and son and daughter of a king if they go and constantly ask the father oh you have so much of wealth how much you are going to give me and at the time of death and rich man's children if they go and ask the father father before your death you must make a will and this much portion he should give it to me will the father will be happy I Love You Father but I want that out of your wealth this much should be given to me and that you can give it to my brother or sister no the father will never be happy the similarly we can pray to God but not that our lab should based on that wealth that in exchange we are going to get that is the idea to the devotees but I call these impure devotion to God ceramic each name is mentioning I call these the impure devotion to God pure devotion has no desire behind it you don't want anything from me but you love to see me and hear my words my mind also dwells on you I wonder how you are and why you are why you don't come that is love when I feel for God when I like to see God every time talk to God every time when the others are there I avoid God known is the first preference is the most important like that if I go to God God will also never forget me he's also think who he loves me so much like I have noticed the grandchildren the grandparents they love their grandchildren more than their own children with the grandchildren the small kids they don't want anything from the grandfather except love an attention they will go grandpa you know I saw the bird the bird was talking to me the grandpa will be so happy and they will never forget that grandchild was talking like this so that enjoyment the company that is called devotion do we go to God and talk to God and just as we go to our father and grandfather the grandmother and loved them similarly if we go to God and love them God will also love me so that is called devotion friends the ceramic each dimension one attains liberation through bhakti alone we don't need any other paths only devotion what is the devotion love love without any butter without anything in exchange just love of God and that we find in Hanumanji we will discuss about this again and read from the page 592 of the book and then we'll discuss thank you and let us conclude with this our prana mantra niranjan um Needham Ananta rupam
