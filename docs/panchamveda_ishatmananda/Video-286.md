[287. Panchama Veda 287 : Can Only But a Brahman Achieve Perfection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnNUkZwE1A)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this evening we'll be discussing uh the panchama veda gospel of krishna a very important topic but let us begin as usual with this now one person he was asking question but this was happening when the devotees they were celebrating bhagavan si ramakrishna's birthday at dictionary the conversation and the girish ghost came so girish he was asking a question can one realize god by sadhana the bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning people have realized god in various ways some through much austerity worship and devotion they have attained perfection through their own efforts this is one way a group of people they are trying in their own way and as per the injunctions of the scriptures as per the instructions of the gurus so they practice by that way they also realize the brahman the god now some are born perfect as for example narada and sukadeva regularly daily usual normal siddhiya is perfect nitya eternally perfect there are also those who have attained perfection all of a sudden it is like a man's unexpectedly coming into a great fortune again there are instances of people's realizing god in a dream and by divine grace so there are so many different ways one can realize god so that is the beauty of the hinduism the sanatana dharma they always say if you are sincere you will surely realize god what is that god realization knowing its own self so that is the main idea and how it is possible when mind is collected it is not connected with the objects of the world and it is completely collected one pointed and focused on god and then obviously it becomes that way free it may be indifferent previously some people in the previous births they have done something and in this life they start from there and immediately they themselves can understand how it is possible this is a beautiful story bhagavan siram krishna himself said maybe we'll come afterwards the one person he was he went to collect some that the firehood and inside the jungle then he became dirk and he was afraid that he won't be able to go out of the jungle uh in that night so he climbed on a tree waiting for the dre brick so at that time he saw one person he was practicing the tantra sadhana he brought a dead body under that tree and he arranged all the puja he sat on that and he was going on uttering the mantras and slowly slowly that person he was attained simply listening to that mantras and he was also because there was no nothing else to do he was also repeating that and finally when almost everything was done then suddenly one tiger pounced on that person who was doing the austerity and killed and took him away now this the the person who went to collect the  he was sitting on the tree he came down knowing that since the tiger has already got his food it won't come back again so he then sat out of curiosity on that asana that place where that man was sitting and doing the austerity the moment he altered those mantras we which he was going on repeating and listening because almost whole night the moment once he acted immediately goddess kali appeared before him and to what wanted to give him the boon this man told ma mother he was so gracious but i'm curious to know i didn't do anything i was just out of curiosity sat on this but the person who organized the whole thing why he was killed by a tiger why you have not given him the darshan manifested before him then the mother told well my son you have already completed all these things in your previous life only a little was absent in this life now this moment you have completed so i have manifested but he will have to wait for the next life so it is very difficult to explain anything how it goes the divine ways to win bhagavan sram krishna is telling that some people can truly realize god through dream not that suddenly each and every one every one of us are having some dream different type of dreams but not that every dream can help us to realize god it depends on our past karma past birth and our purity our withdrawal of the mind from the saints objects and all those but that is also possible then bhagavan siddharma krishna sang a beautiful song shama dhan kishabai pai can everyone have the vision of shamma is kali the treasure for everyone oh what a pity my foolish mind will not see what is true abod krishna remain in ecstasy a few moments girish and the other devotees were seated before him a few days earlier girish had been very rude to master at the star theater but now he was in a calm state of mind now those who have already read the biography of bhagavan sirama krishna know this incident gidesh gosh he was a very moody person and naturally the other people they used to misunderstand girish thinking the why bhagavan sirama krishna goes to him when he is not properly behaving nature but sirama krishna who could read the mind who could see the mind so obviously knew the girish was a great devotee he was having complete faith outwardly he used to behave like that the sudama krishna that is the reason he used to go over there and used to talk to him master to girish this mood of yours is very good it is peaceful now the girish has come he's talking he's serving asking question so the master is appreciating this mood i prayed about you to the divine mother o mother make him peaceful so that he won't abuse me the sirama krishna he is telling that your mother please he should not abuse me so this is the way the sudama krishna is praying to mother the divine mother girish to aim to master mashay i feel as if someone were praising my tongue i can't talk now the prayer of bhagavan suramar krishna we can understand how things can change bhagavan is salam krishna himself is that when he is mentioning the mother mother kali it doesn't mean some other entity it is the power of god though apparently sudama krishna was worshiping the divine mother ma kali and that was to teach to us how to concentrate how to practice austerity how to be one pointed to realize god but he himself was that now he is praying as if why he said this i pray to the divine mother so our faith comes to the divine mother you know at that time when sudama krishna advented and he was establishing the religion the people they were thoroughly confused about religion the different type of people they were talking about different ways different means and so many mysticism also came different cults came so those who have read that the that time the society the condition so sudama krsna's contribution to bring back the faith as the existence of god god is there i am with all am taking telling you the god is there you can talk to him you can see him that was bhagavan sirama krishna the main contribution of bhagavatam krishna to bring back the pure faith on the existence of god the sudama krishna is pray said that i pray to the mother and girish is telling the master masha i also failed someone is pressing my tongue i can't talk see ramakrishna was still in an in-drawn mood he seemed to be gradually forgetting the men and the objects around him friends this is so rare those who are trying to practice meditation they know it very well when we are trying to concentrate even for a second it's so difficult almost all people the only the question that they constantly ask how to concentrate i don't get peace i am constantly trying but i am not getting the peace because there are so many desires are there some expressed desires some hidden desires so many things are in the mind we are not knowing the mind so that is the reason we cannot concentrate and when it becomes through practices and the grace of god it becomes purified that means not attracted for the worldly objects then immediately it goes into that deep mood those who have realized it they understand it and those who have developed the process of meditation sometimes some people nowadays almost everywhere in 30 days learn meditation like that they teach us i don't know how but anyway if they're successful very good but one should be careful about it meditation means withdrawing the mind from the saints objects and putting it on a particular divine object that is the basic of meditation then going beyond that object and merging into the original and that is the ultimate the bhagavad-gita now and then as it's so natural so normal the other people they used to wonder how it is possible and here we find the surama krishna he is gradually forgetting main and the objects around him you know that when you are meditating must be your guide and the guru has said that you have to forget yourself you have to come out of your body and to see your the chosen i deity inside your mind who is sitting and looking to that direction to which you are seeing looking that means you have to forget your body that is the main thing and also all around again and again in different way that is the ultimate meditation suramar krsna's mind going into that then he looked at looking at the aim he said they all come to dakshinesha let them mother knows everything so many varieties of people coming some are curious some are critic some are genuinely devotee so different type of people are coming so in the bhagavad-gita so those who are seeking the help the divine help so they come to god then some curious people they also come what is happening what is that so they are coming urtharti they have some desire to fulfill so thinking that if the blessings of god my desire can be fulfilled then it is okay but gyani there is truly they are sincere to know about the spiritual life so these four types of people are coming so rama krishna also observing and he is telling the mother knows everything mother will take care of it the different type of people are coming to him and they're talking they're asking question he is answering but it is not possible for him so he is telling mother knows mother will no to a young man of the neighborhood he said hello what do you think what is the duty of man so he used to ask this question to many he asked the question to that the famous person we have already read that chapter all sat in silence to narayan he said don't you want to pass the examination but my dear but my dear child a man freed from bondage is shiva entangled in bondage is jiva the sheba and jiva shashiva means divine the jiba means a soul bound because of the desire sriram krishna is teaching this to the devotees the narayan that young boy was sitting he's encouraging him to pass the exam but at the same time when you are going to pass the exam the another then the job search then they settle one after another comes so he's also giving the warning be careful about that suramar krishna was still in the god intoxicated mood there was a glass of water near him he drank the water he said to himself why i have to drunk water in this mood it was not yet dusk sirama krishna was talking to atul see friends when we read the gospel master masha he never left anything whatever he heard he noted he reproduced so obviously sometimes those who are not aware of the nature of a divine personality when they are withdrawn so they can't understand actually what they are doing but the other people who are observing sitting over there they can feel what is happening why is behaving like this they can't understand him even when we are reading this those who are not aware about the ramakrishnas that divine life they may misunderstand why what is there a glass of water was there he drank and then why is talking like this that particular mood sometimes many of you have experienced those who are practicing meditation after practicing meditation for one hour when you are slowly getting up you don't like to talk have you not felt that you don't like to see anything you like to be quiet for another say another ten minutes fifteen minutes and that is good sometimes it is said masha'allah also said that when you are practicing meditation that you are not successful then you got up and immediately become very busy you should not do that because the mind is coming down slowly and that is the greatest in a difficulty to come down the mind the wind the mind is coming down and slowly you are getting up or sitting on the same seat for some time looking at the picture of the god or goddess empty mind suddenly the realization may come that feeling divine feeling may come or maybe that you have got up and you will feel that we don't like to talk anyone you don't like to go or do anything it takes time to come down because there are two completely different realm one is this external another internal and when we go by the grace of god even for some time if just few moments to that internal realm it is so wonderful we don't like to come out of that each and every one of us we want peace joy happiness bliss that is the goal of human life but unfortunately we think the power administrative power and different type of wealth and these that will give me the peace it is again and again each page of history is telling the truth it is not one cannot be happy with all this why but it's temporary today this moment you may think that i am so and so next moment you are nowhere look at the round the history that is happening every time someone or other who was yesterday he was a king and today is nobody so it goes on because the nature is temporary so where we are satisfied inside us yes but many of us we don't believe it there's a great source of joy is there within us within our mind when we can completely control our mind controlling the mind means the thoughts thoughts of what thoughts of the objects so that is exactly what bhagavan siddha krishna is showing us teaching us now it was not yet dusk ramakrishna was talking to atul who was seated in front of him when master masha is writing he's giving a picture if you can imagine you can transport yourself to that particular time when sudama krishna is dakshinesha and that gentleman atul is sitting before him atul was girish brother and a lawyer of the high court of calcutta the girish ghosh she was a dramatist and was very famous in those days and his brother was also very famous he was a high court calcutta high court please very famous in those days and that was the undivided india right from kabul and down to sri lanka and burma everything was that india ruled by the britishers at that time calcutta high court we can imagine there he is the barrister a brahmana neighbor was also seated near him now this brahman is asking now when we read the brahmin or the shatriya it is it may be difficult for the westerners to understand it so in the indian we will discuss that afterwards this brahmin the higher caste sometimes the people they say why because they do the worship they mainly they say they claim that the brahmins are connected with the good work good thought and to divine divinity the brahman is asking can anyone but a brahmana achieve perfection he is asking to suramar krishna usually the ordinary people they always think brahmin only can realize the brahman realize the god and no one else now here is a great question what brahmin means friends today i will try to discuss quoting from our the mahabharata and other scriptures what is this brahman hood the moment he asked this question can anyone but a brahman achieve perfection master was not happy listening to this question he his reply is why should you ask that it is said that in the kali yuga the sudras achieve love of god there are instances of shabari then redash the the untouchable guaca and others those who are accustomed with the ramayana mahabharata these great histories of this india they will immediately understand and recognize these names this guhaka he was used to do perform the mainly hunting and selling the meat and the skin and all those at the time of sri ramachandra and the other job that there is to do that crossing the people from this shore to that shore with by boat and third this to help people to burn their dead bodies so that was all that should they used to do so the guhaka was the leader of that and the whole clan maybe they were known as that quagga the chandala but sri ramachandra he never cared for the work that he is doing he saw the mind of the person so three ramachandra he went and embraced that person but now unfortunately those even those worshipping sri ramachandra will never go and do the handshake even with those type of people those who are working that what is the difference why not in america and other countries they never think in that way of course in europe that is there hierarchies are there wherever there is a kings and they are working kingdoms that hierarchies are always there but america completely free from that this is a great country that's why swami vivekananda introduced vedanta over here now let us see how the why bhagavan suramar krishna is telling like that and he is asking that person why you are asking this question and sirama krishna mentioned about the kohaka and shabari and ridash is more modern but the shabari he was the daughter of a shower shavaram is a hunter and that shabari was a great devotee of sri ramachandra sri ramachandra was in life that time he was moving inside the jungle and chevrolet heard the sudama krishna will be sri rama will be coming through this way so she was waiting over there years together she was waiting and every day she used to clean that path from through which the sri ramachandra will come and she used to keep everything neat and tidy sri rama will come he will sit over here i will offer the glass of water i will offer fruits so that was and she was going on praying praying waiting waiting for the god to come when the god came she became elderly by that time and she was so excited so overwhelmed then she was tasting the fruits thinking that i should not give any any fruit which is not good taste so she was testing herself first and then it she was offering to sri rama this is a good taste you can take this one without hesitation so ramachandra was eating that can the brahmins of today will do that that is the question we worship sri rama but we don't see the quality of that god so that's why we have to learn now friends in the bhagavad-gita lord sri krishna has very clearly mentioned that the supreme lord has allotted four responsibilities to four human groups which is known as varna veda this burna means the color if literally burna means color veda that is the difference why the color is the quality why the color because sattva rajatama and this swatwa is white color then raja is red and tama is black so this sattva raja tama is identified with three different color white red and black so here it says varna veda the difference because of the color swatha raja and tama now in the bhagavad-gita again in the 18th chapter and 41 words i i read that i quote that brahmana shatriya bisham sudra nancha param tapa karmani prabhi bhaktani shabhaba the duties of brahmins shatrias bashars and sudras have been allotted according to the capacities capacities means gunas the guna means a tama and that is why the barna veda this bharnaveda and jaati veda these are the two words now mostly some people because of their selfish motive self self interest they are making it jaati veda jathi is hereditary but the burn of either it is according to the qualities as per the quality now the god himself is telling that i have divided the human being in these four groups why because of the society we need these four groups now what are these groups what are the qualities one should have to know as brahmin in the bhagavad-gita again in the 42 words it says damo now these are the words the students of vedanta they're very much aware of all these they know these words what is that dhamma the control of the mind then sorry shama means control of the mind then dhamma the control of the senses then shama dhamma control of the mind control of the senses and we have five sense organs this all these five senses taba austerity what is the austerity a forcefully controlling all our saints organs then according to mahasarathamani devi to keep the mind always thinking about god that means withdrawing the all the organs sends organs from the saints objects and thinking only about the god that is called austerity stopper socham cleanliness this is very very important in the spiritual life the physically and mentally one should be clean the mental cleaning means pure thought positive thought physical cleaning of course we know shanti forbearance arjubam uprightness they're very straightforward and no ambiguity no hypocrisy that is called arjubam gyanam knowledge the idea about everything and beginner realization astikum a faith faith in the existence of god and faith in one's own power that is called the brahmana now if these qualities are there then one can think that one is a brahmana that this is what our lord sri krishna is mentioning in the bhagavad-gita the hindu scripture if you say it in hindu scripture hindu should know it hindu should follow it because this caste system with which we are constantly till today in the modern times also we are constantly talking about it and thinking about it and then making the differences among these people we shouldn't understand that who can be called as the brahmana just out of because he was born in a brahmin family know at all who can be considered as shatriya the shatriyas the other day one person came that we we are shatriyas what are the shatrias just because we are born somewhere and having some surname of that nothing it's a shojam that is heroism what is this heroism you know that is swami vivekananda and the british gentleman and the lady those who have read the biography of vivekananda you know that they were as a walking it was almost afternoon in england in the middle then cows were there suddenly a bull she may be seeing what it changed so when it was coming rushing so obviously it was the naturally the the two male were there swamiji and the gentleman they were supposed to help that lady in state that british gentleman those who are very famous for these but for the soldier for the heroism he climbed on a tree and waiting for the bull to come swami vivekananda stood over there protecting the lady who fell on the road and waiting for the bull to come at church that is called hiddenism the soja never afraid of death and protecting those who needs the protection so this is called heroism tejo high spirit i have taken the oath that i am going to do this i must do this that is called this high spirit driti firmness and draksham resourcefulness he must be having good qualities and the wealth also jude de cha opi or palayanam and never retreat from the battle it's not all the time that the bat the moment we say about the battle that that is a different picture comes and different type of battle challenges the xiaomi vivekananda about him the sister nibedita said that he was more a soldier than a sannyasi but that heroism was there that courage was there challenge after challenges he came here in america when the american people never heard about the country india and there he was spreading hinduism and vedanta which was unthinkable so many difficulties so many challenges and he said the more opposition more the power the lion rise within me so that is called judd palayalam appalayanam never retreat from the battle dhanam these people are very generous ishar bhavasya it capacity to rule capacity for the administration that is not in all people then maybe the second people you know the majority of the people are very good followers but the leaders are very few they can understand they can think they can make the decisions that is ishwara bhava here it is not divine but the administrative capacity that is called shaatra karma and capable to do trade and business are the duties of the bhakshas and helping and serving the society are the duties of the sudras in the ancient scripture we find particularly shaitara upanishad a word called barnaveda what is that varna in the shaitaru punisher it says lahita shukla krishna red white and black that means satya raja and tama so it is barna here it says barnabed why bharna brahmana's qualities are all our sattva the good qualities there's all satthars are there that's why it is white and then others in the comparatively mod modern time the word is used to describe this division of labor as jaati veda caste system this is according to heredity that is not correct now the modern hindus should understand they should read the bhagavad-gita they should read the mahabharata they should read the other scriptures nowhere these divisions were there unnecessarily we are thinking in this way and the hindu body is becoming more weak that thinking we love hinduism and they are the shouting for the hinduism not knowing unknowingly they are weakening the hindu body the hindu religion the hindu philosophy the division of duties according to quality and the division of duty according to heredity all hindu scriptures support the fast one according to quality not heredity in a conversation between sage vrigu and sage bharadwaja the great bhrigu said when when brahma created human being there was no difference between person to person all were endured with great good qualities all were brahmanas then as days passed according to karma from these people who were having brahmana quality sleep to other qualities and what is that in mahabharata we find iti karma vivasta means the different groups antara different barna antara so the brahmin according to the karma some of the brahmins maybe a father is having four son one is having all the good qualities that the brahmanas are supposed to have like shama dhamma tapa shoja all these second boy is having shojam deja driti daksham so all the qualities of the second third is very good in business and fourth is very good in helping others he can't take decision himself that capacity is not there but he's a very good helper so by that way one father having one son brahman another son shatriya then the bhusha and the shudra there is no problem so this is the way that in the beginning the vigou and the bharadwaja they are in their discussion they mentioned about it then as days passed according to their karma they slipped again in mahabharata we find is describing why it is so so many times in the mahabharata that is there it has been this discussed and described because you know that time this thing came very strongly at the time of ramachandra it was not that way but at the time of sri krishna there's so much this thing came so karna as because he was raised in a lower caste family though he was to drive the kurds so he was not considered as a shatriya and in the shatria games though he was capable to do that he was not allowed those who have read the mahabharata they know about it so all this great bhagavata war because of this wrong conception that they didn't get the respect from the society because though they were having the quality because of their birth and two brahmins they were born in the brahmin family and they were raised in that they had the good quality but they took up as a profession the shatria dharma they were the acharyas this to teach the military training the if for the koda burst students so naturally the brahmins is working as a shatriya and the bashas and sudras are not getting the opportunity so that created problem in the society at the time of mahabharata the great war mainly was because of that so that is the reason in the bhagavad-gita the bhagavan krishna who was the main the character in the mahabharata so he is telling like this and in mahabharata itself the vyasadeva is describing that this is a wrong conception we should understand it is the quality awkward quality not by birth when a person manifest qualities in his or her behavior the categories that person according to the quality mentioned before should be the category when we are categorizing that is a brahmana shatriya baish etc we should not see where he was born or she was born but the qualities that they are having in a person it change the quality if a person change the quality can that person's category also be changed if we ask this question then it says of course sure in mahabharata again pervert says if a brahmana behaves like sudra and the sudra like say brahmana then we should consider them accordingly if the brahmana is not behaving as a brahmana he should not be considered as a brahmana sometimes the sannyasin the sannyas conception came much afterwards when the previously it was the rishi as a muni and then much afterwards came the sannyasa if a sannyasi who is supposed to be completely given up if he is behaving is a grabbing and ruling and doing these and that in the society he should not be considered as a sannyasi if a brahmana behaving like a sudra drinking fighting and all different type of things that those people they do he should not be considered as a brahmana just because he was born in a brahmana family so this is the idea now the cost depends on quality not on birth friends so we can remember that a doctor came to visit mahasarathamani devi's house in bagbajar calcutta there that ma after all the he checked all the the people over there when he was leaving maha sharon devi asked the children go and touch the feet of the doctor and express your gratitude the other ladies came and whispered mother he is not a brahmana we are all brahman our children cannot go and touch the feet of a non-brahmin the mother who has not read the scripture just because of her realization very clearly then and they are mentioned he is such an educated person he is serving the ailing people if he is not a brahman then who is a brahmana go and touch the feet of that so that solves all the problem if we can understand these swami vivekananda said everyone should be raised to brahmana brahman in bengali everyone should be raised to that quality now in ramakrishna mission the sannyasins many are there one not born brahman now the not only that from different religious groups also the sannyasins are there the some traditional people again because of the wrong conception there is question and they'll be asking how a non-brahmin can accept or get the sannyasa if you see the process of the ramakrishna mission swami vivekanda himself he made that rule when a boy is coming it is a good quality all the as a two is ready to become a sannyasin we should not consider his family his birth or the religious background or whether poor or rich like that now fast 10 years he should go through the brahmacharya period 10 years the brahmacharya means he should be constantly practicing a routine life then there will be naturally when leaving a community life there are chances to become angry to criticize others and these that and the seniors will be observing them are they too much critic hyper critique or not sometimes people they criticize just only to express the anger that's all that is okay not natural for the human being but the hypercritic or not whether obeying the orders of the seniors are not serving others are not having the faith in the existence of god or not reading the scriptures or not performing the work properly or not and whether he is having desire for name fame or not all these will be constantly they will observe and then after nine years on the tenth year he will become a sannyasi now first three years they will be observing then next again the five years two years of course there is a training is there then after that another four years they will have that very much earlier name then to sannyasa after the 10 years rigorous practice their mind is obviously it goes upward and they become brahmin that is the unique way swami vivekananda introduced this path anyone can become a brahmana and when you achieve that brahmana the good when you have achieved all those good qualities you are eligible to accept sannyasa you are a brahmana so that is what swami vivekananda said gautama samhita is a very famous scripture it says na o king a man is not honored only for his birth but for his qualities as because i am i'm a son of so and so the people will accept me and give me all the respect no if you don't have the quality you won't get that the great people their sons are not getting that respect look there is no quality biddar sagar's son he was not so famous as bit dashagar because he was not having those qualities that the bidders was having so that is natural not jaati pujjati rajan just because you are born they don't give you respect because of your quality guna kalyanakara bhagavan sirama krishna i will conclude with this and you will again go back to the pages of the gospel of sirama krishna the devotee have no caste so that is why we are discussing this because this is very important for the hindus and particularly in this modern age at this time we should understand this it is the quality not the birth sudama krishna then narayan is smiling brahmins and sudras all are one that young boy is a student who was visiting sirama krishna when sudama krishna said these that to that gentleman his smilings and brahmins and sudras are all one because he developed the spiritual qualities it is the human being that is man how he is behaving that is man so he mentioned like that brahman that gentleman again is asking can a man realize god in one birth he is not asking brahman previously he was asking is only the brahmin can realize god the surama krishna rebuked and then this person is asking can a man realize god in one birth this is a very important question and bhagavan si ramakrishna is replying is anything impossible for the grace of god he is asking another question giving the reply any moment anyone can get the realization because it is in the power of god grace of god what is this grace in sanskrit it says kripa this creeper sometimes it is said you have to perform then you have to get you have to perform kri means action power means achieve you have to perform then only you will get what we should have to perform going on the in the cave and sitting over there and meditating maybe but the easiest way the simplest way that bhagavan sudama krishna said just have faith in the existence of god and think god as your mother and you can go to your mother with anything whether you are clean or not whether you are after bathing or not you have any way you can go to your mother mother is always there masharadamani devi in one of her conversations he said when the children are coming with dirts it is the mother they clean and they take them on their lap children don't understand that means if we are making any mistakes even we are committing something wrong but if we are repainting for that and go to the mother i am sorry i won't repeat it there itself the mother will say it is okay so that is the way sirama krishna is mentioning is anything impossible for the grace of god suppose you bring a light into a room that has been dark a thousand years the unique example that suramar krishna is giving suppose you bring a light into a room that has been dark a thousand years does it remove the darkness little by little the room is lighted all at once to othul the the brother of girish chandra intense renunciation is what is needed renunciation means thiaga so what to renounce what we should have to give up ego intense that means the complete ego suppose we always say i don't know i can't do it i depend on god it will be jellyfish existence no not like like that you should have the shraddha so we have to understand this type of thing very clearly the srita means self-confidence not ego what is this i am fully convinced that god is there so the i can pray to god and the grace will come because god is so close to me god is my mother this is one second i have complete faith in myself when other people can do it i too can do it that is called satta and this is what he is telling as is needed one should be like an unseat sword when a man has that renunciation he looks on his relatives as black cobras and his home as a deep well that means slowly you have to withdraw the mind from all these objects the relatives the wealth the house the position if we like good continue and if you like to be free from that then you have to renounce how not that immediately giving up everything i become a wandering monk not like that attachment to those things i am not talking to any relatives or my children grandchildren because i have read in the gospel that sudama krishna said you are all cobras then what will happen all relatives will say ban this book because our parents are behaving like this so it is not like that it is the attachment to those people whom we are thinking so close to us well we have done our duties now it is over thank you friends now if there is any question and then afterwards we will conclude the first question is from akshay he's asking what should we do when the mind is disturbed with intense desire okay so this is nothing wrong if the desire is there the some of the desires you should fulfill the desires which are not harming others i repeat that desires which are not harming others it is nothing wrong in satisfying those desires so this is the first thing secondly try to understand after satisfaction of those desires whether you are very much satisfied no mostly those who are elderly people ask them their experience no then you have to slowly slowly withdraw but not forcefully please understand anything you like you can do if it is not harming others and then pray to god minimize this desire o lord thank you the next question is from radha she is asking why some people cannot use the available help to change their bad qualities so actually of course you are thinking for others but it is better to think about ourselves so whatever the available the qualities are there i am utilizing i am trying to develop myself that is good you know no one can fix this whole world it is not possible it will be like this because actually nothing is happening but everything is happening why because we are thinking in that way so that is that but anyway it is a completely vedantic outlook that whatever is happening let it continue let it go i have nothing to do with it i have to withdraw my mind from these worldly objects and i should focus on god that should be the ideology that's why bhagavan sirama krishna said the goal of every human life is to realize god don't think about all this whatever is responsibility you are having perform that and then collect your mind and focus on your goal that is god realization thank you sanheda is asking what is the simple way of removing anxiety in our daily life this is a good question very practical question the when the anxiety has come some problem has come and we are thinking how to overcome that problem that is the anxiety so suppose you think so many problems came in our life one after another it was solved it has been solved and this will also go so that way you can always say this shall also pass so one of our senior swamiji used to tell us this shall also pass this is a mantra so whatever the problem is coming all will be solved one day just wait and pray thank you shrima biswas is asking when somebody when someone is harming then what should we do of course you should do his thing that means a person when he's trying to harm you that not that that you should be afraid but try to prove that you can also harm him that's called heasing but not truly biting so that is the a main thing so but you know the prayer has wonderful power if you are praying to the god this god this person is disturbing me i cannot concentrate on you i cannot properly call on you i cannot pray to you that would it be possible to remove him from my life taking give him something else you'll see everything will be fixed the god has wonderful power and that person will be changed that is the way we can pray thank you friends it seems there is no other question so we will read uh chant this mantra and conclude niranjanam nityam anantharupam [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music]
