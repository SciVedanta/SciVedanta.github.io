[226: Panchama Veda 226 :How To be Free From Ego?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-UZs_xRkVM)

dear devotees and friends from today we will have the live stream of the and we are beginning with the Pancham of a that the gospel of Avalon ceramic is now you can see that I am not in the usual place our the pulpit and our shrine I'm sitting in my office why because of the situation and this is the first April 2020 and all over the world a situation is going on a problem is going on and each and every one all over the world every individual they cannot come out and this is their situation and so many of the devotees they requested me to start the this gospel and we will give the classes every day you have already received all our the males are the Flyers so this situation is what is the situation that is a coronavirus we know about it almost everywhere every time they all are talking about it we are not going to tell anything about it but if you notice the two different ways the human beings are trying to solve it in a sanskrit they say Tarbert bias survey tab IAM Javed Byam an algorithm algorithm to vayam bhikshapathi korea jetta chittim there's a beautiful the Zohar sit there it says that one should be very cautious about the problem before it comes to you that means one should be caution cautious and then when it has already calmed when you're standing face to face with that problem in that situation the one should try to solve accordingly that time one should not be afraid of so exactly the human being is trying to do that the one virus has come it is completely new and we do not know how to handle it and still the human being is trying to solve this problem in two different ways one externally that is the science is very active all over the world in different laboratories the scientists are trying to find out a medicine so that it can be curved the external approach to solve the problem and if you'll notice almost everywhere in every different groups the religions they are having this type of livestreams and taking the help of the modern machineries and the science we are trying to reach out to every people every individual who are now in the homes so are we are trying to give them the mental strength the spiritual strength and with that strength that he can face the problem and the scientists they are giving them the solution from the externally so from the external and internal both ways we are trying to find right out this the virus now you usually used to have the class on Tuesday but I have changed it from today I was thinking that you should have this class from Wednesday because Wednesday is the birthday of vagabond Sri Ramakrishna and Wednesday he was born on February 18 1836 so that was Wednesday so I thought it will be very good and you know today is a very very auspicious day today is the sunday of ostomy and namami this is the Navaratri puja that we are doing we are observing that this puja the original durga puja and here on the ninth day of this period sri ramachandra was born tomorrow is the Rama Navami so that is also a very special day after practicing the Navaratri austerity the Hindus they received the Supreme Lord in the form of three Ram Chandra so this is also very unique friends you must have noticed that this particular period is very auspicious for different religious people almost all religious groups are now practicing austerity the whole this period for the Hindus it is Navaratri Ram Navami for the juries it is Passover for the Christian it is Easter and for the Muslims this is Ramadan and all are practicing austerity all over the world all people according to the traditions of all these religious groups the devotees are supposed to assemble in their respective religious places like the temple synagogue charge and mosque but the whole world is now under lockdown system and obviously no one can go out of their houses but every individual every faithful every devotee they are practicing religion and how they are practicing in their own houses are alone or with their family members who were living together they are practicing this religion one thought that flashed in my mind observing this and is this the issuer the Jehovah the God the Allah the Supreme Being whom we call in different names is he indicating the human being to become spiritual to go over the institutional Ritualist religion that is called practice tannic Dharma that we have to go over that and to become calm and meditative maybe we do not know the ways of God but we should try to utilize whatever the situation for the our individual spiritual strength spirituality so let us start as usual with this mantra Tabu khatam rhythm Tata G bonham Kabir a little calm a sharper Ravana Mangalam srimad artem boobie goon on Te URI dodging are the Vagabond see Ramakrishna is kilometer taboc autumn rhythm kata Rupa Amrita Amrit means the nectar and how it reaches to us through the word the speeches and the instructions advices that is the Qatar and that gives the solace to top to jeonnam the peace to this the life but it's almost burning in this world and I am receiving so many phone calls nowadays from different parts of the world the people are calling and then they're talking with me and almost everyone is telling what to do now I told why but once I Ramakrishna is indicated and this is the time for you you can utilize it and he said Moni poni Koni in his own original Bengali language and inside the mind and go on repeating the holy name of God Moni poni and in a secluded place in a corner of a room and you have got this opportunity do it and go on reading the gospel of Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna are the holy books and you will get the solace and what is that solace an idea and what is this life friends when we will start reading this and I was wondering the page that you and we are supposed to read this page page number 589 and the date Saturday October 4th 1884 then Bhagavan C Ramakrishna he is visiting a devotees house and there he is speaking and master Marcia is three MA he recorded this and he is telling it was the day of the first full moon after Durga Puja Sri Ramakrishna arrived at the Calcutta House of no bean Shan the elder brother of cassiopeian Roisin those who are the students of Sudama Krishna they all know that the cash option was very close to Salaam Krishna and not only cushaw his old family and master machine recording it on the previous Thursday key shops mother had begged the master to pay her a visit in Calcutta the day they were having different places the houses in different places so her mother was requesting him to visit in Calcutta and ceramic ISNA has come and this was the house of Naveen Shan the master seated himself in a room on the upper floor of the house with him where Baburam Kishori and a few other devotees none the love and the key shops other nephew's key shops mother and other relatives of ease waited on the master it had been arranged to have devotional music perform in the room M was sitting in a room downstairs listening to the kitten so we can get the picture when bragan√ßa Ramakrishna is visiting the pasture of work we can see and the Avatara what is the work of Avatar what is the duty of Avatara avataras duties to stablished Dharma the disestablishing the Dharma people are confused completely confused about the religion what is the region and all justum mysticism you know the most of the people that think the mysticism the something will happen in the world and what is going to happen these that so many things they always think about but is that religion the religion is the realization as Rama Vivekananda puts it religion is realization and what is that to realize Sri Ramakrishna's words we will understand Sri Ramakrishna is telling used to visit different devotees houses and the local people they will all gather over there in those days it was not possible for the ladies particularly to travel to the dictionary to meet the ceramic Krishnan to listen to him so it was really good for them the ceramic richness to visit in different parts of Calcutta is a very big city didn't capital of India and it was under the British rule the sadhana Krishna is to go and meet the people and all the devotees the local people they will come and it is really good for the master martial mind the North Gupta he recorded the whole conversation this time he mentioned that he was sitting in the next room that that was in the and the ground floor and ceramic is nowand the first floor but he could hear he could listen see Ramakrishna said to the brahma devotees now we should we should now a pay attention to the word of a governess Ramakrishna what he is telling now we are actually passing through a very difficult period people are afraid of death and each and every one is behaving so peculiarly the more the days are passing the more the behavioral things are changing children are their behaviors are changing elderly people their behaviors are changing but why that is the question now hear the answer that the government say Ramakrishna is giving giving to those people those who understood what is religion listen to the ceramic wizna the world is impermanent one should constantly remember death think of it now when we are so much afraid of death each and every one even and 87 years old 92 years old they're also of course I am not criticizing but the thing is why so much of fear for death the world is temporary each and every one either today or tomorrow they're going to die and as I was quoting that Tsubasa ate of course we will take all the the precautions but at the same time not that craziness about the death it is not necessary I was reading in the newspaper very peculiar thing happened the one young brother he went out the elder brother was asking him not to go out of course now the government is telling that is the only way we can save ourselves not I am dying but at the same time if I am contaminated I am going to a create problem for many others so one should be careful but the young boy he went out of the house and then afterwards when he came back the elder brother became so angry he simply killed him so what is this that this is the the craziness that is coming and that is the point we should try to understand the wonderful words of ceramic business world is impermanent the world is not permanent each and everything is going to change either today or tomorrow of course we will take the action to save ourselves but at the same time should not become crazy on that the world is impermanent one should constantly remember death this is the highest teaching of spirituality the one should not miss and Stan this is the highest teaching of spirituality then he's singing a song that has expressed this idea so wonderfully remember these Oh mind nobody is your own vain is your wandering in this world trapped in the circle snare of Maya as you are do not forget the mother's name here in the song it is mother's name mother means that God and what is this Maya Maya means so much of attachment and there's so much of desire and all the misconception about this world another fabulously rich people they're having so many things and some people they're having really really lavishly they have spend the money for their own the comfort is okay can t help now now the world the whole world means little help they can but they won't majority of the people now they're hiding that thinking let me only survive and whatever happens to the world again they're making the mistake the somewhere in some corner this virus that grew and then all over the world each and every one is suffering as Swami Vivekananda said a single act on can take the dragged the whole world behind it it's proof that is true a single atom can drag the whole world we cannot live separately rich and poor the rich man is thinking I am safe let the poor suffer and die no it is not possible the same thing will happen to you so this is the way we must try to understand the world is temporary whatever is necessary for my comfort it is of course I should have and maybe different grades of things are there but at the same time that we should not become The Selfish Giant this is the time for the people those who are having the wealth to come out to help the world all over the whole government is trying all over every every administration is trying their best so now these people should come out and talk Avanza Ramakrishna said those who are having the money whose money is this gods and you are only the keeper and if you remember these the world is impermanent one should constantly remember death any moment anywhere it may come remember these Oh mind nobody is our own when is your wandering in this world trapped in the circles near of Maya as you are do not forget mother's name the last line is very important one should go on repeating the name of God remembering that God and trying to take the refuge in God in whatever form in whatever name they think it is that way one should then master again is telling the devotees dive deep what will you gain by merely floating on the surface renounce everything for a few days retire into solitude and call on God with all your soul is it not that the situation has come maybe this is a very peculiar situation but it is a situation let us utilize this there was a great patriot in India and he was highly educated he was ICS officer and from the London he got that and then he went back he could live a very happy prosperous life but he joined in that freedom movement in India and then he was arrested he was put in his cell and he was not allowed to meet anyone for a few days he was thinking how I'm going to survive even the food used to come below that door he could not see anyone he couldn't hear the sound of human voices for few days he was puzzled what to do and what not to do then he was thinking that one I'm going to be mad then suddenly one day one thought crossed his mind that changed the whole thing and that thought was oh the rishis of the old is to go in the solitude volunteer there-there is to go into solitude not to talk to anyone not to have the company of anyone not to mix with anyone this to go and see it and meditate it to study their own mind just to control their own nature and slowly slowly they became the master of their own minds so why not mean this is an opportunity that God has given to me I have been forced that in this prison but why not I utilize this so he started meditation and meditating meditating meditating slowly slowly he realized his own Hartman and the person who entered into the cell he was out of in the gorge a famous Patriot and when he came out of the cell after spending so many days he was Rishi Irwin de ravine the the knower of God so this Aravind er many of you know about him and he has a big followers and this out of in the he utilized the situation why not us now it is a situation now we can all everywhere wherever we are getting the information almost in every country shops are open for the food medicine and then slowly retired and of course there are people those who are not having that the money and all that problem is there apart from the leaving aside that those of you who are living inside the room you are having the provision and you can leave all alone and again and again you're trying to get solace from the Swami's and the religious people and secretly you are going to the temples and charge and moss it's not necessary you go beyond all this ritualistic thing and become spiritual how the cinema Krishna is giving deep dive deep what is this dive deep means sit quietly in one place close your eyes and if you are initiated take the Holy Name and count how many times you have done it today it is 100 tomorrow it is 200 and slowly slowly go on increasing increasing increasing and when you can reach to 10,000 as a ma shutter da monitor is telling if you can take the name of God 10,000 times then your mind will become calm and tranquil and peace will surely come and act with along with that of success and whatever way you like to utilize your mind you will be successful that doer one young lady she wanted some guidance I told this can you increase your japa and reading of holy books apart from other duties other work and slowly slowly she has increased today she rang me in the morning at 2:00 today she told that she has completed 11,000 times the another god she has taken initiation and going on repeating the name of God eleven thousand times and two the ram navami she's going to complete 12,000 times the mind is changing situation is changing people started loving caring and all this all around just by taking the name of God class by taking the name of God and that is the beauty of it that's why balance Ramakrishna is telling dive deep how to dive deep where we are diving within the mind and where is there in the mind different thoughts waves up thoughts varieties of thoughts in the beginning all those waves don't allow you to go down and slowly slowly when you are going on reading the holy books and are listening to the holy talks and getting yourself inspired and weary but you were just sit quiet for 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes go on increasing the time dive deep dive deep what will you gain by merely floating on the surface just I am reading different holy books and then I'm criticizing this and that religion is not doing this is not what you took it aside you do you show and religion means you have to prove and it has been proved by so many people so that has been the path is already chopped I need not to find out anew the path it is already there and only thing I have to practice it follow it renounce everything everything for a few days not for all not completely everything for a few days only what is the renouncement has to go to the pub has to go to the club has to go doing these and that I'm renouncing all these and there I had a habit of drinking every day drinking or the smoking I am giving up giving up giving up giving up so this way renounce for a few days and retire into the solitude you are already in the solitude all alone call on God with all your soul and when you are trying to remember God rememorize I mean visualize God if you cannot cry you go on crying at the feet of God and say God please help me then he is singing what is the song dive deep or mine dive deep in the ocean of God's beauty though you know then Hindus in our tradition they always teach that you should try to remember a lotus within your heart and then just visualize your chosen Idol your God whoever the maybe the God you know Hindus have so many thousands of gods and goddesses whatever whoever you like just think that that same God or God is a sitting within your heart facing towards that direction you are looking at you are facing so what will happen you will forget your body consciousness you are coming out of your body as if and that is called meditation meditation means what meditation means forgetting your body forgetting the place that you are around so forget all this so dive deep and in the ocean of God's beauty those who have practice a little meditation and the real meditation then they they can remember they can understand and they can tell you that when you see the light that is the falchion light within your heart it is so beautiful and so attractive you never you will never like to open your eyes you will think that no I like to go down and like to be over there when Swami Vivekananda was very young he used to practice meditation he was reaching over there and he was finding that beauty of God presents the when Saddam o Krishna one day arc steam - that he's enjoying the meditation and asked him what do you like to be when you grow and then you become elderly then he said I like to come out from my meditation and just to take some food to maintain the body and then I like to go and deep into that in inside the meditation it's so joyful of course he has a different mission the God brought him for a different mission so the god rebuked him and said why you are unselfish but for ours let us become a selfish and let us go down to that meditation let us enjoy that afterwards we will see but first see Ramakrishna is telling let us enjoy that beauty dive deep Oh mind who is going deep mind what is that mind full of thoughts and how to eradicate those thoughts by taking the name of God and how it is possible if you read some good book and then you sit for meditation your meditation will be good the I think two months before at in January when I was in India I was visiting the senior Swami's now after retired Swami's those who are very ill and they has a special houses there they all stay over there I entered into ashram is room I knew him very well now I saw that he is preparing for meditation then when a maiden sees he said I was reading Marsh or Adam on his life and as a preparation for meditation look at it so he I was reading a book just to prepare his mind for meditation if you read the other books are just observing a movie a straight go and sit for meditation you won't be able to control your mind because those thoughts will be on the surface but if you have read some holy books good book and then you are meditating those holy thoughts will help you so this is he said that if you listen to the uttermost depth there you will find the gem of love love means the joy oh I am alone I'm feeling frustrated I don't have anything to do no one to talk rather you will just think other way one should not come to me I should be alone I like to enjoy and that is the way it goes if you go to the Oregon if you see the in in a lonely room one elderly show me he is living there there so now see all alone he is leaving but so happy if you go and talk to him happiness is pouring out and that is called sannyasi and that is called spiritual life there are some people they say no we are not religious but we are spiritual what does spirituality mean spirituality meaning that the love the joy which is within us and now the situation has come we are forcefully we are in inside the room we cannot go out we cannot socialize but still this is the opportunity as Saddam occasion at ceramic isness request the brahma devotee also sang thou art my all in all o Lord the life of my life the essence of essence in the three worlds I have none else but deed to call my own so this through the songs there are wonderful teaching today when I started this I opened this page and this is the marked page I am supposed to read and I was wondering how the ramakrishna he is giving that just exactly what we wanted to read and listen and hear so this is how he is telling how I should pray oh my god you are my own and there is no one in this world shotgun Martin potala that there are three words and you know they're in the seven above and seven below they say in the purana I'm not going into that details but this three that means the supreme place this word the Haven in between heaven and the art so art in between place and that heaven in all this tree I have no one whom I can whom I can call my own you are my own so this is the way you have to call God in the three worlds I have none else but D to call on my own thou art my peace my joy my hope thou are my support my wealth my glory thou my wisdom and my strength the song goes on in this way this songs are actually not for entertainment these are all prayers pouring out all the truth the feeling that a devotee is feeling within it is coming out is pouring out through music through melody so that is called the devotional song the devotional song means the pouring out of my prayer so you are all in all and today we are noticing see Ramakrishna is also they are also singing cinema Krishna also as a teaching he is also singing through songs he is teaching Oh mother / - Oda thou wouldest dance when she called D her precious blue jewel ceramic is addressing mother but the jeshoda was the mother of the Krishna and blue GL nil money is the name of the Krishna then how come the Kali the mother that God is that ceramic Krishna worshiped became the Krishna so there is no difference you know then in Hindus they have a sect called Baba and the bush nobody worshiped the Krishna Sri Ramachandra and Vishnu vagabond there like this and there is another group called the tantrika they worship goddess Kali the Shiva Durga Shakti but Salam o Krishna is mingling this too and he is telling Oh mother for a Yashoda thou wouldest dance when she called DeHart precious blue jewel now this mother became Krishna that means the supreme being who is the consciousness taking different form in different condition because the condition of the devotees mind devotees attention and devotee wants to see that supreme being in the form of a mother in the form of Krishna so you at Slama Krishna is telling Oh mother you became Krishna the brahma devotee also sang to the accompaniment of cymbals and the drums Oh mother how deep is the love for men in the Brahmo Samaj they were not actually following the traditional way of the Hindus so they slowly slowly they were developing that God is not personal it is impersonal but at the same time they had all these songs why it is not possible for a ordinary mind is simply to see it and think about formless god so what will happen after few try then slowly slowly he will lose the confidence and hypocrisy will come in the hypocrite he will become though he is not developing anything but at the same time he will think he will tell people oh I am telling these I'm telling that so Hindus are that way very very practical so and they said why don't you think about a God in a form the mother the beautiful form mother do guys their mother Kali's their shoddy shoddy then Laxmi there's so many different forms now barratry means nine different forms of the mother say mother in ninety point forms so these are the beauties they are not separate they're all one but for my mind which is turbulent so I am giving an option you want this you want this even this and whatever every night nine days in different way and worshiping the same power the same consciousness now we have to remember the brahma devotees are singing and they are beginning the song with all mother how deep is the love for men the love for men mindful of it I weep for joy when I remember that the mother is all attentive to me she is taking care of me a great joy as soul as the support that I am getting and that brings tears to my mind to my eyes almost from the day of my birth I have transgressed dying every law look at him this is called confession mother I didn't listen to you almost from the day of my birth right from my childhood I didn't listen to you I didn't follow your advices but even then and still thou lookest on me with love comforting me with sweetest words mindful love it i we for joy Oh mother the burden of the love is far too great for me to be R now the realisation is coming we didn't listen to the holy words but the God has tremendous patience the God is waiting life of the life life of the life God is waiting the moment you say I am sorry your father I'm sorry your mother oh god I'm sorry please bless me please guide me please help me immediately forgetting all the foolishness that I did mistakes I did immediately the flow of love will come and that is called the divine love the divine love is always waiting for us that's why Raghavan C Ramakrishna is he said in one place the strong wind is always there blowing only thing you have to unfurl and then your boat will sell and with the speed and what is that faith faith in the existence of God and how I can develop faith by seeing the life of the holy people like bhagavati Ramakrishna Jesus Christ and the marsh or the money debian most of people so many all of them they are telling that they have realized God of course there are other people are also there they are just claiming that they have realized God and how to differentiate in the coming Sunday we are going to read the three questions took three Krishna and the bhagavatam the three questions to Krishna the first question how I understand who has realized God with the only man we will listen to that on the Sunday morning but the how will understand very simple he will not have any desire completely niche that desireless completely free from desire the dis desirelessness will obviously develop love so this is telling and when that is there and through this song we learned that the mother's grace the God's grace is always there and trying to reach me to guide me the moment I will call mother immediately the flow of the police will come Marshall a domani Debbie she once said whoever will call me as mother I will surely answer to his prayer or heart fear so that is the way the mother is waiting mother is compassion mother is love mother has no ego problem the why you have not listened to me before so now I am NOT going to help you will fuel ever say just once you call mother and if you can see I'm sorry immediately the love will come is then he said at died lobstah to di come seeking a refuge at thy feet they again sang of the Divine Mother who mother thou my inner guide ever awake within my heart day and night thou holdest me in thy lap this is the beautiful prayer shall we be Ganon and the recently I read Tommy began Ananda he was telling a devotee the he is to pray like this Oh mother the neighbor ever allow me to get down from your lap please hold me tight with you so that I can be on your lap all the time so this should be the prayer the wind you can imagine a child a baby sitting on the mother's lap how happy the baby is and he not having any problem whatever happening in this all around he is very comfortable because sitting on the mother's lap mother will take care of me so that should be the prayer the master and Brahma devotees sang several songs about Horry and gauranga that is Brahma devotees they are also singing the devotional songs and Salama busines through the song giving the teaching friendly I think we should stop now and we should ponder we should meditate and we should try to understand that what Sudama Krishna is trying to give to us the first and foremost we should be free from the fear of death the fear of death why today or tomorrow it will come so obviously don't be afraid of death but at the same time be very very cautious that powered by a survey tab in till then we should be careful about the problem and should try to avoid the problem as maximum way now the all the doctors and everyone is advising that we should maintain his social separation and social support physical separation but at the same time we should be united and in the modern world it is very much possible through telephone three through many other means we can see to each other we can talk to each other we can have this type of gatherings sitting everywhere individually we can be together so that we should try to follow never ever try to break this rule why not that you are afraid of your death but you were cautious as a citizen that we should not break this and now this this is first part second part how to leave all alone the many people they don't have the habit of leaving alone so obviously they're getting frustrated the socializing and there are some people there are some good people they like to be with their friends and they like to enjoy the society going out and in other weekends so all these things now it is completely stopped and then how to leave how to survive against the ramakrishna stilling try to research your own mind this is the wonderful opportunity try to research the mind now you read a holy book some wonderful don't read these and that only the you know that sometimes most of our time goes away with this type of some people who have not realized anything and some intelligent people they have written some books and we are going on reading what is mind what is date if you like you can do but for me don't waste time with all those things sit quietly close your eyes and try to observe what is going on in your mind and immediately note it down in a notebook what is happening when I close my eyes what are the things that came in my mind I could visualize my frames my club my office my this problem might that problem just note it down then second with that note you see it in a corner or maybe a reading table and then you try to analyze how I can solve this problem and suppose I can't solve this problem what is going to happen to me and if possible minimize those things is it possible so if you go on analyzing then you will find the next session when you are sitting maybe on a chair maybe scratching on the floor that soft floor maybe on the carpet closing your eyes taking a deep breath and thinking that that ear the hot air going down to the spinal cord at the end of the spine the skull mooladhara in sanskrit the root of all and then it is slowly coming out and when it is coming it is also dragging a light and that is becoming a straight line through your spine and from the bottom of the spine at the end on the top of your head is beautiful light that is make make a path try to visualize that and the third stage put your mind at the center of your body that is the heart I just put a finger give a pressure bring the mind at that place and here you imagine I say imagine that there is a big flower if possible the color of the flower is red imagine that red flower and on that red flower the Hindus they always say the Lotus lotus is a symbol of devotion and many of you have seen the Lotus and you can go to the Google search and see that what is Lotus and so many petals slowly opening up and all the petals are nothing but the rate color and the center of that flower there is a carpet small piece of carpet on that if you can imagine any god or goddess sitting and a beautiful light is coming out from that god or god and you are offering food to that god and goddess you are burning incense sticks lighting a candle a lamp and then looking at that the beautiful light slowly is covering your whole body and mind try to forget you at least for a few seconds that's a beautiful way you can control your mind this is called meditation spiritual meditation if you are thinking about the worldly thing you can but the moment you are thinking about the worldly thing whole mind will take the shape of that worldly thing and then after some time the pain will come not joy the pain why because anything that is worldly is going to be destroyed it is temporary that's why see Ramakrishna said don't even be so much attached to the body what is also temporary so think about something which is permanent and what is the ultimate permanent thing then God the God is the ultimate permanent and how to see God if you don't believe in the existence of God no problem you see the light effulgent light at the center of that flower and look at that light try to imagine that light is slowly Oh covering your whole personality or being and you are losing yourself that will do thank you friends thank you devotees we will meet again and I think the next class will be talk about Gita the same way I'll be sitting over here talking to you on the bhagavad-gita it will be the teint chapter the our devotees the Vedanta study circle of
