[173. Panchama Veda 173 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udaSiWSnik0)

let us begin the gospel of Salaam dinner with these wonderful words thomna thomna jeevan KO be rewritten can masha sadhana Mangalam Sri Madhavi Tom Boonen da porra dodging our today we will study a portion from the gospel of the wrong dish 'no page four four four here we find ceramic dish nur is organizing like the retreat that is organized over here and in India they call it partisan manner they had some a lot of devotees in one place and the son Krishna will go there and the person mainly the rich person he will invite the people and they don't be music there will be discussion then afterwards they will feed the people all those things exactly those things that we are practicing you do the same way why because this is called retreat spiritual retreats from we come back from our home from our work players and we then go and mix with all other same minded people discuss about those things and in the presence of a holy person slowly slowly that divinity already within us that manifest that is the whole part and master Marsha the writer of the Gospel he has recorded this it was Sunday June 15 1884 cinema business arrived in the morning at the garden house of Solyndra one of his beloved householder disciples master Michelle with in common he is mentioning a student reverse as a favorite too Salameh Tichenor why it was very simple type of person though he was holding a very high post but still very simple and in the religion cocoon gachi now those who are from being calcutta particularly they will find it difficult to find a village because Kakuna is now is Calcutta only so obviously in those days we can understand the Calcutta it was a small one and now those are from that part they will know that the purpose Arkana that was the area of capital after that is all villages now it has extended tears Salameh Tichenor wind conquer gotcha Surendra had invited him and a large number of the devotees to religious festival as long distance to go and then the morning years gun with Allah devotees and he's very happy occasion like this we're a source of great happiness and rejoicing to the Masters devotees it's not the many people are coming here only the master Mercia is going I mean master is doing Ramakrishna is going and his devotees people whose to like him love and itch to go and then assemble why because one type of thought the same type of thought shouldn't go otherwise a different type of now in this month and this week end we will have the retreat once Rama will come he will give a talk for the three days I'm not going to talk anything I gave my retreat in that tomb then the jewel I another Swami's coming August another chamois and September October like that only singing thought that person is going to give and the devotees will be there studying the book why because that is the complete idea and it goes deep into the mind so this the system Salaam Krishna developed he was then seen at his best service was very happy and so many devotees have come he joined with the others in devotional music and in chanting the name of God frequently green into ecstasy there was a speciality of ceramic dish no he cannot expect it from all the moms of the holy people because see Rama Krishna is the only person in the whole of spiritual history who was actually living and the boundary of this world and the each Wentworth Bob Mookie taco that was the command he received for the Baba Bucca so he was with these worldly people this world and so many things at the same time any moment it could cross the border and go to spirituality that spiritual room which we cannot even think of but that is the spiritual realm and there he could go at any instant any time so that's why the devotees who knew him they used to bring down his mind constantly otherwise it was difficult for him there are musicians were there they were singing the episode in the life of Shri Krishna the Skull Kid in Bengal in those men know that particularly at a time of salamat isne only two different groups of religious practices very strongly to a steer one is Vaishnava another verse chapter so shocked and whenever it was there the tsunami some production nursing it was not there Swami's sannyasins of the pedantic tradition is to come over there at the time of particularly the person's father the mela to that time winter storm is this to come but in general the practice was this to the tantrics and vegetables so heavy well in the whole of gospel require the sea Ramakrishna is singing the Virgin's from the Tantra tradition and sometimes the kilter and mostly to entertains Ramakrishna and the religious devotees Clifton so the people this to come and sing the kilter even today East Bengal the Hindus they are very fond of this gifted children actually is nothing but describing the life of Krishna in a very political and musical way they'll be going on they will take an episode and a this time they basalt it's a Krishna the God God incarnate and rather the foremost of the copies she felt an indescribable longing for union with him Salaam o Krishna like this this longing the desire to meet God and what he said forgetting everything but the other people will think what I will do or not everything needs to forget for the love of God sometimes the young Narendra never liked it he said all these things are nonsense they're doing some if she said no if you even don't like that take that attraction of the rather the pure love for God the longing for God the desire for God and what is God actually purity what is purity unselfishness so God longing for God and all that we say if we now break it it goes to love and unselfishness these are the two things and nothing else now to become completely unselfish is not a matter of job is very very difficult to reach to that height to that level now when we are analyzing the life of Sri Ramachandra the life of Sri Krishna without prejudices some people they keep the tinted glasses and then they are describing or analyzing no that is not look at the qualities the work and that's why for thousands of years Sri Ramachandra Sri Krishna respected by the Indian not great sages not that nowadays are the ordinary people some political people they are utilizing religion for their benefit that is all different so what are the qualities and we will find this to love and unselfishness and love and unselfishness is possible when there is no ego and this time in the modern timer one see Ramakrishna he is giving the message that we are me Molly gucchi vision job in Bengali he said when you can remove the eye the ego all problems are solved so the ceramic isne is talking with when saddam krishna heart assam he suddenly stood up he became speechless his body motionless his eyes have closed his mind totally unconscious of the outer world she was in deep Samadhi we read about Samadhi we have heard about Sumati people nowadays they talk about very big learning about Samadhi and what is Samadhi for getting your own presence that is the body the body associated with the mind and the activities of the mind can anyone control it go beyond that sometimes people be taking some strong medicine the narcotics and they sometimes they forget that isn't the way through meditation consciously you were going beyond is not such an easy thing and Slama businesslike and fine the Swami ji told he is the really best he cannot find this type of character any moment if then he could go beyond the body consciousness there was no iota a small little drop of ego still little ego is there you cannot go beyond the body consciousness the body consciousness the eye consciousness is so strong so deep life after life we are caring because of this eye consciousness because of the ego so sadawa Tichenor the moment ii heart shri radha she's crying to meet Krishna mister apparently they have drawn in that way there is nothing in the bhagavata that there is no Radha only the gaudiya vaishnavas the Bengal which never school they developed the character of Shri Radha and then the picture are as a lady and who is in great difficulty because of the social condition she is married to some another path gentleman the family the family condition even then her love for God unthinkable but the ordinary people they do not understand these they drag it down to the the ordinary level of love it is not like that that was a pure love for God willing so this rather the moments down which the heart about it a little immediately his mind cross the border and went into the realm of spirituality after the long time he became normal consciousness those who are trying to practice meditation genuinely they know how it is difficult to control the mind the mind by nature is so Restless so many things are going on happening thoughts of the thoughts we observe their waves are crossing in the mind we cannot control it may be that we are sitting quietly it doesn't mean that we are not working constantly the mind is going on moving why my country country to that because associated with the body the ceramic Isner then the full two pages master machine giving the details description of the songs that they sang and other the devotees reactions but let us come to this page number four four eight here in the middle we find after the music Salaam Master said with the devotees just then needin general showing that that if you see that other side the right hand side the Ramakrishna and the detention the internal energy this Niren generated and prostrated himself before him at the very Sun is Beloved Disciple the master student cinema Tichenor anyone who is simple and love God the God loves them the Serrano Krishna is God himself he standing up to receive the imagine that the student with beaming eyes and smiling face Salameh he is so happy and see you have gone to the way he's saved that as if a group of people our friends and known people I have gone to some place and suddenly I find someone else over there what reaction I will have oh you are also here so like that that means they are all related the Saddam Edition and the director circles are all related and they have come to show us in different positions they have taken to enact how the devotion should be how the love for God should be the respect for the Guru should be so we find in the niranjan and ceramic is nice telling you see this boy is absolutely kindness writes ramakrishna student and showed so much of joy and love absolutely kindness one cannot be guileless without a great deal of spiritual discipline in previous words in this sentence the ceramic business telling master Masha recorded and coating previous birth and here we find that previous birth is there young man the body accepted by selfishness previous birth and in the previous part also someone has done something good and that is the reason in this life so when they have done something good it is not lost it is there when the Arjuna is asking Shri Krishna what will happen to a person who is trying to realize God in this life but couldn't achieve that total West he could not enjoy the life his world he could not realize that God isn't it that is total waste no Shri Krishna's ain't no it is not like that Arjuna was giving the example the wind the gusty wind is coming and breaking the cows is it like that forcefully taking it somewhere else the soul which was trying to realize God could not achieve the goal and the same soul could not enjoy this world also his total loss no shoot Inari Matangi you compress the Vijaya they immediately the Lord Krishna stealing in the next bird has been a very good family with the very good parents nowadays those who are keeping Dutch a day Indian news you know there is the mother and the case is going on I do not know of course who is guilty and all that the mother because of the name fame money said denounced her own son and daughter not only that they are completing that she is the main cause of killing her own daughter and now the today the son went against her and all these things can you call the mother no just a human life at man body but what is to this one boy and girl to suffer they also did something wrong in the previous birth that's why they got that type of mother and this mother just for heart little bit comfort killed the daughter and tried to declare that his son is a man and and with the help of some corrupt doctors trying to prove that he is in no way matters somehow he saved that boy so after reading this I was thinking uttering the same book so their suffering she is also suffering but why this why they came in like this so obviously one should be happy that I got a very good parent father and a mother like that each and every one looking back and looking at the father and the mother must be very very happy but they give me so much and that's why in Indian tradition they always put it very high respect for mother and the father that just like the father and the mother like the god Ptah sir the Potala dharma PT para multiple tonight that the same and janna new Yamaha mr. Sarkar the big area see there's a much about the Evan we talk about heaven super - what type of Germany the full of love full of affection so this is Ramakrishna stating that you know the last birth they did a lot of good things so they are kindest a hypocritical and calculating mind can never attain God hypocritical and calculating mind Shamim Vivekananda I knees make your days in his he say I can't stand everything but he published it so that's why when he came over here in this country the people are very simple and they always speak the truth I did this type of mistake I did that I did that now do you think I'd be able to realize God from his abs why not so like that but some people they'll be putting different type of marks and covering and showing that they're religious but in reality they are completely different that's why shamans say I can accept anything it except hypocrisy this hypocritical attitude comes because of the slavery the slaves who are working under the Masters you don't like the master but just for the survival they will go on praising the master oh this is the this is their then we'll go on drink I mean India because we are under the subjugation for almost long seven hundred eight hundred years some saying that almost like a thousand years we went there and it just entered into our blood that hypocrisy and he go and talk very nicely but do exactly oppose it think exactly about it what we think we never say what we say we never do that is the hypocrisy we have to come out of that freedom freedom freedom freedom is the song of the soul that is a Swami TC what is that freedom why should it be hypocrite it's not necessary the master said Amma business this is how it grew good teacher very good teacher he's helping the people to develop the spirituality and he's telling don't you see the God incarnates himself only in a family where innocence exists like the dasharatha Nanda and all disease mentioning Lama and Krishna then he said master to him ah how wonderful was the yearning of the gopis for krishna is coming back once again how wonderful was the yearning of the gopis Krishna the ladies and the girls not the group of booming that is Brindavanam they are known as Coppa and go P the gopis the yearning for the Lord Krishna drama business mentioning about it did he say the sum and substance of the whole matter is that a man must love God man must love God is not food is masked said man must love God it that is the sum and the substance of the whole matter that is in the life it should not be anything else but God must love God must be restless for him it doesn't matter whether you believe in God with form or in God without form you may or may not believe that God incarnate himself as man but you will realize him if you have that yearning so that is exactly what the Salama Tichenor is giving the clear idea there is nothing less you have to realize God you must realize God how it is possible realizing the God in this in this way that we find that yearning for God whether God with father God without for God can incarnate or not never so that Islamist I came back after giving the retreat in Vancouver Canada this from there we came I came back on Monday someone I am bother of shaman Vivekananda within half an hour 40 minutes I spoke on that what is the summer nya that is what Sri Ramakrishna dot and Swami Vivekananda propagated practiced and propagated just now some of you have observed the devotion this is other thing was going on the spirit related ritualistic way of worshipping the God that is the bhakti the devotion then many of you were meditating the Diana and now I have come over here and giving the discourse is having the two different type of action one is karma another is practicing of the knowledge when I'm giving the discourse on Tuesday and Sundays and Saturdays and going out that is my Karma because I have accepted this particular life the Miss ministerial job but of course the way we think in the Christian tradition the ministerial job it's not like that the that thing along with sannyas in the monastic life so here we always feel astronomy become the same mother of supreme you should practice spirituality and try to take it to the doors of others Dharmapala Dhara magic shop so devotion meditation contemplation then knowledge and work all the four together that is exactly what Raghavan said our business so he is giving the in that way the inspiration you should beat idleness trustee sale and then he said you must love God and must pray to God insatiable yearning for God I don't know where you are yesterday I was telling them some of the elderly devotees were there in the Vancouver we don't have the customer like that but the devotees have purchased a building and they kept a room where the monks they go from different North America if they go and they can stay I arrange the food to the small room where nearly 30 40 people can accommodate I can assemble they have a shrine over there the kitchen like that so they are giving the donation they are maintaining the building they are contacting the Swami's they are inviting them why because they like to know about it I was thinking to organize as the Indian devotees they organized in a very big way and the island in Andaman nearly 100 25 30 people from different places they all went to Andaman of course we are having some sightseeing at the same time constantly just discussion about the God and meditation so that way because the modern mind constant is not possible but wherever you go which whatever the things that all around put your mind on God on spirituality that helps this time also some of our devotees are trying to organize it they don't know we will surely announce thinking where to go and what to do and anything in America means costly so it will be like that and this type of thing constantly so I always say so all the discussion that you hear is good but afterwards having very good relation with God on the afraid of God and go and talk to mother go and talk to some Krishna how come there you are my father you are my mother because of you only I am here and you are not giving devotion to me what is wrong with me if other people can happen it and advancement in the spiritual life why not me why can't I hear your voice why can't they see you go and cry go and talk to them so that is the best way to realize God the ceramic dish kneeling like now he's that is the speciality of cinema kishna he is to pray to God mother don't make me a dry monk I'm only you sitting like that and sometimes on God are not talking with people very life and behavior not like that he religion means the best thing in the life religion is not something extra religion is the main source of our life if the religion is not giving us the joy then why should we practice religion religion is making people have framed religion is making people to Spain lot of money that is not religion that is only if you like to do you can do but here oh you have come to Temple you must make this sometimes some places they do and making people have free you must have to spend $10,000 for these dues there that is not a religion that so I stopped a college is not a must but once the Lama business come to reestablish data what is that Dharma love and unselfishness and how to integrate these two wonderful qualities which is there already within us how do you forget again and again you have to go and listen to the holy talks of the holy people who are those who are leaving that particular life not that some people they are very good in formulating the sentences they have the tremendous command and the language and they can speak not like that you have to see the character and then only you have to believe their words we see cinema business character we see this host of spiritual people and then we believe them and here he finds dhamma krishna so simple he was talking the high spiritual thing certainly isn't reading so I don't see anybody's calling for food we have come here now we are discussing about the spirituality but what about the food he is talking like that if you talk like that some people who say what type of religious person is they is talking about food only eating no you should not speak like that that is not the ceramic Krishna way so now Krishna is just normal the religious life is very very normal Sadam acacia trees visiting the devotees house in currying about their family and then and pricing them you should do like this we should do like that there's a total development total development I don't care what you were doing how you were earning money and what is your suffering and all I don't care about that only come and be like this no that is hypocrisy the life should be complete the total cinema business inquiring and he said I said Rama who is the manager of the feast he is looking after everything superintending everything history and ceremonies or ROM he is the manager then we know what we expect you know the Rambabu meals a little bit of that he'll be having these and that like I just like us we know some person and we make jokes with that oh he's there oh my god then it will be difficult to find things so that really only Snapfish none the God in human form just having that fun and very shrewd ingre he is asking about to register actually resident of surrender but rom that he was also a very rich man he was a doctor he was also having and the big place now that Ram Chandra doctor is given to the ramakrishna mission and that particular place is known as cocoon gachi you would dawn as because ceramic is not say this is the place where meditation will very good - you got Donna now ceramic is not immediately changing the topic and asking to three more master Marche he went to visit a holy man he went to Paragon dollars here is a now a devotee insane very famous for one gosh he went to Paragon - what sort of man is he he's inquiring he is very old now I saw him at karna kala is little away from Calcutta is another district karna he can hear only if one speaks loudly into the year hearing me mention your name he said that vagabond are was a devotee of the bush Naga Saint he said you have nothing to worry about us because he had come in the fall of Salama Krishna said of avant-garde cinema Krishna - worship goddess Kali people is to know that is a tantric but it's very difficult to say whether he was a tantric or not he worshipped the Rama he worship Krishna she worshipped Kali and then he practiced the Vedanta so you cannot just mark that he was this and there but sometimes people is to say like that but other than the saintly just in Mahima children arrived now it is a little description about the money module and there's a separate book about disturbed people who associated with Ramakrishna the who they exit the Mahima channel was a rich man he was not doing any job but used to study a lot he started the Sanskrit and English and of course bengali in those days it was very difficult to find Bengali books and Swami Vivekananda's brother minder not that he mentioned in those days Bible was very easy to gain because these to distribute Bible but we never find any books you know friends Ramakrishna mission it has done a great job but so many of unreal subtitles they have printed in so many languages almost all the languages of ring India and including English so and then it has distributed in the Maharashtra there is a publication section they are publishing the books on that regional languages and also in Hindi there is a Hindi publication and there is a Bengali publication the English public hundreds and hundreds of varieties of titles and books and magazines all over now so that is the best contribution in the spiritual world by the ramakrishna mission Swami's there are so many Swami's are there constantly pouring into that researching writing books writing articles publishing it is so difficult to publish now others it is very easy of course in the computer but I was there in a publishing house I news is so difficult that they used to publish and you will wonder that Swami Vivekananda static disciples how things to collect the information about Swami Vivekananda they published advertisement over here in America and Europe if anyone is having any information please send it to us the collected is edited it and then they printed and how the printed still that praised the machine is there in morality if you go you can find the moms this to compose and then they should print it in those days if you're going you can stand how difficult it was but used to do and apart from that the great personalities Souls like very sure Ananda Jeeva Raja they should carry books on their ears on a particular place in Calcutta that's called the college street many colleges are there in this on the same street so college street and that is the place where people they go to purchase books he's to go and spread the books over there to sell can you imagine and this is the way and we always say to our devotees we win even you are giving the gift to different location you are giving the gift give we will boot also you were sending the flowers we booked along with their you were giving something else give a book along with that that will help the people the one or two words of Lama Vivekananda can change the whole life so that Saddam Oh Krishna is telling there in the Mahima Tarun came he used to study and sadhana Krishna look at it how he's joking its master - my mother and what is this I see his skin shape here all laughing The Scream ship miss big boat is coming we expect here a small boat at the most but the real steam ship has arrived that means a person with great knowledge etc etcetera that he is mentioning and then is Ramakrishna he is conversing with the Mahajan she asked him isn't it isn't feeding people a kind of service to God a new concept cinema history is introducing feeding people service to God it was not accepted in those days in our tradition see Ramakrishna is introducing it and Shami pavillon de came like a flower he whoever is serving the poor the downtrodden the illiterate serving the Living God he declared and educated young people they came and dedicated their lives for the service of the people who were suffering all over the Ramakrishna mission now is very famous for this now almost all the denominations of the Hindu the six the amar practicing different shots of services but the introduction the introduction of that particular service in de as we are serving the God worshiping the God in living being see how it is introduced we find here he is talking with the Mahajan in the form of a question my Mandarin is a traditional Hindu only read books and eat the proper way don't touch any one of these that all the sorts of things that entered into the Hindu spiritual body ceramic is breaking it his Ling isn't feeding people a kind of service to God this is a good thing or not other model thing no service to God God exists in all being as fire service giving the heat of the phoenicians in the catawba nished also it says how God created this universe and then entered into this universe like the fire entered into the woods so that ceramic is not gave that hint of the upanishadic statement he is telling the god exists in all being as fire and the fire means here he made the hunger and when we are offering food we are offering food to that hunger and if we can imagine that it is the yoga power fire the fire of the pure holy Indian as we give the ablation we are putting it into that and when we are giving the food to the poor man suffering the poor man he is eating getting satisfied today I received some of the pictures from over Bangladesh centre and in that Bangladesh the bar deity that is the name the one Swami ji he was a friend so he's something a lot many young small small kids they are getting education new clothings food and all that they are trying in Bangladesh it is so difficult to get money who will give them donation somehow they are collecting and he has written a letter to me expecting maybe he never mentioned they can you please send some money he only he just sent the reporting but this way he's they are all doing why only if we remember a hungry man the moment taking a morsel of food in the mouth and that goes as an offering to the fire I really feel the modern Hindu society should understand these so they are constantly offering things in the fire so many millions of dollars they're spending in the fire burning just in a field the one lady was today she rang and she was telling a group of people have come from India Government of India has sent them another now this government is trying to spread Hinduism so they are coming on behalf of the government and they like to teach the young can over here but they can't speak English so can you organize the play some people who understand Hindi exit well I don't know anyway so that is the still they are thinking in that way tradition we having the young pouring the oblation nothing wrong idiot but look back and see thousands of suffering while in India look at the world and in the ethiopia and so many places people are suffering if you can feed one that'll be the gradient that is the neon Buganda that is the new Hinduism ceramic is reintroducing and that is why Shama Vivekananda offering pranaam to him say stop gaya to Terabithia his stablishing the Dharma the modern Hindu should understand this isn't feeding people a kind of sophistica God exists in all beings to feed people is to offer oblation to the indwelling spirit then he said but then one should not read the weekend I mean people who are entangling grass go worldliness all who have committed heinous crimes so one must be very very careful even the ground where such people sit becomes impure once three days there is this relative he was also as to serve the roundish 'no fade a number of people a good many of them where we get I said to read a look here if you feed such people I shall leave your house at once you should not make people Biggers in our country in the name of this spirituality many of the rich people they will be offering food and unnecessarily the people will come and take food and light down and lighting the time because they know more morning time the food is their evening time will go and take food over there they won't work that is worst we should not ask them to depend on us rather help them but those who write this moment cannot earn anything helping them so one must be very very careful in helping people how he is going to use that money that is also one must be careful the good many of them where wicked I said before coming to America five years before I went to Kashi someone gave me 1000 rupees in $10 bill generous not and I was distributing among the poor people and when he saw I was distributing suddenly she noticed a person in Kashi he's a cab driver he saw that I am distributing $10 notes he just stopped the car came out and you know that shabby trace and uncombed here he also said and within the line and no one can identify with her he said cab driver or a bigger because the trace and behavior but I noticed that man and when I came I didn't give them money I gave to next men then show me gee what about me then I told see these people have no other place but only this much so they have come down on the roads that is the last stage of human life don't be here you can drive a cab you can earn money leave at higher and Li properly rather you should have these people while you are begging begging is not a good profession in that way so immediately his attitude changed he got up with some confidence he offered pranaam and he went and drove back the car so like that we have to understand whom to and who not Ramakrishna is also telling like this and see Ramakrishna and devotees got the food they enjoyed the middle and afterwards he rested a while about two o'clock in the afternoon Pratap Chandra Majumdar of the Brahmo Samaj arrived those who are connected into Ramakrishna the literature you know Pratap chandram agenda was a leading person in the Brahmo Samaj and he was a framed Coshocton regime he came here and from the same tyres in Chicago they he also gave her talk about Brahmo Samaj Shami be wakened gave the talk about Hinduism he was a co-worker of tea shop Chandra had been in Europe and America he greeted ceramic Tichenor and the master to bow before him with his usual modesty Masterman said no take this cinema she was very humble so whenever anyone is coming and offering banana you also in return is to say majority of the moms they will never do this if you go to the Uttarakhand and other places the method is the same they will never do like that like the king they will be sitting over there and maximum they can raise their I turn in the position of the posture of blessing but Salaam addition is teaching us we are not different all all of us are going to the same God so I only is taking this particular life renouncing the life and going towards God and he were living in the household processing towards the God so why not I should also be very humble so that is why and the God is in every being when someone is offering Namaskar to you you should all say to do that because you were not offering Namaskar to that particular person it is the God in dwelling in that they began to talk about Asia the main purpose of his life was to introduce religion among householders so they were talking then pratap gender Matilde mentioned about lady who came to Europe and she could speak in English educated lady but afterwards she converted herself into Christianity sharing the Islamic agency I don't know how but from what you say it seems to me that she has a desire for name and fame that this is called discrimination we have to understand what is the purpose of my life I have left my heart and home and everything now shall I hanker for name and fame some clapping's of the people one should be very very careful so that Saddam Oh Krishna mentioning to know this is must be some desire was there for name and fame that kind of egotism is not good that feeling I am the tour is the outcome of ignorance but the feeling that God does everything is due to knowledge humbleness will come I have done this this is my achievement if one is thinking in that way in the spiritual life you cannot make the progress in the material life of course it is necessary to say but in the spiritual life never even if the see like that they cannot make any progress God alone is the doer all others are mere instruments in his hands we have seen them this teaching that manifested in the life of Xiaomi PB can endure when thousands of people they were dragging his chariot and they were shouting the glory to be waken under he immediately requested them not to select that and he said the person who made me Vivekananda can do like me hundreds from the dust of this road he's so powerful the God himself I did nothing injury that is called humbleness I have not done anything God is doing so this consciousness constantly that gives a wonderful turn in the character and what comes I have done my responsibility as a father as a mother as a teacher as a guru whatever I am supposed to do is a spiritual person I have done my duty whatever was given to me in to the best of my capacity I have done some people will do it much better way some people will be little less doesn't matter to my capacity I have done I've tried my best and I am satisfied one gentleman was telling if I write a biography of his own biography I will give the name the book no regrets it's a good name he has chosen but I read in the microwave anyway he has only thought about the name but it means so this no regrets means what he would have done I'm satisfied why God gave me the power give me the thought brought some people brought some money and all those things came in such a way I could do that and I'm happy he has chosen me mimic the mantra of a suppressor gene in the bhagavad-gita say Krishna is asking a personality like Arjuna just become the instrument in the hand of God that is worth some business daily then one devotee is asking a very very important question how can a man get rid of his ego friends devotees I think in our next class we will discuss about this important topic ego is the main problem because of the ego we cannot realize garden because of the ego we suffer all suffering because of the ego I am so-and-so I have done reason there and this is not coming all because of the ego up to it etiquette that eco Ramakrishna's teaching will listen in our next class stop what here you know that 27 28 29 the end of this of the week we came to go to Ganges if you like to come you can come and join over there also let us conclude this with this mantra need indeed the under dr. kanta Drita be conveyed ich Avatara Purusha medium Ramakrishnan she Rosanna Monty Chandi Chandi ready he'll that said shridhama Krishna's are bananas
