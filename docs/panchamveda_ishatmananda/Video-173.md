[174: Panchama Veda 174 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n3Z8JKNiMo)

good evening let us began begin this sloka Takahama rhythm even written calm masha ravana Mangalam Mangalam booby greed indeed Raja nama commercial commercial means the sink what they have seen actually we commit what we actually do whatever we do with a attitude of high consciousness the ego that is karma shot that is seen why see because that violence and what happens many times we have to come back once again in this life don't think that all the time in the human birth in different birth so that it goes in this way to go beyond this there are so many types of suffering so many times and from to go beyond that what is the only way that Saddam Edition is mentioning we will come to note that circle masha allah masha the scene it's slowly Greenaway how by listening the advices of this so particularly here but once around Krishna how he is removing that beginning as the teaching some of the secrets some of the system that we should further if we follow that we are free from that so we will follow up what Saddam addition is still and we will continue the conversation that ceramic Krishna was having with the devotees we really thank master Naja the person will know tenor of this conversation and so minutely everything he noted we go to some place we listen to that then we forget or in mix-up many other things but here the master Hacha he was noting down everything that the person is asking in the salon business replying and afterwards he was again checking it with other people sometimes with ceramic dish to yourself so the authority that is very excellent over here and we can completely believe what's wrong business thing what is there in the gospel of drama business is perfectly correct majority of the book we do not know the Tripitaka it was much much afterwards then the Lord would and similarly the others so the every crime the gentleman the devotee he is asking us because cinema Tichenor raised the point ego ego is the problem ego is the source of all trouble so he is asking how can a man get rid of his ego now ceramic is nice giving the answer you cannot get read or field the ego until you have realized God is a page 451 the Gospel of Saddam Krishna he said you cannot get rid of ego until you realize God the only possible way to eradicate ego is God realization and exactly the other way if you have the ego you cannot realize God and if you really skirt then only ego will go so we have heard in the scepter so how do you move think of that Saddam addition I will tell so you cannot get rid of these and it is so sucky way it comes very subtle way sometimes some people are very humble that is there you go so I am so humble you see nobody can be so humble like me he example not fighting with anyone not raising his voice but at the same time is very much proud that I am so humbled and people are appreciating my this humbleness what is all see so how to understand is very very difficult and only way as Ramakrishna is telling that you have to we will come to that if you find that the gentleman is asking again if you find a person free from legal they know for certain that he has seen God if you find a person free from ego then know for certain that he has realized God that's very clearly his mentioning when you were free from ego he realized God and that's why he said army morning achieve a general in Bengali see the green eye that ego is removed all the problem of the life is so in the garlic scallion job and that means all these trashes what is the trash dress is this ego now what is this I this is a very peculiar thing we will discuss that so unless we really scored it on goal and unless we remove it we only allege God so that is a very peculiar situation then the gentleman is asking said what are the science of God region how you will know that this person has realized God what are the signs in cinema business telling him he is giving many in here I have mentioned inaudible he said the man who has seen God becomes like a child why child don't think the child lived on can understand it he is moving here and yet not like that he mentioned the child because the child is beyond three gunas these three gunas are sweater Raja and tomorrow the combination of all these that we see is nothing but the common tree gunas sattva Raja and Amma some people they're going to meet a holy person it is a great crowd all night they're waiting over there and here in a queue then in the line the only they will go and see the holy man wait he is also person these people who are believed they are also people human being why one human being go to another human being dead we have to understand what is the difference sometimes some people they are very good in music or die's and that Timonium but about a religious man what is there he cannot sing he cannot down signal or money he cannot do anything even then people giving you so much of respect maximum respect that the religious person is having why because he's beyond three gunas sattva Raja and Dhamma and how you will know that we are three gunas Thomaston stealing was not bound by these qualities sector Roger and Dhamma now it will come dust the ego disappear altogether after the realization of God really this pre-processing in Assyria it says if we are trying to serve the person holy man you have to ask very pertinent questions or E+ not many other things you can give but the holy man is always happy when you are asking some spiritual questions and listening to your question hearing your question even understand how much standard you have come body pristine and safe way up you can serve the holy man through questions so here does the ego disappear all together after the realization of God he is asking in reply see Ramakrishna stating yes sometimes God totally he faces the ego of his devotees now we have to note this particular point I am striving to eradicate my ego and then cinema distance stealing sometimes God totally effaces the ego of his devotees that means without the blessings of God is not possible and that's why it says when there is no ego you can see God and unless you see God there is no chance of going away or free from the ego so that is possible the God is blessing how God's blessings will come help will come free power this free power again explained as you have to strive cleveland's action and ah miss achieve and you have to strive you have to try to do then only he will achieve and otherwise not when his baby is placed on Tisha has given this example again and again when the baby is playing happily mother will look at the baby and then she goes away to some other place twerk and won't take any care of the baby but the wind the baby is crying the mother knows that she wants me now otherwise the mother won't come either Bible we find that Jesus is telling knock the door it will be open unto you if we just go and stand before the let God open if it will never be open so the slide we are trying when we are trying the only the blessings of God will come they say if you go one step towards God he will come ten steps towards you the devotional way they say to mix up with the knowledge knowledge is a different approach but in the devotion in the bhakti he says that if you are going one step towards God and say God I don't know you but you know me I don't know how to call you how to realize you how to see you and what will happen after seeing you but I'm curious please come by dad to you also it says in different scriptures it is possible why because he's within the heart whatever the thought is coming you endure to shout sometimes some people they'll be using the microphone to call the car it's not necessary disturbing everyone will be shouting but God is not Dave why you need you to pronounce even your Tod that will reach to God if you're thinking within your heart because he's within the heart and that is the reasons Ramakrishna is telling that God knew affairs the ego of the devotee as in the state of Samadhi when the Samadhi state goes the tranquility of the mind what is mine all thoughts how the thoughts come because of the ego I should do this I should not do this I have to do it and all that egocentric ego-centered things are coming that is the talk if there is no ego there is no thought and wind is not there what will happen tranquility and that tranquility is called Samadhi but in many cases now second sentence is a part in many cases he keeps a trace of ego but that doesn't injure anybody Shami Vivekananda here is to the Somali and when it is to that Samadhi the naturally there was no trace of ego and he came to to his gurus Ramakrishna then cinema Krishna who never knew that he is meditating and his to that point immediately declared now you are satisfied you were so much praying for the Samadhi we have realized that Samadhi that is the experience but you have to do my work now the key is with me I won't give it to you until you work for me so he kept the ego in Swami Vivekananda why I have to do I must do and he's thinking that the betterment of the all people not for himself not for name and fame I have to go to America I had to make that Indian people aware about the treasure that they are having and to give them back their self-confidence all these thoughts started rising within Shanti be waken up and he came over here and he said I hide the Son of God this I is not the smaller is a big garden and soon nice way he said people will think that is a problem I have a message to the West as book the heard a message to the East can imagine the way 30 32 years the other man is tilling like that I had a message to the West as the Buddha had a message to the east what is that message Mukti liberation but until gave it to the east and I will give it to the West to death is it ego of course but how that ego feed neighbor binds why because God has kept it and that person when you went to Amman not when he sought saw the Sheba immediately realized his own nature he understood that she woke up she and from then that day onwards he became so humble not me not me not me so there's face down distance telling he keeps a trace of ego Lord Jesus is telling leave everything and follow me that mean is not the eagle it is this the holiness that's manifesting through him so we may understand these we can understand a child he is going and holding this is my mother this is my mother this is my thing this is these he won't leave and very actively is doing so the tongue and Raja these two qualities are so prominent in him and next moment we need leaves he leaves everything and goes away yesterday one with him I think one or two one years old that boy came and he was I wanted to take this thing and that thing he won't gave then a left issue and after that he never wore that shoe you enter it his mother came to such but the and for the shoe he was so much no no this is my shoe I won't give but after it immediately in there is remembering this shot occurs no attachment at all this is mine this is mine and then immediately he lives so subtle Raja and Tama these three beyond three gunas and he is telling like this if I be road child no doubt see re but that ego doesn't harm anybody and similarly these religious people when they say I is not harming anybody Salwa Thurman but integer mam ekam saranam budget in the Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita mom re I didn't do you think the Krishna was interesting person not at all no attachment that is what Sonam equation is telling so friends will come to the discussion that in between senado krishna is talking with pratap gender hustla many of you who knows the history in the protection Raja sorry to touch children Majumdar matters pratap gender Majumdar he was a very learning person very highly educated person he was the representative of the Brahmo Samaj over here in the same meeting where Vivekananda also spoke he came in the 1893 problem to religion but before that he went to London and all that so Salam o Krishna is talking with him he came to visit Ramakrishna selamat is not to Pratap you have been to England tell us what you saw there now the proton is telling the English people worship what is called gold could please the money and all that you oh of course there are also some good people in England those who leave an unattached life but generally one finds there a great display of edges in everything I saw the same thing in America now you see he has visited England and America and Saddam Desna the maximum he only went to Kashi to bring the other self but the moment Pratap said like that but our children Majumdar Sri Ramakrishna say it is not in England alone that one sees attachment to worldly things this is called wiseness it's not that I have to go and I have to read and then only the knowledge will guns it is already the Constitution is very clear because attachment to everything some people are attached to very costly master discard and some people are very much attached to a very small little bag that in his world is attachment it's not these and their attachment is to say this Ramakrishna selling it is not England alone that once is attachment to world things you see everywhere but remember that what is only the fasting in spiritual life so those who are interested in spiritual life work is the fasting everybody is working good that means everybody is going towards the spirituality developing spirituality no God cannot be realized without sattva love discrimination kindness and so on these are the good qualities of the software it is very nature of Rajas to involve a man in many worldly activities that is why Rajas degenerates into Thomas if a man isn't angling too many activities he surely forgets God but it is not possible for you to give a work or to give it your very nature will lead you to eat whether you like it or not therefore the scripture asked you to work in a detached spirit that is to say not to grieve the works reserved for example you may perform devotion and worship and practices charities but your aim is not to harm people recognition or to increase your mate to work in such a spirit of detachment is known as Karma Yoga so in one line is explaining about the Karma Yoga and you know nearly few thousand years before shri krishna another incarnation of god he too gave the same message and that was in special the book that we read every into they keep that one copy of the book is there in every in the family this is bhagavad-gita and there in the third chapter you know the first chapter Arjuna's despondency he is confused so he is asking question what should I do in second that is Balaban is giving that complete idea about the self and the body two different things so don't think that when you are killing someone like that like that you in the TARDIS aim to develop that knowledge you have to work the third chapter complete third chapter is dedicated to karma yoga and here's long distance living that you have to understand that otherwise you only able to realize God and we find this way in the bhagavad-gita and the fifth slow curve third chapter as Saddam Odysseus mentioning saying we the Krishna also said nah he questioned Sharna bobbi-jo to teach that a karma great curse chilled-sama be even for a moment one cannot remain without any work not the physical work mental work you will see that some one people the moment you are talking this okay the moment they are not immediately plugging the year and listening nowadays it has become so much will be going on listening or talking so I am busy if there is no business he is driving but still if is no there's not that activity he is driving but even then he will be dick seeing and listening and all these things we go on why because of the nature of the mind no one can ever demean for a moment without performing any action why because nature compel everyone to act prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah the nature is provoking you completing you forcing you to work the basic of creation is nature now let us discuss this point a little what is this nature in sanskrit we call it property what is the progress e is maya in different names is a maya or property and what is that is a power of God why he that power of God is binding us he does God wanted to create this universe and in the universe his everybody is knowing the time God nature is not good place so he himself created this how separating his power and giving as if the authority to that power to create and so that he can enjoy God except God there is nothing he is creating this universe how he is creating separating his power and what is that power it has been turned as Maya Shakti a made ye that Maya Shakti is also known as property and this property of the Maya Shetty what is their special three different qualities Sirte Raja and on and the Saturday giant among his calmness active and doubtless the shutter is calmness Tama is darkness both are almost similar and someone is simply quietly they will closing his eyes sitting oh what a wonderful person meditating no he's sleeping so the Dhamma and the sucked were almost like sing such thick person never bother about keeping the things in the proper way or maintaining his body because he's constantly thinking of God and shaving and all these things he never cares and punishing also the same way dirty and we'll never do anything and if you make a mistake oh he is also socialized subject in that is the mistake you are doing so subtle and Dhamma almost like the same apparently but main difference Thomas II is very much attached to everything and SWAT thing completely detached with everything these are the two and then we can say in the deep darkness we cannot see anything and in a tremendous light we cannot see anything so both are almost like singing bird is light and darkness so subtle and Dhamma these are the three two qualities of God in between years even a mr. active a mistress to some extent is something into some extreme Raja see a dancing this - mixture not fifty-fifty sometimes it goes up and down that is the Roger maximum that we see our circle rajaguru Raja means it's good that we are in the second stage and from Raja we have to go to subtle so once again the property from where the grecian has come is a power of God this property is having three qualities such as Raja and Tamil when these three qualities are equilibrium no action takes place that is called completely now that without creation pralaya so when it is not creating anything now it is possible because these three gunas are not active at all and when the Lord makes them active what happens sometimes the trauma sometimes the Raja have you noticed in the whole world of the trauma is going up everywhere all people are showing the acoustic way I am going to fight either to do design god forbid because these people they are not ordinary people they're the head of the other states and because of the ego that ego concrete comes that the millions and millions people in suffer because of that again everything will be gone all people will be decided and simple no no no no we have friends you should not try again different type of organization will develop like the UNESCO and all that we should sit together and discuss in little time why this do we had added enough in the first world world people didn't learn then the second world war the first region was too much the in return and then the again we are preparing for the turban everybody is flexing their mouth muscles and telling well we will see do you think we are no you can also see what you can do you can do only destroy and do you think when you are destroying others you will be safe No so this way why it is larger tremendous activities why Raja ego and that is why in our country all these people particularly the whole life of Shri Krishna was dedicated to train the teams he never wanted to Train any other because the Kings those who are leading the whole society they should be struck thick then only all other people can live happily so he said the cetera Roger and Dom on Sutter is asuka they refined happiness in the morning when you meditate and there is nothing all right everywhere and for one hour in the beginning this little struggle and then in the game but in middle at least in 15 minutes when the mind is completely calm when you get a fresh that's suka that is happiness and that happiness comes from software because we were not getting anything from anyone you are not listening anything you are not doing anything the calm mind gives you so much of happiness welcome it comes from the source what is the source it is God and then we can see completely in a scientific way that God is the source of happiness so that is it's an animal Ivica do imani bhutani jayante from this source is the one under that joy the happiness and welcome it comes within us even our mind is tranquil so this three calmness activity and dullness but it gives suka to cut and mr. su can do it combines in the Roger sometimes some people will clap you know one of our devotees recorded my voice the song I'm not single at all just before slamming god racing and then another devotee took that song I sang just all alone without any music and then the they took it and now it is things have developed so much they have even that apply and many other new strains into that song he will never imagine that I sang in a totally separate in a different place and these people are sitting far away in India and that they have given the music and that was given to some devotee now they're spreading it every day I am receiving so many from eg good singer got some and we I am reading that man I am also slowly getting contains we have a good singer no ma'am not so that way if you want today the people will be good like that it goes so well from that asuka King because people are appreciated and suppose after hearing that music the people say oh please don't try the song you tried something else then what will happen I know they doesn't know what is song it is a I will be very angry so everything depends on our mind so what should be our goal to go beyond this tree what will happen you are not at all acting with the activity of other people you're not reacting I should say with the reaction of the people when you are free from that reaction what happens your mind is constantly tempted if somebody is praising we are happy if somebody is not praising we are angry that means what we're actually depending on others be your own master I want to be happy now I'm happy like that you'll have to control your mind how it is possible to occur that is misery suffering so one should strive to go to Raja miss okay little suffering and also happiness it goes pejorative to people they go to that in that samsara in the family life the mother suffered endured maybe the husband it was not very good and the life was very very difficult even then when hard son rule should be so eagerly trying to get him and again once again again a problem will come again people but we cannot go beyond this because we see this is the whole samsara the you know that being a mom will mix with so many different type of people one young boys to come and tell me Sammy I don't too many I know I am the only son of my mother and she's having no one even ready any lady if she comes then with hard one if the mother and that my wife is not going together then what will happen to me I cannot leave my wife I cannot leave my mother so I decided not to many to serve my mother and mother came and cried oh this boy accept you as his guru whatever he will say he will do please ask him to many I could say I am a monk I cannot say that you go and marry I don't believe in that but anyway one thing I'd like to ask you suppose his wife is not listening to you she wants to go in in order to be and the son and the wife will go and start leaving some other place will you be happy or who uses is it but after the man she herself found the lady married and within a month or so later started coming to me sharmaji my mother is crying and doing these and that was ready to actually don't know so now we had to adjust and this is God of life we create our own problem not that we should not matter we have to understand with now we should not start the family we should understand anything may happen and whatever happens I am going to be happy okay I have my son if he is married if the wife comes not accepting me doesn't matter that should have been attitude of the model then the whole family would feel very happy so like this so many practical problem comes in our life and we are in a mixed way Raja frames we have to go beyond that we have to cross the Aegean go to happiness software and how to reach over there now comes the instruction you must have to do that through work only through work it is possible it is not possible for you to give up the work to all together probably kriyamanani because the nature will force you to do and what is the prakruti power of God and Who am I only the manifestation of that nature I cannot go beyond that what I will do so this way we have to understand now the policy we have cleared out and what is that Karma Yoga the God is there he has given as all these and the God came in the form of Shri Krishna thousand thousand years before and he said karma yoga and what is that karma yoga don't do for action but don't wait for the result without attachment government leave our dakara stigma for lazy girl Arjuna in Sanskrit in the bhagavad-gita Shri Krishna stating I don't know whether he spoke in Sanskrit or not but it is written in Sanskrit come on Neal are the cards they only you have the right to perform work monthly issue could Archana but you know the Sanskrit was the common language in those days that was only language afterwards different type of languages came but the only languages and there is no doubt that is 14 Sanskrit verses joking so this this way only that he is telling you have the right to work why because nature reports it work but if you don't wait for the result if you don't hanker for the result then what will happen karma won't be able to bind you the action has a very peculiar with a certain way it will bind you and you won't see the rope how it is binding you but the Rope is very very strong so only thing is possible to follow the words their advices of the grave soul like Krishna and Rama Krishna and Swami Vivekanand that is the reason is same each soul is potentially divine that that is medalta each soul is potentially he sees them now you are telling that is only Hindus not telling only the human being each so we were very very whatever form but initially divine it is not completely manifested but the potentiality is there it can manifest like a seed but the tree is there present in the seed but when you see the tree and the seed what is the difference manifested and potential that's all so the potentiality when - when I see the God when I see the Lord Jesus when I see the Lord Buddha we go and bow down and do what because they manifested and where my potential is like the student and the teacher the students usually in our also just to go and bow down to our teachers whenever the teacher is entering into the classroom used to gator namaste like that you used to do a greeting him and any special occasion is to go and touch his feet why we are also teachers but potentially so that potentiality slowly manifested with the help of the teacher so the Guru is so much respected highly respected so here he said each soul is potentially divine then he sees the goal of the human being not about the others only about the human being the goal is to manage the divinity we mean the divinity within it is there already how the third Stevie says by controlling nature external and internal the externally and internally what is the internal nature desire what is the external nature cyka cyka happiness and misery so the external nature a happiness and misery an internal nature desired if there is no D said there is no happiness or any misery and someone told sharmaji I will bring you some good tasty food and I am waiting waiting waiting expecting that artistic who will come now honestly they brought a tested for them not for me so I took one spoon home and this would taste but I cannot be so that way what happened the even expecting a good food will come and then you are waiting it did came but you could not enjoy us because you were expecting your suffering you know it's no problem bring it if you don't bring there's also case if you don't mind I have seen this great qualities in herpetology the American comedy I've seen whatever you give somebody today this good food has no good then he is happy if there is nothing you take to break and then you put this and that is happy all the time anything that you ask is happy that's a great sign of spirituality it's not so easy particularly this done this taste it makes a human being bad but for him everything is okay no problem if nothing is there only whatever Chiefs that he is happy then no problem only thing that he likes there is a black coffee from early morning to who did it 90 will be going on drinking the black coffee not only to three sips and thank you again you sometimes I threw it because they prefer freshman why this one but he likes it but anyway that is only one thing slow indeed develops the detachment detachment detachment and quite controlling nature what is the teacher protecting what is the priority the heart of God and who is controlling him me Who am I God myself so that is the secret of karma yoga I am NOT begging anything I am the Lord and I am controlling my own nature and I was playing with the danger and now I was found in the nature now I have understood I am going back you may remember the beautiful story that Bhagavad Saddam occasional told that those who have prayed the Saddam additionals book the parables of Saddam additional please go through that book beautiful so the beautiful stories children they read and that gives the highest teaching the one the line has came to hunt for the food in a heart of the ships and all and then give the birth of that baby lion and died and the lion grew up into death among that are and he started learning that little the lion started eating the grasses following the others and then bleating following the others and behaving just like a shield another lion when this line became grew up another lion came he wanted to have his food from that har but they then he saw the lion sir oh my god and the lion is there and he's being equally peculiarly so he went and holding my why you were bring like this now I am a sheep I am afraid please leave me why you're eating the grasses I wish you were you were bleating I wish if they need to keep calm with me and he showed him his own face in a clean water and and look at your face we have seen we are the king of this whole jungle little riders with the Lions why would we even like this role like me don't bleed role like me at that is cool guru takes and says why why are you behaving like this here at the god prakruti the nature the substratum your own qualities just say hey now I am going beyond his authority Tama no action you listen to you they should listen to you when you sit for meditation don't be just command your mind now mine no activity that is the way pedantic meditation commanding the mind because mind is myself when I am NOT not the servant of the mind and sadhana Tichenor say how it is possible through action what is that action Karma Yoga what is that Karma Yoga I will do the work through devotion but with detachment when I am doing the world performing the word work and 100% concentrated and doing everything as minutely as possible as perfectly as possible friends you know that one Shami is coming to keep the retreat this time is a very famous speaker and every time we send out a pure people please come to retreat please come to retreat now this time also we are sending out the later to everyone please don't come please don't come because we have covered with capacity we cannot accept anyone and it already to give power that money and all are known of thank come in the nest so this is the way last few days burden to myself and other devotees we are all working so much you know the human being they give the money in the month of May or before that now they are cancelling and asking to send back the return app so many things are going on same name total confusion and registered with the wife now the wife is not coming and he never met in from that Indian people wife is not going this AHA oh my god surely for you and we are in great trouble and to the only old day we had to work and to me because over there there should not be any confusion and our capacity is very limited many people they are coming I know then we again will come or this is not there that it's not there because our hardly we can accommodate 93 people but we get only maximum 885 we can control that now it is hundred seventy so this perfection I begin and again giving pressure on our volunteers now you have to do this you must do in this oh why because I know that this is our work and those who are coming to attend the retreat they're great people they're coming being and driving for a long a way and only to listen to in philosophy these our guests not ordinary people so we should serve them in such a way that should each and everyone should be happy and that is karma you they are coming for camera but we are there performing karmayoga what is that Karma you making all these things and then telling God we tried our best but still some people are not happy we are sorry we cannot do anything so that is called Karma Yoga why we should control our property our mind making the mind still then why the mind is disturbed because of the ego I and mine how do we dedicate ego now through world but with detachment work with devotion but with detachment even reach the goal the god realization is nothing but controlling your ego isn't it the surround is nestling in conclusion we can say we can realize God if we don't have the ego and ego can be completely erased when idealized God now this is tough to solve this now the only way to work insufficiently without hankering for the result complete detachment whatever we do we must be devoted to the work under person devotion but completely did to be when he did the help then we get the realization of God when we get the realization of God then there is no ego when there is no ego what remains God's quality what's the gods quality joy happiness same sightedness all-powerful everything Salameh Tichenor was having he showed everything in his life that Royce Ramakrishna is considered as the best personality in the modern age he's not in the book but displayed in his life and he displayed in his life that he married he was having a while he was maintaining a family but at the same time completely detached he was having so many disciples but completely detached he was going to each and every place mixed in with people in the society but completely detached she was inspiring hundreds of people to follow the path of religion but at the same time completely detached he showed in his own life that karma yoga and then after that what do you find we just you become like a child without subtle Raja Dhamma we have to go beyond these three Thank You friends thank you for coming this evening in our next week you will again study this gospel of Salaam additional now let us conclude it is wonderful girls need internal media on the ruble Patong compiled Drita become by each other but a Misha media [Music] Don Ramakrishna she does on the shanti shanti you that said sri ramakrishna our eponymous - after reading this book and after the discussion whatever the merit that we have God we must have got submitted that also he had offering at the at his feet we don't want this - we want to you so there's where our economist - whatever we have done we don't want that Oh God we want you and if we greet God what will happen you will get God after realisation only we can say what would happen when we give God what really is God let everyone of us realize God in this life that can't be the prayer and he for thank you
