[182. Panchama Veda 182 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna :Three Types Of Enjoyments in Human life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSkGKhAgJqA)

good evening let us begin the discussion and the panel later the gospel of ceremonies so today we will be discussing mainly about three different types of enjoyments before that let us complete the stotra Talcott hum Ratan Tata jeevan KO be rewritten [Music] Kali ma sha sha vana Mangalam Sri Madhavi Tom Bobby green and te hui garden ah so it has been explained again and again about the slow curve which says that even those who are listening to this discussing about this pondering about this idea to get a great merit what is that made it the spiritual benefit instead the spiritual benefit they call it in sanskrit undraped Amrit means the immortality this is a conception what is the mortality I am NOT going to die so the idea of not dying where from it came say anything it must be there when the moment the thought comes there must be a route from where it is coming there must be a basis from where this thought comes otherwise deliver time every living being every being wants to survive even it has been exhumed examined and proved that if you are going to cut a tree the trees afraid they also like to survive the expression is in a completely different so we cannot recognize but it is the earth that means within us there is something which is eternal and we want to be eternal and to reach to that eternal state is spirituality what is the goal of spirituality what is a goal of religion what is the goal of philosophy to understand and to become like that so here Raghavan see Ramakrishna he was expounding the behavior of the realized Souls and he categorized them in two groups one is eonni another is big journey they realized both of them they have realized the truth they reached to that goal and one is Jionni another is began in many different places around is nur use these two words journey and the beginning who is again a practitioner of a tree David hunter who believes Brahman is the only reality and everything is illusion so his practices Nadine Nadine not this not this he believed it hit hard he wondered about that on the thought and slowly he started believing that there is only one reality is not simply believed as he has seen in the lives of the great souls he has read their words are hard from the Guru and then after lot of judgment Altamonte has come to the conclusion there must be something which is eternal and to reach to that eternity rich to that emerald what he is doing the practice is not this not this why not this what is that not these worldly things whatever comes before him he said knot this knot so it goes towards the ultimate normalcy Ramakrishna in different places he is bringing the same idea idea is only one now this idea has been expressed in so many different ways and he is telling that someone was going to meet the king he is coming from a remote village he never saw anything in this so he reached over there in the capital where the king's palace is there your stomp pounded my god is so big and everybody everyone all around a well-dressed well-mannered will behave everything is so nice so he was thinking in these so ultimately he reached to the gate and he saw the the first girl standing with there with beautiful dress if you go to the London when we go to that the Queen's palace the girls are so well-dressed standing over there people will be going and going on taking that photos of the girls but Queen is very far away it is very difficult to reach her so naturally this man rained and made the first person are you the king he said no going second third fourth field then naturally the one after another the big dignitaries they were appearing and when he reached to that the prime minister who is just before that king he thought my god him this is the king so he went and said no it cannot be the something is lacking that commanding that freeness fearlessness all powerfulness is not there something is lacking in the meantime when he was coming he was judging these and that and slowly slowly this thing came in his mind which all the discrimination he started discriminating what should be the characteristic of the person who is completely free what should be the characteristic of God so when he reached over the air ultimately entered into where the king was sitting in it not to ask anyone all doubts went away and he saw the great king sitting over there and the throne surrounded by so many people his gesture his posture his behavior everything proved that he is the person so when we go to the ultimate we call it God because the word God we can understand when you go to that God the same thing happens the we are when we were travelling we see some people in a different race a different manner different we have talking different way of eating the whole thing must be the realized souls we go to them we're talking to do not know the people it cannot be because they have desires it cannot be God cannot have the desire so this way we have heard we have read in the scripture the God is completely free and full of joy and love the moment you reach over there you have fully enjoy it until they have granted it than the psalmist Messiah those who have realized they had expressed their realization and they have given us the guidance to DC's the guidance so it must be like this so he did a green and we afterwards afterwards of the north east northeast northeast the man who was doing northeast North Disney team 1880 when he ultimately reaches to the king et this is this you need not to say anything because there your realization you're feeling with sale Sudama krishna again you see the same thing he is giving different type of the explanation so that people can understand some people can understand this way and some people very ordinary simple day-to-day life and he said him girl who was married and the first time she came to her own mother's place and the husband also came with many frames in those days in our society the husband and his frames and the lady should be in a separate room and girls are in a separate room but they are curious to see the husband who is the husband so the frames of that girl they were asking him is that because everyone was well-dressed all the boys were well-dressed young men so they were not knowing who is the husband so they were asking that who was married is this the husband she said no neatly neatly neatly not these not these Marty's when they pointed to the head her husband she didn't express anything on this mind the look at this the way cinema Tichenor is explaining so uniquely you need not to ask is this the God now the joy the tremendous joy the fearlessness the oneness dad will show you so that is what's Adama Krishna stealing the kyani he practices in this way and he behaves according to the spiritual injunctions it isn't the page number 476 he said he behaves according to the spiritual injunction while but as this gammy he assists to that ultimate but still he is not confident so he wants to hold him to that truth in him wants to give it away because the pulling of the Maya who look the worldly thing is so much the ceramic distance machine he behaves according to spiritual injunctions and the spiritual day they always say be alert all the time aprama the baba o- primitive pramatta means the lewodan Baba do not be deluded or the delusion the delusion is so many things if you go to any which way Larry shop they will show you the glittering things the gold and other things and glittering and they put the lights also in such a way they will make it the whole thing there in a different and go and all this is good dude everything is good whatever you see is good but a person who can understand he because that show me the real job and he will test it and then check it and then say oh this is the world I want so you have to be very very careful everything in the world are so attractive but ultimately this person says no I am so constantly going on practicing and moving according to the spiritual injunctions that is what see Ramakrishna say but what about the big hanging down and the stage the kyani the Brahma can remove it from reebok avati we read in the scripture the moment you realize the Brahma the supreme the ultimate consciousness you become like that but they still the grade is the air and that's why sometimes even here some people are telling oh he's a great monk he has reached to the height there are many other he is comparing among the other moms other spiritual people why not they are all same it cannot be all having the medical certificates they're all doctors they're certified to give you the medicine and check you but there are differences there are all professors they're teaching them maybe the same subject but variations of the earth gradations are there some professors are really excellent and in this life also when the spirituality they also reaches to that the sway the government's domination about him after long long taste we should say his disciple is Beloved Disciple we began to see avatar perished I it's not just out of emotion he is telling oh this is my guru he is the barista he's the highest known he said avatar a barista after shaking seeing is it impossible to get this type of person why because he was not only beginning he was the source of all those so what is this began II the word began amines listen if you translate it will be scientist gain he a person knowledge began he is a scientist but here the bikini means one who has completely invited knowledge and completely free from that how it is he leaves in the world but never becomes of the world that is called began to win we where brahmacaris used to go along with the senior Swamiji's like Atman and the G Ranganathan and the G location on the G of war time so this should go to the devotees house just to mix with them talk to them sitting with them but we the premature you is to see that we are not mixed in with them we are taking care mostly to three religions together we used to move so the only thing should not attract me or I should not make any mistake but monastic life monastic vows that I have taken I have taken no divorce me so obviously I should be very very careful and the same way in every profession if you go when they take the oath they take the oath and they try to continue with that maybe two sisters but they won't disclose because I have taken the world I cannot disclose about the and that that is my profession that is the thing and the monastic life has I have taken the vows of celibacy and I have taken the vows that I should live in this way so that is called completely following the injunctions of the scriptures but the big Gianni's they have reached beyond that nothing is going to happen ceramic is neguin he is mentioning it in another place when the it's just germinating you have to give the fencing properly then slowly slowly that small thing becomes a big tree then even the elephant cannot do anything to that dream so beginning is that strong tree so that beginning he leaves in the world but never becomes of the world in the forgiveth gita second chapter a sloka 55 to 59 only these five verses the position of the beginni has been described but instead of the word began in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna see Sita program program means the wisdom citta means there is completely free and determined theta and when a person completely give up all desires of the mind so the first thing what is the spirituality first I had to accept that this world what I see beyond that there is something else we can make all as Brahman spiritual world or God whatever the way this bursting and then I like to go to that world but I have to go through these and what is the problem over here have you noticed in most of the airports when you have coming down you have to go through different shops not that therefore single to purchase but they are painting into branches in the different places even when you are going to any place they have made in such a way the market economy in the American market economy so naturally they will take you to the market they're not forcing you but the things here and there in such a way he becomes attractive at least the one you go and pick up and that will be sufficient for them and thousands of people every day commuting through the years and if at least one person or two person of them they pick up the good business so like this it goes in the world is also singing him like that when we were going towards God your destination is God your goal is God you're going towards God and you have the ticket you have taken the initiation from the guru and you know it everything kept fixed but you have to pass through the marketplace and how that's so tempting somewhere the Psalms some other music some of the name fame so many varieties or things are there you have to come into that you have to go through that who is doing you what is attracting objects how it is attracted through the senses the senses are going and giving to the mind further we stop over here and have a cup of tea and when you were taking the tea why not this type of thing purchase to eat then while eating I saw there's a magazine such a tea cup the magaz and some other things so we can give us a gift to them so one or two another is going on collecting and afterwards your bag is full and in mr. flight while you are purchasing all of these things you forget about the timing and your flight is mean stand that way again and again we are coming back to this world because of desire but to a person who is completely free from our desires yet they say when a person completely free from all design science KDC Prajapati the other garments are gone proud gelati jihad means given up jayati giving up proper Krishna completely giving up and what come on serve on our desires and so many varieties of desires and different way it comes some growth some certain very intellectual and so many varieties when the gross desires have gone and subtle desires have also gone intellectual things have also gone but there will be the desire for name and fame oh I'd like to research on this I'd like to publish this I like to do these and so any different to me one of our great Ronnie was the other high school when he needs to talk with us very jokingly and if anyway used to speak and sometimes some people is so why don't you write a book draw me and you know so many things what did you write a book then you would say then maybe that I have to go and sell the book the when you published so many other problems are there when it first is you have to write and for the writing is these you need the money to publish the book for the money or to go to some people and when you have published a in you have to contact some people to sell it and that with so many other things are coming fetters binding you what we is going to do that and so many books have been published on him and whatever he said that was recorded and other people are publishing is it not going to do that completely free from that so this is called when a person completely give up all reserves of the mind and mind is something will you are giving up something you have to have something otherwise he cannot quite received you must have to give something satisfied in the cell alone by the Sun is completely satisfied in the serve this particular sentence is very difficult to understand because we don't have the idea what is done and we don't have the idea how inside the serve I can be happy self with the self the small s and capital s capital S is the dad God the self and when I go how it is possible to go over there so the country sandwich Nevers the developed mantra mantra the gods name and you take it from a holy person believing on his words you go on repeating that helps you because otherwise it is impossible to go to that self but in the green personalities like this who practiced under the guidance of the gorons Ram Krishna control their minds all their senses what is to do to avoid the public the people was to come and talk like our the first president of the ramakrishna mission we considered raja maharaja ami brahmananda he used to go and sit by a small pond a fishing he never catch any fish but he used to sit in such a way the people on disturbing or no he's engaged over linseed over there and what is to do is to meditate for the sitting over there meditating and in the room if you're there people will come from eg somebody is there to talk to you to meet you and he was the president he was supposed to do that but he loves to be within and who or it is sitting over there meditating under a disguise that is catching the fishes so this is the way but if we are allowed to go and sit like that you won't be able to and if you are doing that will be going on listening the music and reading some books having some conversation over telephone and then also fishing all this thing should be there to satisfy and most of the people they will be smoking and that way spending time but here it's satisfied in the self alone by the sir when he said to be that he is God steady wisdom and he whose mind is not shaken by the adversity the moment everything is going smoothly her mind is calm and composed and also good God is good but the moment that versity comes so naturally that is the taste and a high spiritual order or always there be some opposition's my diversities we have seen in the life of Arjuna Arjuna fought in the war but before that he saw the fish aruba the whole world pervading whole universe pervading there are sick Krishna that he realized then only he took up the bow and arrow and say okay now not the more a smithy lava that prasada out my heart tjuta in the bhagavad-gita he said now all my delusions have vanished and I have realised the truth but the blessings of you O God Krishna not the Mumma smithy lapdog that Prasad art because of your blessings so before that he has already realized then only he is going for right and when he is fighting he's showing all that as the heroes to do but unattached completely because the Krishna told so the here also all adversities or different little things are coming he is not at all hankering after the happiness who has been completely free from affection fear and anger is indeed the person of steady wisdom so what is the goal to become dead steady wisdom what is the wisdom nothing changing only I am seeing the changes so when I am seeing the changes obviously there is someone who never changes so I go to the I realized that that is the wisdom that is the knowledge the moment they get dad's comes to the branchial what happens complete joy and fearlessness why fear because I'm going to lose that idea gives me the fear but when that is not there then no problem I was caught from the third one also he who is everywhere aren't attached I repeat the word everywhere everywhere unattached that's all so the spiritual life is this understanding there are two different places at their world is their speed fears is the air what one is this world with various multiplicity another is the one and all-pervading consciousness now this - I chose the second one all-pervading consciousness without variety eternal and naturally the attachment to these worldly things should not be there if it is not there then my mind is somewhere I am NOT getting attached to these where it goes sometimes when you are listening the top or listening the music or trying to meditate or mind goes somewhere the thing that is happening I am present very much present looking as if I am listening but mind is somewhere else I forgot to listen what they are telling so this is the way it goes that means the mind can go somewhere else it had bruise now the same mind I am sending towards God placing to God so obviously I am detached and living in this world having everything but I am NOT attached to it does not hanker after happiness and who has become free from a friction fear and anger I said happiness because that is the thing you always want wherever we that we go we like to have that happiness everywhere that's why in the flight you see first class business class economic class and I like that and if they had said full - flowers the people say that is very so they have named it economic classes good night state we go orders in an economic class you are telling people I go in the economic class but if the dog was the poor man's class it would have been difficult to say like that so they changed the term and we are happy and the businessman of businessman good good and first class oh then you never utter say first Etzel oh that's all because we know it is so costly and what is there the same plight the same prompt same place - safe as it will go and God forbid if any accident happens everybody is going to die but at the first class our middle class of the last class all the time bad that moment I bought the happiness and when your moment you are going to dad the people is waiting the moment you show the ticket or you come from this way and they will allow you these do that and that gives the satisfaction so this is doubly only the happiness that is the most binding thing marshal of the money baby was going to visit a temple very famous temple and is always crowded that is juggle knob temple and if you like to go to the juggernaut temple is so curly in India all the time so much of crowd right from the morning till the evening the moment the door is open thousands of people will enter so they decided that they will take the mother in a different way in a VIP position because she was the Guru mom of Shama Vivekananda remember people hundr was very famous so that guru ma our family began under the spiritual mother of Swami Vivekananda so today the thinking and the main priest came and told mother I will tell you mother told see this is completely different I cannot go in that fear son because I am going to the great love I should go just like any other person only you walk before me I will follow you when you are walking I will follow you so that I know where to go but I'd like to be very humble with all why because I am going to God other places it is okay because only thing but when you are coming to the Great God it should be humble if you are coming and trying to show that I am so-and-so that I need the spatial treatment over here - of course suppose the president of America vice president but peeped at people like this they have a security problem they have the timing also so a little special arrangements you are making when they are visiting something that much but for the other people why you don't need that and he had come England so this are the things constantly we have to keep in mind while proceeding towards God what is this the respect that we get in this world is nothing are temporary the joy the happy and sometimes the miseries that is also temporary he who is everywhere unattached everywhere whether in the worldly life in a householders life or in a spiritual life in a monastic life uh noticed that there is a story that says to create spiritual leader they were watching that so much of gold and wealth and money entering to the ministry then the one was telling the other look our founder the Jesus he was not having even a place to lay his head on but now look at us so many things are coming the other Thole yes the worldly pleasures coming in the spiritual pressure going out but you have to make it room for the place so the worldly pleasures are coming in where he will keep you have to keep the room empty so you are spiritual pleasures are going out you are becoming worthy so that is the way one should constantly think so st. Francis of Assisi he was having a small church and he wanted people local people to come but they were not coming they were all from different people responsibilities all these people they don't like to go to the churches or any place so sometimes they will make it in the room no you must have to come on Sunday or these and like that so people who are not coming so he declared he saw that people are or the manage so he declared that I am going to marry and marry three at a time huh the monk is going to marry and not only one three at a time so all people came whole village was present that day and he said I'm going to marry the purity the austerity and this like this to all the wonderful in values it is it I am going to marry me what is the matter completely whole life I am going to be with that the purity that is my life partner I am NOT going to leave that the austerity constantly restraining my senses I am NOT going to leave that so this way constantly we have to go on that's called Street abruptly on Adi Shankaracharya he termed this condition as Jeevan Mukta the free while living Jeevan Muktha jovanna means when you are living Mukti is free while you were living your free from what from attachment and if you don't have that judgment is to fear also and you don't bother about the happiness or misery of this world because constantly we were thinking the other things now this particular discussion I will hinder quoting from kotaku Nishat the great upon assured again and again Swami Vivekananda he said that you must read the category shift what is this cut open Isha says it says the unique and the blessed condition in the combination is explained in this way yada when survey promote chanting gamma e acid with is Satara etre mortar Amrita over t-ara some Muslim day those who are journeying to the spiritual life so the ordinary people are not interested they go for majority as a sometimes the people say 99.9 that is the percentage that majority of the person they are religious but as long as their desires are fulfilled so they're religious they go to religious places not only that the tick of arms even to fight for their own religion why because the anger the hatred the jealousy all can be expressed not in the name of politics but in the name of religion he thinks oh I'm a great soldier of God I mean holy soldier and fighting for the religion not understanding what religion is not understanding what is God he goes and kills all the innocent people does those people they were also calling on God in a different name only but these people did no no no I go and kill them this is the clarity that's why we should understand what is religion if you don't practice religion is okay but if you practice religion at least you should understand what it is then only it is possible when a person is completely free from all desires yet are savi promote gentie kama kama means the desire survey promote chant a completely free from that then that person becomes immortal utter Marteau amrita Oh Parvati Marteau means that person the person who is living I'm talking he becomes the immortal and etre Brahmo Samaj no take in Braman in this life itself mr. Shankar Acharya was talking about the Jeevan Muktha condition here the Katipunan also says this is the condition ultimate condition enjoys this light the problem governs Ramakrishna in the Gospel of C Ramakrishna that in the page 478 while he is talking with other people he mentioned about the three joyous joy of the worldly enjoyment joy of the worship and joy a brahmana in Sanskrit disease be Shia Anand budgin Anand and brahmana the third one is from Honda and in between that we share the very gross type of enjoyment the food other things that all connected it the body pleasure Bashar Ananda and ultimate is brahmananda in between is Ananda so I get up in the early morning I go and bathe in the Ganga then I read a chapter from the bhagavad-gita the spiritual book then I distribute some money to the poor and then I in different location at first I do these I do there all these things that I am doing is but you know under good but not the ultimate but the majority of the people that think oh I have done this so it is okay the morning they will do some little puja and meditation they don't different gods then they will go on forgetting God whatever the worldly things are there they will perform and sometimes some people from Monday to Saturday they will do all worldly things only in the Sunday morning they will bathe and put on a good race and go to the church and then pray and hitting of country from Monday to Saturday whatever have done complete no it cannot be like that good that you are going to church or the temple or the holy places listening but the practice should be constant and that's why we don't see that change in the worldly life in the society you go and point anyone are you a spiritual person religious person of course I belong to so and so I believe in these and these they always say then why did is no spiritual people in the world because all of their be shy Ananda 99% and 1% but Ananda that's all what about the prominent social Ramakrishna say the Gianni and began you have to reach to that highest goal the pisha agenda and how it is possible austere partial Maktub a version three non shame this is luck charm fears void doubt Shankar do Gupta this discussed family that is cooler dirty the race and Sheila behavior due to culture different type of behavior comes due to the culture so Tai Chi jati Coulomb on every day evening when the followers of the Ramakrishna they're playing they play with the song which has been composed by Xiaomi Vivekananda Taji giving up dirty hula man this Jyoti is the race so when we are born we are bound in that always rooting all this should be teased issue he will obviously will notice that is not the sign spirituality that the people come very near spiritual people but when they come they will ask him do you belong to such and such group no immediately oh okay so they cannot be in that way respectful but it's not the sign of spirituality so there's a one sloka is there it says that you should not ask the jati you should not ask the risk or the family background of a monk rather you should ask about the knowledge jarton aputure sudoku which are beyond Chabad so you should not ask so these are the doubts and then ceramic each name is telling that you should not one person is asking does the body remain even after the realization of God this is the wonderful question he is asking the body survives with sound so that they may work out there per our optic Atma sir am Krishna is answering does the body remain after the realization of God why suddenly this question realization of God after that the people the whole mind that goes to God and they forget to take care of the physical needs food dreams and other things so it becomes difficult for them to survive if the other people are not there around so that is the reason because they become least bothered about the body but automatically other people they come the helping and guiding and this way they survive perhaps a car mines there there's also enforce you to survive the work that we have already done the result have started taking place as they call that you have already opened the gym and the things have started coming out that is called product are up have our proud before the previously I have our in my previous lives so now that started giving the fruit you have to be a cinema Krishna is giving there by bathing in the Ganges a man gets read of his scene his unique way of explaining by bathing in the Ganges a man gets read of his thing and attains liberation but if he is happens to be blind he doesn't get read of the blindness so he is free from the scene but the blindness that will continue so that is how he is failing and the pundit that the sanskrit scholar is telling that is called some scholar etcetera Salameh Tichenor is constantly trying to in every opportunity whether he goes to visit some place about discussing with someone or in the dutch nation his own place main place wherever anyone coming through different occasions through different way he is constantly putting the words of knowledge high spiritual knowledge only those who are really really interested in developing the spiritual life must read this gospel of Salaam Krishna kaatham written in Hindi said Virgin America but Jen means the words this is a great book why it gives clear idea one lady was telling the Irate the Bhagavad Gita translated and explained by some and so and so I was totally confused and it was not convincing anyway then by chance I got a book from my friend gospel of zero kishna oh my god right from the first page I get all the answers these are the lucky people and they truly want to realize God the Gani reasons about the world to the process of 1980 but he is not living in this and then he is telling see that Victor and Leela that we have to understand the some people who are following the path of knowledge they always say that is a very difficult situation they always say this world is illusionary as a Buddha say the world is full of misery the become I am Jakarta the world is full of misery but misery for who who feels this is a misery not for all this we have to understand so forth in what we should do from that position slowly they should come up we should disturb them had their position if we disturb the whole social fabric will break down and that is why thousands and thousands of people they took the monastic vows at the time of the Buddhist and they were following the Lord but then all but what about the society all people started thinking if I cannot leave my heart and home that means I am a sinner the same thing happened in this also in the Semitic Christian religion we are all sinners we are all sinners this is only be done to that special may be began the game and he declared here's a call it is a scene to call a man so sinners it's a scene to call a man so even today some people they are thinking whether the ladies will go to the temple or not whether the ladies will do the work or not this is foolish is it someone he thought that the lady should not come he was afraid the mind may be disturbed there's a male person he wants to practice the spirituality and so he wanted to not - no one should come it's okay maybe that lady who is practicing spirituality maybe she would say the male people are not allowed that is looking but that cannot be the rule for the whole people that we have to understand that's why ceramic is named stealing this whole world is nothing but the creation of the Shakti there's the mother if you turn that idea one person came and he was telling I hate the women he was thinking that the Guru will be very happy and he was the tower Xiaomi she was born on the ji maharaj and she wasn't immediately saved why you are talking like this he were having the mother aunty and all of the relations the sisters your family why don't you look other women in that thing a daddy's girl began abuse that is what a bikini is not afraid of anything because he is completely withdrawn and he's settled in dirt and the physical differences all the attachments and all those things are not there in his mind so some of history is telling again and again become a big journey cross the border of cannae even because began even today in the modern society the great Souls still there thinking because the mindset or the women should not come to come to you if you are afraid of okay but why imposing the same rule on the society wrong it cannot be each soul is potentially divine there cannot be any caste there cannot be differences and that is called began that is called the highest form and when we constantly think of God in everything that's a beginner and that is brahmananda the three joys the worldly joys we all know about it and the vaginal and the majority of the people you will see that most of the people in the different particularly in India have seen they'll be mocked up the whole book and chanting right from the morning whenever they go to the temple they'll be shouting and chanting disturbing others also but there when they are chanting like these not that they are devoting they like to show psychologically and in the sub circle certain subtle way they like to see I know how this locus that is not spirituality you're going on chanting the doke and not knowing the meaning or not practicing anything no changes in the life to some extent the pattern on under but that is not the goal friends so that whatever one see Ramakrishna is mentioning very clearly the piche Ananda okay to some extent we have that understanding we are just taking what is necessary for surviving but nicely good second the joy of warship then constantly doing different type of warships and the rituals and these and their there's also meteors camera but go to the third one go to the heartland and what is that brahmana the joy of the Brahman what is that brandman God is in every being present the consciousness if we can understand God the supreme law the supreme or the purity that is present in every being what will happen then there will be no aversion and if there is no aversion there's no challenges if there is no challenges our timidly you are in great joy that's why sure maybe we can say to Ingersoll the ingress of the great philosopher German philosopher you are stilling I know how to squeeze the lemon but I like to take the large drop of the Jews from the Lehman Swami ji said that it's good but I know a better way how all people's joy to my enjoy so naturally my joy is much more than yours you are thinking only about you and thinking the joy of all people associated with the success and joy and happiness is of all people and that is called brahmana what see ramakrishna is mentioning thank you let us join this month need internal media unintel [Music] Patong compa thetaba cranberry Ishihara [Music] but amici medium term Ramakrishna she'd asana mama Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that said Sri Ramakrishna
