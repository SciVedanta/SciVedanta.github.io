[131: Panchama Veda 131- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Le5DgIYNwM)

in it to give this discussion after reciting this sloka hip adductor me tava Kadam rhythm topped achieve annum Kobe very written calm of sharp 'him Severna Mangalam three MoDOT Atem booby green aunty a gory dodging aha those who sprayed them broadcast are verily magnanimous they distribute what is completely satisfying to the hearers what is that they say is the words of God the scene effacing utterances and this theme effacing utterances means this is actually whatever the wrong conception that we are having that is removed now the conception that we are human being second we are related to this world and third we take birth we leave for some time then we die this is the whole conception and as long as we are living how best we can leave that is the whole idea now on the basis of this only we are trying to develop this world and as maximum comfort that we can give to us that we apply but the ultimate goal is happiness ultimate desire to live eternally the ultimate wishes to know everything these are the three things always hidden in the every human soul we like to know everything and we like to leave for eternity we don't like to die and we want all through every moment the joy what is the secret that is the reason the God he comes down takes the human form and he expresses the what is all this today the Quran see Ramakrishna as he was explaining the different things today he'll be explaining spirituality and the householders life how difficult it is millions and millions of householders are there how to develop the spirituality so here we find that the discussion is going on and in the last time as we have discussed already that all depends on God's will so that is a type of discussion now yet it comes and says you have to exert you have to try your that a for that you will be giving that you'll also bring the good result did you hear the song that he is asking the song is the wonderful way and that was the special way of everyone see Ramakrishna to express to explain his ideologies why said should one whole to God with one hand and to the world with the other as Salam o Krishna was delete now you should hold God with one hand and the world other that means you do you your whatever responsibilities duties but at the same time keep on repeating the name of God so that when the time will come you can give up the other hand and completely surrender yourself to God so that is the way he says and what is this samsara what is this world that we see in sanskrit they say Satya Anita Brittany good way it is mixed with truth and untruth there's the mixed and what is the truth that we will discuss today that is very very special when we say the false does it mean that it is not there it is there but in a different form explaining things in a different way when we say he told the lies now just now I got that I was reading the newspaper I found that the minister in Kannada he is in great difficulty he is from Indian origin he went to India he boasted over there and whatever he informed over there that was not true so obviously the objections are coming if the minister is giving wrong information in a foreign country how can he be the minister of this country so that fellow said I'm sorry I just exaggerated something that's true I'm sorry for that now things are going on in this week whatever it may be not that he didn't say the things he said but in a different manner when he said things in a different manner which is not exactly with it untruth false myth but the moment we say Mitra does it mean that it is not existing it is existing only in a different form when Shankracharya is telling this jagat mithya brahma satyam jagan mithya the brahman is truth and this jugger this universe that you see it is completely untrue does it mean it is not there when you translate that word we always say it is not there wrong it is there the only thing we don't see eat understand it properly so that is the McDow so this way the conversation was going on now here when the gentleman told why don't you plunge completely 100% dedicating ourselves for the realization of God what is the problem see this emotional utterances we like to realize God now like the bhagavad gooder he sat on one place and then resolved that he Harsanyi sister to me should Edom I am going to give up the body here itself on this seat unless and until I realized the truth can we do that before that he had a wonderful preparation create preparation he was almost reaching to the ultimate thing only it became whatever promises you take and you see it and after half an hour knees will pain back will pain will be phone call and people will be waiting for you then you have to get a world I have tomorrow I will try this tomorrow will go on repeating it goes in that way so when that he is telling like these this gentleman out of emotion why you are asking us to hold God in one hand why not in two hands but he was not sincere he was just out of emotion he was telling ramakrishna is telling did you listen to the song mana a cushy katya non is a very famous song by a great sage and he was a tantric ah he practiced the Tantra sadhana the realized God through the country way and their only thing that used to do compose the song and sing and the great devotion and he got the realization sir Aman Manav german ruiz appetit Abad the choral a full tishanna that is the Bengali way this human life it was there as it is a beautiful land far Thailand but unfortunately you have not utilized dan is just barren like this you could raise lot of this you could utilize this land so mana but you mean the human as if is the land that could be utilized but when you are putting the seeds what happens when they are growing up the birds come animals come and they eat have and all the things so many types of people is becoming to eat that up to protect that particular tree what you should do Colleen ami Bao Rivera for sure late but Rukavina then he says the head indeed that you have to give all around then you will get the fruit then you will get the crops otherwise you won't so that is the theme and what is that Kali nama go on repeating the name of Kali so what a householder should do go on repeating the name of God that's all and nothing else you needed to bother about that whatever duty you were doing you do and maximum the morality to practice that you should practice and at the same time go on repeating the name of God colleen ami de ribera for surely such a Rukavina why because he mocked okay sheesh October is it very very hard fencing and even the greatest enemy that is the Yama the king of death you won't be able to approach you so that way he says and he says that he who has realized God it is page 326 he who has realized God knows that God himself has become the world and all living beings this is pure bid answer that he is talking but he is not using the Grumman he's using the word God so does the devotional approach but it is abaddon turn in the pedantic way if you say in faith the brahman they created this universe and the brahman entered into it that the sister tam eva on oprah Visha god this world they were discussing about this world who has created this universe so God as the Brahman has created God swished wha after creating this universe but it is inert so you need the life the consciousness so what he did cut the switch - ah Tommy book on a bra vicious but the ebon a provision and he into as Eve entered into it and that is the God created human being and he gave the life into it so that is the way the Christianity than Islam so every as because the would dicen do not accept the conception of God or anything so they didn't explain but this he said one who has realized God what he will see that is ultimate thing one who has realized God or make progress in the spiritual life can he criticize others no because he will see that the same God who is sitting as an very ordinary very unintellectual person and the most immediate sitting over there is also God but a very intelligent person that's also manifestation of God so how he will criticize it is his will so here he says the he who has realized God knows that God himself has become the world and all living green when you feed your child now on the basis of these now a householder should practice spirituality in everyday life how he is giving in simple example when you are feeding your child you should feel that you are feeding God you should feel you should think strongly that so that is the spirituality that you'd be practicing and it is so simple you need not to go to anywhere only at home you can practice it and you should look on your father and mother as venerable manifestation of God and the Divine Mother and serve them as such if a man enters the world after realizing God he does not generally keep up physical relations with his wife both of them are devotees they love to talk only of God and pass their time the spiritual conversation they serve other devotees of God for they know that God alone has become all living beings and knowing this they the devotee they leave into the service of the others that is the householders life husband and wife but at the same time they feel that we are both the devotee of God I have seen some of the families husband and wife they're so devoted to God and they have a wonderful routine right from the morning to the night every day they'll be doing like that I have seen a very very elderly person and he they are the parents of one of our Swamiji I went to see them the gaiter early in the morning they go to Ganga after bathing they come back then they will worship the Shiva there the Shiva worshippers will worship the Shiva and after that is complete the gentleman will be worshiping and the lady will be hating him to worship after that is done then the lady will prepare some breakfast very simple breakfast they will eat the breakfast and then afterwards they will open a book and read from there both of them reading and listening and then afterwards the gentleman will go out for marketing and little bit in the meantime he is clean she is cleaning that this whole life is going on 11 o'clock once again the seat and read some books then the meditate then the play then whatever the food they offer to God in the eat take a little rest get up in the then afternoon again open a book and read then go out both of them for walking and saying hello to the neighbors and whatever this the socializing here and there they come back evening prayer after the evening be read the book and for a whatever a long time possible practice the spirituality its some again little food and then dysley life is going on in this routine the wonderful life so happy people are all around people all the neighbors are also coming so sometimes some people say after the retirement from the job we are dissatisfied and what to do and what not to do whatever possibility is there if you can help help others and think that I am solving God satisfaction will come and joy will come that is the teaching of Raghavan C Ramakrishna and here the person is telling but said such a husband and wife are not to be found anywhere he said it is not possible master say Ramakrishna stealing yes they can be found though they may be buried here you cannot say it is impossible it is possible they can be found though they may be very rare that is okay the worldly people cannot recognize them in order to lead such a life both husband and wife must be spiritual here this but once Ramakrishna is not using the word religious he is killing spirit it is possible to lead such a life if both of them have tested the Bliss of God did not immediately it is possible if they have practice for a long time then they will know and whatever the job that we do if you have noticed we in your morning you are getting and then doing the japa and after that immediately should not leave the seat quietly just you are sitting you can see that wonderful the impression will come on you the happiness would be deal in the mind so that we both of them if they are having if they have tested the Bliss of God God spatial grace is necessary to create such a couple otherwise there will be always will be misunderstanding between them and in that case the one has to leave the other light becomes very miserable you husband the wife do not agree see this is the regular thing that you always find so husband and wife is not agreeing and so many problems are coming up and all this but if there is a common interest is there then there is no problem so that is the thing is the common interest is there a little bit of these things on that thing everywhere so how to utilize our life those who are in the household how to live happily this is the a common thing is necessary where both the minds will go and make other little bit of things okay sometimes the he is killing I won't go she is telling I like to go these are the little bit of things always the human personality no differs but the common thing is there one gentleman told in the ramakrishna mission there is no spiritual people psychologically off the path so these thing is spirituality means Baraka we have to show the miracles of Krishna mission Swami never like that and never so that so he thought that the miracle is not there whether you are coming everybody is touching the head and hugging them and then gay nothing like that what is then spirituality then I told you see here we are two thousand educated young named each and every one is having his own ideology ideals and his own philosophy and you ask any problem immediately any question he will give in his own views expressed that that the strong personalities are there not that whatever you say we have fallen God Allah not like that but at the same time 2,000 of us we are living in this organization listening to our seniors whatever they say immediately we try to do that and not only one day or two life long we're doing how it is possible because we have a common interest all of us the minds are going and meeting in the want freedom of Krishna whatever these our seniors are telling there is a command of the God I must do because that will bring good to me satisfaction so what we are doing bechara all this knowledge that also you are following meditation and other devotional things that also you are following but at the same time one common interest is there that is to develop the spirituality how to develop the spirituality by banishing the ego when you can minimize your ego vanish your ego the completely free from the ego then you are spiritual ceramic isne is talking about the spirituality devotee there are such other obstacles besides the children may be disobedient apart from the husband wife the disagreement and others may be children are disobedient there is no end of difficulties now sir what is the way he is asking he is asking all the so practical see at the time of ceramic is not the same thing is with their same type of problem is extremely difficult to practice spiritual discipline at the same time lead the householders lives Ramakrishna's at meeting and he is also he also said that if a householder practicing spirituality and he takes one step towards God God will come 20 steps towards him because the goddess understand what difficulty he is fallish there's a story there not as others and he became boastful and say to God I am your best devotee isn't it I am taking the name of God all the time I never do anything except looking at you and all this thing that's true every time you are doing but can you please go and see at the great devotees there whom I really consider one of the best devotees you go and look at him he is a cultivator is a very ordinary person is a poor man go and see how he is doing see I will you can understand the great devotee then he went over there and he saw the man right from the morning he got up J levonne then he was just glory unto God he will take the name of God and he'll jump to work you he have to take the things to the the field and cultivating the field and bring me already work coming back washing himself and taking the name of God once on me and sleeping because next morning here to get up so he observed for two-three days and came back you consider him as a devotee look at him he is taking only twice only morning one only time he takes in the morning and in the end before going to gate he takes your name only was i am taking millions of times constantly you say that's true but can you please do one thing for me he gave a small cup full of the oil and that without splitting even a drop you have to go and come round to this this one little place that he showed him but one little club should not go into it not as the way integrate cautiously constantly thinking that one group should not fall he came back he was very happy not a single drop fell on the ground I am successful great but how many times you took my name you name how that is possible I was constantly putting my whole name of mind over here that is the reason at that person he is taking so much of responsibility to maintain his family even then he is taking name twice in the morning and the evening and only a little bit of this thing you were you could not take even as an you before starting you could take my name you forgot that and after completing that you could take my name that also for God let's look at it who is great so that is why one monk wrote to Bazar the money baby I am taking the name of God in the daytime the night in the evening but I don't really Scott the mother in zipline Road you have become a monk you have left your heart and home there is no other job for you except taking the name of God go on doing that what else we will do the demands they are supposed to they take the name of God and if they are doing any work they should consider that I am doing God's work 24 hours they should remember because that is the reason they have lived their heart and home and that is the reason the society supporting them if they don't do that that is a scene that they will be creating committing they should not see Ramakrishna isn't that is he said yes it is extremely difficult to practice spiritual discipline at the same time to lead this householders life but still there is a way out he said still there is a way out one should pray to God one first thing one should pray to God second going now and then into solitude third make efforts to realize him these three things the my planning is that we should have we are already having on acting for guestrooms sometimes people become but the majority of them and not for that spiritual practices they come over here Steve area and then they take a car and go to visit the Chicago City and all that young people is okay but some people may come and stay at least for seven days ten days away from home and taking little food coming and sitting you know that this is very very calm and quiet place libraries there read books and do little helps the Swami's whatever weight is possible very very few people to do that but because the arch is not there so they can do you have to come and stay all alone the ceramic Asian is very very practical and he is giving this instruction that it is extremely difficult to practice spiritual discipline at the same time lead a household of life then he said but still there is a way out one should pray to God perhaps in a lady American lady she comes over here she sits in that corner and she'll be praying continuously sometimes I go to her and say want to take looking forward or any coffee or tea no I am fine he's going on bringing continuous if she has not got something inside it is impossible to sit like that a long time another gentleman comes he also sits on the floor and then going on praying one day I I thought what is weird because it was little jerk and then I saw the human being sitting over there for such a long time the people are there not that they are not but if you get the proper guidance then it is good what you should do pray to God going now and then into solitude and make effort to realize him then the gentleman is asking he goes a very practical mast one leave on them he is asking the ceramic is not no not all together whenever you have leisure go into solitude for a day or two that will be sufficient at that time don't have any relation with the outside world and don't hold any conversation with the world people all the people means all the not general things and worldly affairs you must leave either in solitude or in the company of holy men the retreats that you organize what is the purpose this is the purpose giving an opportunity in America real opportunity in India we don't have this type of facilities which are some will be having such a huge facility as we are having in the Ganges and majority of the hasta miles even in America they are not having all these facilities that the Ganges retreat is having I have seen that one for only in the morning all they go and the whole to the Spain and come back because there is no facility to stay Candice is really good of nowadays the trained I just observe people are coming and going and staying over there they call it personal retreat so that is also good that way they go and read the books and all empty no one is there you are compared to sit quiet there is no one to talk to so that is the way it is Salam o Krishna is again and again he is talking and he what is the spirituality actually and it says that the spiritual guy was quoting in somewhere I think in Sacramento in the dark and subha hitam Shuba hitam that is the book is the wonderful quotations are there and it says Paro Pokhara our tongue para pagar our thumb Bonte not dia the rivers flowing for the benefit of others is taking from the night nature para pagar our tongue the hunty gaya the cows give milk for the benefit of others para Hoopoe Karim Villante rickshaw the trees we have fruit for the benefit of others the Trib itself is not eating the fruits and peru pokhara Edom sure Edom the human body meant for the service of others when you think in that way everything that I see in the nature they are giving everything for the benefit of others my human body my intellect mind all these things that I am having it should be devoted for the benefit of others that is spirituality this thought and the action followed with this thought spirituality knowledge about spirit and what is that spirit spirit is non-physical anything non-physical is infinite anything non-physical is infinite so that is called the spirituality here in it goes in this way and the Lord Jesus and the st. John in his book is mentioning I am the spirit then he that worship at me as spirit worship at me in truth the Jesus is also telling I am the spirit and always we make the mistake that Jesus to be followed what is that Jesus who gave the life in the cross no he is not the human being he came took the human form that particular people all around that he inspired them but his teaching his eternal what is that I am the spirit and Spirit has no form and spirit is eternal if not that then it is not the spirit I am the spirit and he that worship at me worshiping me as spirit worshiping me in truth and that is the reality if you worship me only in this form there's the only way is inspiration sometimes some people make the same mistake in the Hinduism Krishna those were the followers of Krishna again they narrowed their views only Krishna is the God sarva-dharman but if they just mommy come shallow numbers you give up everything and then what is the meaning of that keep up also responsibility I have complete faith in me I will take care of you and who is the Thai all-pervading God all powerful God that is the spirit the moment we close down to only that figure that is the narrowness and we make the mistake the before Krishna there is no people spiritual people after those Krishna people who do not believe in that particular form of dinner Richard this is the question only you were understanding in between not else Jesus Christ is 2000 years before Jesus Christ humanity's last at least in thousand years in all this last eight thousand years before Jesus they were not religious at all all of them had gone to hell hell it cannot be and those who are not believing the Jesus will they also go to hell that cannot be so we had to interpret things in a right spirit and this is the call in the Hinduism also daivam Buddha they've Emilia jail when you worship we sit and then what we do the very first thing we do oh fish know on Vishnu on Vishnu I am that Vishnu everywhere Vishnu means everywhere restorative is no I'm the spirit and so many times is all making you're thinking I am the divine I am the divine I am the divine then you are worshiping the divinity raising yourself to divine state then only you're worshiping regular if you are doing the worship it becomes just a normal thing but if you are sincerely doing it you are really every everyday worship means you are feeling that complete that meditation I am the spirit but one the Shami be vacant on the case eight the spiritual knowledge is the only thing that can destroy our miseries forever misery so what are we are limited so naturally I am afraid when I am afraid so I want the suffering is there so all type of miseries only because of the wrong notion long knowledge spirituality is the only knowledge that can help you to go beyond that and there are different type of Dhanam giving that the donation we give and the help we give there are four types categories of for Donna Gianna Vidya prana and Katya foot the wing you are giving spiritual knowledge that is the best Donna that we are helping Xiaomi to Yanam de ji Maharaj he was very sick and one young boy a brahmacari he used to serve him one day the Brahma jury was coming down Ventura and the G started scolding him then after that as a senior swami his brother disciple asked him show me why he was coding he looks after you so much but still why you scolded him then the Xiaomi told he looks after only this physical body I looks after his soul as the spiritual leader I am looking after his soul and they look after only the physical body and this is the duty of a spiritual leader to see that his followers his disciples his people should not make any wrong step that is his duty as a spiritual father as a spiritual mother majority of the time we don't do that of course when the number is small which is impossible but when the number is placed and those who are very close to you serving you physically you must have to say majority of the time we don't do that each other let them go no that is wrong you must have to tell them point it out to them that this is the wrong way that you are doing and by doing it you are actually not making any progress in the spiritual life so that is the real responsibility of the spiritual leaders spiritual teachers the Guru's turian and the G get the create gurus and that is reason is to do like that another wonderful incident is there in New York one lady American lady she used to come she's to complete her all household work and then she used to take a tram and cross the whole city and attending the arranging the class of the schwa me and arranging his food arranging his house room and then also taking the notes of his lecture collecting the donation from the people who have come visited and now even after all these Sami is to scold her all the time whenever there's little occasion he will go on scolding that lady one day he was too much to see access ammiji why do you school me you don't score others were you scolding me this show means you looked at her and say because I like to see you perfect I like to see you perfect that is the reason the scolding means all the time giving that teaching that you must be perfectly must be perfect so that is spirituality spiritual knowledge is the highest for each say from many many and many a birth Xiaomi becomes I'm coating many many and many effort that is the spiritual knowledge ceramic isne is mentioning about the spiritual knowledge and then it is continuing and he says he who has surrendered his body this gentleman is wonderful and he is asking another question you have just said that one must go in solitude or in the company of it in the company of holy men then he is asking how can you recognize a holy man this is a good question and immediately see ramakrishna is giving the answer is killing he who has surrendered his body mind and innermost self in to God is utterly a holy man he has nothing else except course in his third in his Bolivia in his manner in his life full of that god-consciousness he who has surrendered his body mind and innermost self to God is surely a holy man this is very subtle thing completely very very inner thing how he will understand that then next he said he who has renounced the last and gold is surely a holy man so whether he has surrendered his mind to God or not how to know but if a person has given up the last and gold notice I for the world no desire for the physical comfort that is surely a holy man he is a holy man and he says who never forgets to look upon a woman as his mother and to offer heart his worship if he happens to be meal heart the holy man constantly thinks of God and does not indulge in the talk except about spiritual things further he serves all being knowing that God resides in everybody's heart these in general are the signs of Allah man ad Vista Salva bhutanam Mitra Karuna Evita mill mama near ahamkara sama suka suka semi Sun toaster satatam yogi yet Othman run is Chaya in the bhagavad-gita 16 chat at the 3rd 1st 2nd and 3rd local 26 quality that is going to man and the moment you do that the first is Audrey stop servo bhutanam that is the first thing the moment you say if you are following my philosophy my ideology my God my church you Solomon in the first peep you failed because the broadness should be there but at the same time you have to guide the people that if you're going over there it may create problem a group of people they came you wanted to come over here they wanted to participate I talked to them and I found that the leader of that group is very mystic person then I told okay sir we will contact two October's if it is possible even possible so little bit me at this moment I cannot I did never introduce them with the devotees I knew it will be difficult difficult for devotees so that is the reason understanding whom we can introduce and what is better we as a father spiritual father that you should try so because after so many years to experience we understand what the goodness is there in a human being the particular person is a good person but a standard of spiritual development is very very primary so that is the reason we should not must one always leaving solitude this manner which is again asking Mastan one leave in solitude then Master is Ramakrishna stealing haven't you seen the trees on the footpath along the street they are fenced around as long as they are very young otherwise cattle destroy them but there is no longer any need of fences when their trunk in their trunks grow thick and strong then they won't break even even elephant is tied to them slark is the immediate example so long that you are growing up into spirituality you need that same thing don't go to anyone and most of the people they will be reading this book Goga and then and then totally confused so then we say read only those books today I have received a letter from a very young man a student from Euro and he said I need your guidance I know there are so many books but I need your guidance because what are the books that I should start with so that way slowly slowly slowly slowly if you are growing up then you will see oh yes it is possible and the best books that you can understand that is Swami Vivekananda's for yoga's there's a real excellent guidances the four yoga's because these are the four paths for attitudes for different temperaments of a human being that is leading to the god Swami we can the gave that path don't read any other books an explanation of the others read the original because who is swami vivekananda ceramic is to himself me and you are not different Ramakrishna told so many times I and you are one if the ceramic is not giving that expression that God Himself is giving the expression and he is giving what is bhakti the devotion wonderful way he is taking our mind and if I feel this is the path for me with that follow that apply those things in your life if you think that karma yoga there's the path through the unselfish world that is passing follow that take a one ideology and leave into that that is the guidance then here we find the neighbor is asking some Excel Amma Krishna is telling that that discrimination is killing you have to apply your discrimination for spirituality then he is drink discrimination what is discrimination decision is asking and see Ramakrishna discrimination is the reasoning by which one knows that God alone is real and all else is unreal is not telling false unreal brahma satyam jagat mithya Jeeva remember not opera that is what is the statement of Shankar Acharya the moment he said matka we naturally translated false and whenever we think it is a false we think it is not existing no it is there is a no Krishna perfectly is telling unreal real and unreal what is the difference again he is clarifying what is real and unreal real means eternal and unreal means impermanent now we know anything that is permanent is real what are the things that are permanent except God except the Spirit except the Brahman nothing is permanent the Buddha LaVon Buddha is not permanent but with the who'd good the means knowledge the giana that is permanent but not the body that realized that not that person who realized that so Buddha he was Gautama because he was his foster mother was go to me so naturally his name was Gautama and go butas mother was Maya baby father was should Dodona look at this should throw up this pure and that is the Donovan is the treasure this purity is the treasure and the mother is the Maya illusion the moment he was born within one or two days the Maya the mother is by she died passed away when the lady who came and helped him to grow up his Gautama from there go to me from there to go to mom so he was whenever Gautama then she'd Arthur then the Buddha so these three names and this is the discrimination and the reasoning by which one knows that God alone is real and real means eternal he who has a cure discrimination knows that God is the only substance who all else is non-existent with the awakening of the spirit of discrimination a man wants to know God on the contrary if a man loves the unreal such things as creature comforts named him and the world then he doesn't want to know God who is the very nature of reality through discrimination between the real and unreal 1-6 to know God and Adi Shankaracharya in his famous treatise famous book be being a Jew Romani in the fifteenth verse he mentioned a to be Chara could tip you now which are discrimination is necessary who will do that Jigyasa art mobis guna the seeker of spirituality should take to reasoning if you are not seeker of spirituality reason is not how to emotionally go to God and we got only to give us some protection you need not to bother about the discrimination but if you are real seeker of God you really like to know that first is which other discrimination and what type of discrimination whether the God is real eternal or not that is discrimination and then again Shankara in eighteen sloka of the same book he mentioned our dough mixture anita was to be baker Puri gonna be first is discrimination between the real and the unreal and the beginning of the spiritual life discrimination in the beginning we are coming to the school and then learning alphabets and this slowly growing up then we are doing to the colleges then we are thinking what type of knowledge that I should have clear if this I can learn whether I can help the society and also can earn money so they calculate and then they learn similarly in the spiritual life also when we have grown up that because of the parents because of the environment we come and we come to the spirituality to the temple we do the worship and when one place I went in America here with small children the parents they have taught them they are coming and just like the Indian tradition will be lying down on the floor and offering predominance not knowing what they are doing the born in America grew up in America studying in Jamaican school this Indian culture this is very good respecting the senior but why that is the question when they grow up they must get this knowledge parents should tell them that this is the thing that we are teaching you because of this this this thing when that is there they are clear then with great zeal and love they will follow the path of God otherwise just go to Temple and do something rituals without understanding what we are doing and after a few times they'll be there thinking what actually we are doing just because for the sake of the parents we are going or by sheer habit okay they will never get the benefit of spirituality and that is what Raghavan see Ramakrishna he was teaching us today that it should be one should be very very careful so today we have learned from bhagavati ramakrishna two things one is God is the only reality because he is eternal the telling God it may be called as many other things also in many other names also there is the only reality and one should try to realize that reality how fast he said that you must go into a solitude and read your own mind and then do not spend your time gossiping or reading these are dead concentrate why I have come to the
