[244: Panchama Veda 244 : Hold Fast To God & Do Your Duty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrC9JwIBLl4)

namaskar good evening they are devotees and friends like every wednesday we study the gospel of krishna panchama veda today also we will do the same so we'll be reading from the october 19 1884 sometimes the different publication page number of the book that i am following may not tell you with you some of you you say that you want to know about the date so this is october 19 1884 sirama krishna attending a program in the brahma-samaj siti in kolkata suramar krishna was explaining that as all pervading spirit god is present in every being as this is very interesting suramar krishna usually we think is a dualist but when we explain anything we can understand he is explaining from the advaithic point of view so many of you know that swami vivekananda wanted to have an astrama in himalaya then finally two of his disciples that captain and mrs savior who followed sid swami vivekananda from london they purchased a plot of land still it is there the beautiful place and you can stand in the asthma and can you can see a huge rained rain of the snow clad mountains that is called mayabati in himalayan region so there swamiji told that ramakrishna mission is because it is the a combination of all different faiths different paths so let this asthma be a purely advaith in astra and he didn't allow to worship over there including the worship of bhagavan sirama krishna in the adrita hastama there is forget about the forget about the images even there is no picture of bhagavan sirama krishna that one can go and worship so that was advanced went there and he was searching different rooms how the swamis and brahmacharyans are leaving and he found in one room one brahmachari he developed his personal shrine then he complained to the in-charge swami why you should go and you should see that and there's no dualistic ritual is allowed over here but didn't tell that brahmacari then that was that swami and others they wrote to mother ma sharadamani devi can't we worship bhagavan siram krishna in our own ashram he is our ideal so swami vivekananda is telling that we are all advaitin but can't you worship sirama krishna even you know that beautiful answer masha already when he gave he is an advaitan and you too all of you are advaitin this is the highest viewpoint philosophy of any philosophies and that god is one now sirama krishna is explaining why he is explaining because one devotee he was attending the program and all the brahma devotees they were there and there was a person uh who was working as sub-judge the master masha instead of mentioning his name he has mentioned again and again sub-judge is the post and sub-just that gentleman he was asking the the has god given by choosing that this man will get more power that man will get more power the favoritism krishna was giving the answer and there he mentioned as paul pervading spirit in sanskrit it's called bibu all pervading spirit god is present in every being we have to listen it carefully as all pervading spirit god is present in every being now he said he is in the ant as well as in me as srama krishna and also the ant the presence of god is same swami vivekananda afterwards puts this each soul is potentially divine divinity already present and because the ant is a time tiny a small thing no is a presence is same but manifestation of the power then then he said there are different manifestations of his power god's power in different beings so this if we understand so we will understand that we should not hate people or look down upon anyone because he's not having any quality or feel jealous because somebody is more advanced than me and more popular nothing like that is the manifestation of the god's power how it comes karma fella because of the past birth he must have done something good so that is why he is having this quality now i will also do some good in this life and i am sure that in the next life i am going to get all those benefits so this is obvious that he is telling a brahmana devotee he asked and he was giving this there's no more that the power that god is given it is depending on that gentleman's or the person's karmapala but another gentleman intervened and he said to the sub-judge oh why don't you accept whatever he is telling as if stop the conversation just accept okay okay like that salam krishna didn't like it those who have read that you know sudama krishna was not at all liking it rather very shortly he said what is this this is hypocrisy the hypocrisy that sudama krishna is mentioning he didn't like because accepting without understanding is hypocrisy hypocrisy is a sign of subdued mind the free mind they'll never do it the free mind always try to understand it clearly and accept it that is the sign of a free mind but the hypocritic person he will just act just like that okay okay because the situation is aggressive let me adjust but he's not accepting that ideology mostly the servants they go on accepting whatever the boss is telling the owner is telling so it is okay like that but a free mind will never do it he will go and ask and ask and get the clarification and then he will accept this is very very important particularly when we are trying to realize god one should be very clear about it and then he proceed so just some friends are going over there and i go and i like them also i i don't understand but since all people are doing let me also do like that since all people are behaving like so let me also be no not like that it should be you should be very clear now that gentleman the sub judge he's asking sir must we renounce the world this is a very important question in the scripture it says unless and until you are renouncing you are not going to get the that means the god realization realization of the brahman the knowledge of brahman and the the very first thing is tiaga now look at sirama krishna the great master the moment you ask that man when the gentleman is asking the shall we have to give up the the family life this our householders life then suramar krishna is telling no why should you very first this is the the psychologically he is inspiring that man no you need not to do that and then he's preparing himself mind a man can realize god even in the world correct but at the beginning he must spend a few days in solitude a few days in solitude is putting the thing in such a way that as if it is nothing but if in the beginning you say oh no it is not possible for you people then you lose all hope but suramar krishna is preparing the mind in such a way you live in the world well prepare your mind living in the solitude what he will do in the solitude a few days he is telling as if it's nothing a few days you go and spain but ultimately you have to prepare your mind for dyaga for renunciation and what is that renunciation ego the salaam krishna is so clear and sometimes when you read the scripture and we don't get the clear idea that's why the gospel of sirama krishna is a panchama veda is very very clear that if one goes again and again through the pages of this book every time you read some new ideas new meaning will come up i am in this life in the householder's life okay no problem you need not to leave but prepare your mind how detaching yourself from the family i am in that family but if i am interested to realize god what i should do i should go out of the family and prepare my mind what is the preparation detachment attachment and detachment surama krishna will come slowly slowly if we follow every word by word you will find why we call him great master the teaching is so wonderful and just like a psychologist to understand the mind and give the way slowly slowly than one person suppose he broke the league and now once again he has repaired and now trying to walk then if you go oh no no your whole life you won't be able to walk now live like that so what will happen to him so then naturally the doctors they go on inspiring oh good you are recovering very fast next day today you have worked 10 steps good very good improvement next day it will be 12 or 15 steps like that they inspired the man sirama krishna is also inspiring these people what broke down in that life of householders so many responsibilities but the god is inspiring them guiding them why should you sad must we denounce the word no why should you a man can realize god even in the war but at the beginning he must paint a few days in solitude he must practice spiritual discipline in a solitary place he should take a room near his house so that he may come home only for his meals see how he is guiding you don't live in that particular building go and hire another and take a rent in another house and then from there just walk and take the food and go back like that sannyasins do that shouldn't sleep in a heart and they will go and collect some food sometimes the rich people they open up at some one place and people sins will go and they will get little simple food and bring it most of the time they'll be reading the scriptures and meditating taking the name of god or singing bhajan like that slowly slowly withdrawing the mind from the world and then they have to withdraw the mind from his own body and mind so that is the second step first step all those people whom we love whom we are attached to it the company we like from them you have to come back and like he is giving them this idea then he says gesha pratap the and others said to me sir we follow the ideal of king janaka he's mentioning the name they are the leaders of the brahma-samaj they are almost the founders of the sadharan brahma-samaj and sirama krishna is attending their function and suramar krishna is among the brahmas but what he's telling he told even the people personalities like keshav and prata pratap chandra majumdar he was the representative of the brahma-samaj in the parliament to religion over here in chicago so you can imagine so these people they are telling to surama krishna said we follow the ideal of king janaka janaka is considered as a king also brahmagyani so he was ruling a country ruling a state and at the same time he was the brahma-gyani that is the the great the condition of the mind mere words don't make a king janaka siram krishna is answering to them i replied mere words don't make a king janaka i replied how many austerities king janaka first had to perform in solitude do something fast then you may become a king janaka the king janaka is known as rajarshi raja king plus rishi the seer the king and at the same time he's a seer so that that is very very rare king janaka was like that but sudama krishna is telling that you cannot simply just because you are also living in the household and at the same time practicing little spirituality giving some lectures writing some articles and you think that you are king janaka it is not the srama krishna is giving the answer like this then he's telling last and gold cannot do any harm to the man who lives in the world after attending god after the realization of the god then there is no attraction of this world the last and gold surama krishna again and again in the gospel if you count so many times he said lost and gold why he said like that because this is the root as in the bhagavad-gita krishna say kama aisha crow the asia they are the enemies enemies of your mind what your desire karma your last your karma and to satisfy that desire you need money and when that money is not there and desire is not satisfied you become angry so the krishna bhagavan sri krishna said that kama and krodha and bhagavan see ramakrishna said it is lost in gold but this is the basis is the loss this is the desire if you are free from that only then can he lead a detached life in the world as king janaka did if you can realize god in the beginning first he said no you need to give up the how to your family life then you can live over there rather you practiced a little but how intense it should be then he said then you should first realize god that is the thing and then you can live in the world he is giving the example of the janaka the janaka was there performing all his duties but he was a realized soul he was only doing his duties that's all but he must be careful at the beginning he must practice spiritual discipline in strict solitude solitude why because when you are living with the people different type of wavelength touches our mind some people will come they will talk in this way they will behave in that way that's why the brahmacharyans they are not supposed to mix with the people not to come in there even in belurum when we joined the one the swami was there at that time to look after us afterwards he became the president of the order swami at mustananda he was in administration assistant general secretary he told us when you were walking when there are so many people in the beluga mart when you were walking try to look at your toe and then go don't look here and there when nobody is there early morning when bellamot is completely free from other people then you go normally meditate but don't go before the devotees and then sit in the temple and meditate no so you will find that of course nowadays because of the corona beluga is completely free the devotee i mean our brahmacaris and swamis must be taking the great spending great time they're all alone so this is the way it goes you should be very very lonely you should be all alone you have to fight with your mind you have to understand where are the weaknesses in your mind sometimes you feel like talking with the people or writing the articles or giving the lecture or getting some money or name fame so many things because the once you join in the order in the world any any faith you are there the the people will come and they will give you so many things as gift so naturally you have to be very very careful in the beginning so surama krishna is telling he must practice spiritual discipline then he is giving an example the people tree when young is fenced around to protect it from the cattle but there is no need for the fence when the trunk grows thick and strong the people tree is a very strong tree so when you are starting your spiritual life you must be humble you must be gentle and when in the every sunday when you are reading the bhagavata how the brahmacharya should leave so that all these instructions are there bhagavan sri krishna he has given all those instructions in the bhagavata that this way a brahmacharya should leave then in the householder's life he should like this so it goes all system but those who are very much interested to realize god for them this restriction is very strongly then there is no harm the last and goal will not be able to harm you in the least if you go home and lead a householder's life after increasing his spiritual strength and developing now he's mentioning developing love for the lotus feet of god through the practice of spiritual discipline in solitude again and again nerijan bars in solitude solitude solitude in the beginning you must learn how to live alone living alone is so difficult now the because of the corona the people are living in their own houses even then they are becoming so restless even in the family the whole family is there but they are restless why i like to go and talk when they were going out maybe there was no friend but still the company of many people in the market in the cinema hall i used to be now that he's alone there are very difficult some people are thinking that some of the young people they're contacting us and they're thinking thinking that they're losing their mental balance depression is coming they are working earning money everything is there but depression why i am alone i am lonely why you feel lonely can't you think that god is there with you so this is the practice we lost that practice the traditional way that the people learn and that is the way one should that's those who are thinking to realize god and pursuing for that so they should practice what the surama krishna is telling live in the house but sometimes be alone at least for three four days and the majority of the time maximum time should be spent in reading the scripture and taking the name of god sometimes when the people they ask we always say make a routine 24 hours out of time 24 hours if you are sleeping for 8 hours only 16 hours are left out of 16 hours 8 hours if you are working nowadays the bosses in the offices they have understood this is good for them they get more work from the staff when they're at home they're going on giving that you should finish this you should finish that and you're in home you're in comfortable way you can finish that means 10 hours 12 hours these people are working if they had to go to the offices eight hours that to one hour will be and the lunch and all that mainly six hours they used to work but now 12 hours they're working so you have to make a routine in the routine that i am going to get up in this then i am doing this and i am doing this if you can make the routine in such a way you will never find that there is time to talk to anyone and one time you should keep in that routine to give a call to your friends and relatives to near and dear ones to chat with them to talk with them sometimes they're singing sometimes reading some good story books and taking the name of god working so like this way 24 hours if you make a routine you will never feel bored you'll never feel that you are alone so that is the only way as a the new world has been coined new normal so this will be the new normal life so we have to practice and better if you take initiation those who are already initiated increase the number of japa and if you are retired people if you don't have the office job ten thousand japan the morning one hour then in the after the eleven o'clock or twelve o'clock one hour then again in the afternoon one hour then in the night one hour four hour you should dedicate for doing the japa and that is exactly what bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling spiritual practice spiritual practice spiritual practice spend at least two hours per study the holy books the spiritual books read the gospel or and then at least one hour listen to the talks of different swamis so when they are giving the talk you are listening then your mind will argue why he is explaining like this it can be like that your brain will be active and moreover whatever you have read when you will listen from them so that will be recapitulation will be there so like that if you make so 10 000 japan means minimum four hours the every 20 minutes 25 minutes one hour like that if you do so 3 000 per hour so four hours into three you are supposed to 12 000 make it 10 000 that is sufficient a little meditation also then reading two hours so six hours listening to the talk one hour seven hour and then listening to the bhajans and singing or you yourself saying recite for him one hour eight hours is gone and that is will be spiritual practice after the retired life if you are doing it eight hours this is a great spiritual practice and you change the mind is completely changing you'll feel great joy if you can do it continuously for one or two months it will be the your practice continue it in the beginning it will break something will happen but try to continue so salamu krishna is giving the advice to the householders that you must go to solitude not that you have to go to some other place and alone you have to no be there because particularly noodle of america things are so calm and quiet everywhere and you get the food you get the medicine you get someone to look after you so that is the way we should try sirama krishna giving the example why is the solitude why you should be alone a man sets milk in a quiet place to cuddle and then he extracts the barter from the curd the yogurt as they say here after once extracting the barter of devotion and knowledge from the milk of the mind if you keep that transformed mind in the water of the world it will float in the world and at taste that is called parabham shabhava so either devotion or knowledge whatever you like but you have to do some karma what is that karma reading the two hours listening one hour meditating four hours repeating the name of god and meditation for our karma so effort will be there karma will be there and your mind is getting purified because you are detaching the mind from the worldly thoughts and worldly objects your mind will get purified the moment your mind get purified the time will come you will get the joy the joy of freedom and the freedom comes from unattachment but if the mind in its unripe state that is to say when it is just like liquid milk is kept in the water of the world then the milk and water will get mixed in that case it will be impossible for the mind to float unattached in the world friends did you notice the suramar krishna he is telling to the householders but at the same time he is telling be unattest with the worldly matters but in the household what is there your responsibilities and that is also worldly thing perform that but at the same time unattached detached so that's why in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna said mom anusmara judacha you remember me and then you go for the fight so mom here take the name of god understand that this is all temporary things one day everything will be over but accordingly you prepare yourself and then plunge into it sometimes some young people they don't like to marry they don't like to go into the householder's life but they are in the working i always advise them always tell them lord whatever you are earning a portion of it you should keep for your future then after the retirement and when you feel that sufficient money has come to support you in in the next then you can retire take the retirement join in some astra spend your own money for the maintenance of your own food and other medicine etc then you are free you are not depending on anyone that complete freedom should be there but from now onwards try to increase your joppa jumper is a wonderful thing taking the name of god repetition of the name of god again and again just mechanically even if we do we are not getting the joy of taking the name of god doesn't matter in the beginning just go on taking that just go on doing that a time will come you will surely understand it the joy of it one of our swamis the he has mentioned he was also after us became the president that he mentioned that someone wrote to him what is the meaning of the mantra then the swami wrote back swami ghana he wrote back very nicely and he said when a baby is crying and calling for the mother does the baby know that the meaning of the mother no the child only know the word mother what is mother it doesn't know but the goes on crying mother mother mother at the time comes mother comes and take the child on her lap that is the goal of the child the what the child will do understanding what is the name of the mother and then who is this mother and what is the how the word mother came the derivative word order is from what he is going to do the child is only crying mother mother and then the goal is to get the mother's attention and then when the mother takes the child on a lap the gold reached your goal is to reach god go on repeating the name of god even if you don't understand the meaning of it because your goal is god and the system to reach there is the mantra this is beautifully swami ghanandhi maharaj he wrote so same way we have to go on taking the name of god live in the world but in order to realize god see in the middle within the in between the commas srama krishna he is mentioning leaving the world but comma in order to realize god comma hold fast to his lotus feet with one hand and with the other do your duties go on re remembering me and perform your duties so the judha means go on doing your duties different type of duties are there sometimes so challenging but you have to go on performing that at the same time taking the name of god when you get a respite from your duties cling to god's lotus feet with both hands live in solitude and meditate on him serve him ceaselessly serbim ceaselessly means whatever the work we do if we are dedicating that to god that is the service of god that means unselfish work do anything that you are doing for the betterment of others and with a clear mind that i am doing it for god then that is the service to god then sub judge joyously because he got that he is happy now he's telling sir these are very beautiful words indeed of course one must practice spiritual discipline in solitude but we forget all about it we think we have become king janaka outright the master and the other devotees laugh i feel very happy and peaceful even to hear that there is no need to give up the world and that god can be realized from home as well so whatever wherever you are whatever the responsibility you are performing you can realize god but the condition you have to detach to your mind from the worldly things and how to detach your mind from the worldly things by practicing spiritual uh the austerities so this is the one two three if we write the anywhere we live either in a householder or a sannyasi we can realize god because that is our real nature so what else we are going to realize our real nature the god is there but right this moment we are confused because of all attachment with the worldly things which are also made of god but just for his own play to distract us from the goal so those who are very clever they should take the guidance from the realized soul like bhagavan sirama krishna sri krishna and then make a a routine that this is the way i am going to i am a monk and my responsibility these are the responsibilities because i'm in an organization so my main thing is to realize god but whatever the responsibility has been given to me i should perform that but then all work that i do i must dedicate it to god now you are a householder when you are performing all the responsibilities but the main thing is god realization and for that you should always remember whatever i am doing these are all temporary things and i am doing because god has kept me over the air to perform so i will sincerely do it but at the end of the day i will dedicate all these at the feet of god so same thing the is not aversion and also the desire attachment it should not be then it is free it is not the place where we live it is the mental attitude that we are having so is guiding so sub judge is very happy then master why should you give up the world again is telling repeating it since you might must fight it is wise for you to fight from a fort you must fight against your sense organs against your hunger and thirst therefore you'll be wise it will be you'll be wise to face the battle from sorry from the world you must fight against your saints organs against your hunger and thoughts therefore you will be wise to face the battle from the world further in the kali yuga the life of a man depends on his food if one day you have nothing to eat then you will forget all about god a man's one said to his wife i am going to leave the world she was a sensible woman she said why should you why should you wonder about if you don't have to knock at the 10 doors for your stomach's sake go but if that is the case then better leave this one place in this one place i am living in this world i am living in the house utilizing the benefit of living in the house all comforts are there food is there salama krishna is telling that utilize that but dedicate your mind at the feet of god that is called bana plus the modern banana pristi life after all the responsibilities of a householder and the people when they are retired the children are all settled so husband and wife they are returned they take the initiation they take the spiritual guidance they read holy books they slowly slowly detach themselves from the worldly things but as because physically fit they go to the temples and do some work over there helping the others also to grow without any attachment or any expectation that is the modern way of the banana prasti as in the bhagavata we are reading the life of the banana prestige so the banana pristines are like these nowadays the main thing is the detachment to the world and when somebody whom you don't know is having something you are not that way hard but those who are very close to you if something happened to them so obviously you are so much attached to them what will happen to my daughter or grandchild if they are like this and like that so you have to slowly withdraw the mind suppose i am not here now suppose i am dead what will happen to them they will survive they can have their own way of surviving think in that way and detach to yourself rather give your time more in the asthmas where you can feel that i am serving the god so this is the way you have to prepare again i say surama krishna is telling why should you give up the world you will find it more convenient at home you won't have to worry about food you may even live with your wife it isn't harmful it is not harmful you will find near at hand all that the body needs at different times when you are ill you will have someone near you to not see you sages like janaka vyasha bashishta lived in the world after attaining knowledge they fained with two swords the one of knowledge and the other of action surama krishna given the example of these people who were the knower of god the bashist he is the guru of sri ramachandra and the ramachandra he was asking and that may be that someday we will study the the yoga vashishta the beautiful way the lord bashed guru bashista is explaining so they were living in the world but they were the man of knowledge and man of realization vyasha we also know of course janaka the janaka vashishta vyasa srama krishna giving the example of these people they were having both knowledge at the same time performing their duties accordingly not shukadeva when he talks about the sannyasins he refers to the shukhadeva the sukkah was a pure sannyasin no responsibilities for the world but his father vyasha he was a householder so naturally he was giving performing all his duties then sub-judge how can we know that we have knowledge he is a lawyer so he is asking the question very categorical question very pertinent question how can we know that we have knowledge here the answer we must note carefully that sometimes we get confused about the spiritual knowledge advaithic knowledge and we make an idea here let us listen what bhagavan sirama krishna said when one has knowledge one does not see god any more at a distance this is the first thing the knowledge means the god over there in the temple the god is there only in a pure place and god is the no so this is the first thing the god is so close to me and second one does not think of him anymore as he he becomes this the he the god becomes this so this become means is transformed he himself become the person become the god so that is exactly what he says then he he is seen in one's own heart god dwells in every man he who seeks god realizes him the first two line how we will know that we have knowledge we will feel that god is always with us we'll never feel that god is only in the temple and nowhere else god is only in the synagogue god is only in the church and the moment we come out of the church so this is our world and inside the church is only god's when we go inside the church we should not tell lies we should not harm others but that's because god is there the moment we come out we can do anything because the god is not there that is not knowledge the knowledge is god is always present and he is present where in the mind it is not he then it is this and then ultimately the what is this god realization that a god realization means self-knowledge that what is this me eternal my body can die as i am changing the clothes i'm changing the bodies and the other people all around that i see is nothing but me as the consciousness so like this knowledge that is a unique way the transformation complete transformation and sometimes the some people they think that oh we are people of knowledge we are man of knowledge and we don't like them because they are devotees they are dualist this is not a sign of knowledge so this bhagavan salam krishna is making it very clear you know in hindi there is a couplet as bhagavan suramar krishna says god dwells in every man he who seeks god realizes him in this couplet it says more it says where you are searching my friend i am is so close to you mato tera pasmo i'm so close to you so near to you if you can really search then you will find me immediately pal varkita lasmo just you search knowing what it is you will find me there what it is consciousness what it is my love what it is my unselfishness so this is the god that is already within me that is there and i am searching god everywhere so transformation is what is called god realization the subject said i am a sinner how can i say that god dwells in me so this is at the concept that we are all humble people the senior very wrong concept we make mistakes but we are not seniors when the children are behaving slowly growing up into a as a becoming a gentleman if you note down how many times the best person in the world when he was very young like a child and growing up to young age and then maturing if you note down how many mistakes he has done so many times and the parents are all other people went on giving them no it's okay but you should not repeat it and rectify rectify rectify so we do mistakes and our worldly parents they are giving us the opportunity to rectify the similarly the god who is the father who is the mother of whole universe won't he give us that opportunity so how can he say that is a sinner eternal damnation what is this eternal damnation how can that be is telling when he asked sir i am a sinner how can i say that god dwells in me that is one trouble with you brahmas sudama krishna is telling that is one trouble with you with you in it is always a scene and seen that is christian view isn't it once a man gave me a bible a part of it was read to me and it was full of that one thing seen and seen one must have such faith that one can say i have uttered the name of god i have repeated the name of rama or hari how can i be a sinner one must have faith in the glory of god's name one must have faith in the glory of god's name so that is the thing i can never be a sinner once i have taken the name of god how can i be a sinner so it is the mistake that you always do and mistake we can always rectify we can correct ourselves so the scene the power is nothing but the selfishness so when we are selfish obviously we were born because of our selfishness because of our desire that we learn that we have to be unselfish have you noticed that the mother will give some food to the child and will ask go and share this with your brothers and sisters with your friends with your other neighbors the child is hesitant he likes to eat the that but then the mother is at the back teaching no you should share and then you eat first you distribute then you eat slowly slowly we learn to be unselfish whatever we have we must share it with others we must enjoy that with others so this is the way the human being slowly develop love understanding unselfishness no question of seeing we were eager to enjoy ourselves then the transformation is coming religion religion is entering into our heart god is manifesting within us and we are becoming unselfish and that is called god realization that is called complete transformation thank you friends i think we should stay leave over here then the sub judge he is asking the question how can one have such faith how can one have such faith answer we will try to listen from sadama krishna in the next mainstay one question the question is from no sorry the question is from srimad is asking if a child does not obey after grown up child is not listening to the mom or father going after now the child is not listening to the parents and that is the but here uh shrimah this is uh the other different different aspect how to control the child how to so the different things are there but here when we are talking about the god we are giving the example so the example the parents are teaching them now okay we can say like this the guru is teaching now suramar krishnadev is teaching but we are not listening to that what will happen we will be left to ourselves and the maximum time it is suffering so what to do now the guru and the god manifested in the human form is coming down as an avatar and giving us the again and again detach yourself learn to live in this world but not of the world and how you should do take the name of god repeat the name of god go to solitude like a mother like a father like a very concerned person when the god is guiding us we don't listen okay we are growing up and
