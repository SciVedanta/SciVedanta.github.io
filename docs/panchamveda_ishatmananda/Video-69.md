[70: Panchama Veda 70: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKRzyUd3zrU)

is the gospel of sri ramakrishna as usual we will recite um last class we were discussing as they were asking questions from suramar krishna is answering now there's a discussion about the incarnation and this one mr kedar and he understood sirama krishna that he is an incarnation of god this is very rare the incarnation of god is very very difficult to understand only very high soul even though he was a householder he understood sirama krishna and we discussed that in the bhagavad-gita also the same way it says it is difficult to understand me and afterwards we find here that sir i have a question that question is very interesting sir i have a question to ask is it good to sacrifice animals before the deity it certainly involves killing he's asking that question and sirama krishna before also he replied that different type of temperamental different type of attitude that has been taken care in the hindu religion and that is the reason some people are there who always think about eating meat and other things for them sacrifice is all right and that also in a prescribed way then sirama krishna is telling answering sastra prescribes sacrifice on special occasions now people they go for hunting just for the fun of it that is not in the sastra in our scripture they are not giving the permission to that but sometimes some places when it is necessary i have seen in the places like the almost like tibet that i went to nepal i saw the nothing is available you cannot think of any vegetable is impossible so what they will do they dry the meat and keep for eating most of them only eating those things and if we complain oh these people are very bad what they will eat how they will survive we have to understand so different type of for those people and then some people they like it and that also they say offer this thing to god and then take the prasad so in one word the ramakrishna is not very much interested to describe or to discuss on this particular topic and he says sastra prescribes and shastra means the opto means the realized souls and the realization not only the god realization also the understanding of the minds of people how they think how they behave different type of approaches are there some people they don't like for them no compulsion that you must have to do nothing some people they like okay with a limited way you must take then sirama krishna he is now discussing as a different in a certain state of mind suramar krishna is discovering about himself in a certain state of mind i see god in all beings look at it in certain state of mind i see god in all beings even in an ant at that time if i see a living being die look at it he is taking the whole discussion in a totally different way and he is giving the description of a mind so which is thinking in a very excellent way and what is that seeing brahman seeing atman seeing god in everything in a certain state of mind not that all the time i see god in all beings even in an ant at that time if i see a living being die i find consolation in the thought that it is the death of the body the soul being beyond life and death unless and until we are detached until and unless we have understood this truth we won't be able to understand this the statement this truth because most of our mind is attached and fully emotional so that is the reason we do not try to understand this and this is the truth so this we have to understand instead of giving the answer to that question in a very thorough way he is telling a certain state of mind i see all beings even in an ant god is existing at that time if i see a living being die i find consolation in the thought that it is the death of the body one should not reason too much now he is mentioning because unnecessarily we discuss we pass our time agitate our mind without coming in conclusion in anything one should not reason too much it is enough if one loves the lotus feet of the mother too much reasoning throws the mind into confusion and he said therefore pray to god for devotion in the mundaku punished we find in the mundukapanishad very clearly it mentions yes mean that is the bridge that leading to the immortality what is that bridge that bridges the knowledge what is that knowledge it says that self alone is one without a second now we get the answer who is sacrificing whom who is giving pain to whom killing whom that is what in gita also sri krishna is telling that you cannot do that so that is the full knowledge but why can't we understand this because our mind is not ready because our mind is not detached and that is the reason know that self alone is that one without a second on which are stung heaven earth interspace mind and the vital forces to gather all the other organs it begins with the dough though means the heaven then the earth antariksa the inter space utam it is attached with it it is all fixed on that on what that atman that is alone and give up all other talks sirama krishna told that one should not reason too much most of the time we'll be having the deliberation deliberation delivered so many places is of course good but at the same time you have to understand so how far we should do that the all people are meeting together and discussing about the religion and what that we have to come together etc and when you come out inside the room it is very good we are all friendly we are talking about the love and respect for each other the moment we come out again we forget and again we think though that was necessary for that time we have sent but my religion my path my decision is perfect or others are wrong but that is the reason long long back in the upanishadic days it says very clearly give up all other talks because this is the bridge to immortality amrita swisha situhu sethu that bridge amrita means immortality so what effort and not only effort you have to get the result the realization so sirama krishna is very much eager to impress people inspire people so that in this life you realize the truth and we find that afterwards he says again and again behind rubber devotion behind reverse devotion there was desire how the description as a discrimination behind druvo's devotion there was desire he practiced austerities to gain his father's kingdom and the two example he is giving classical example dhruva and prahlada now one dhruva he is also praying to god concentrating practicing the austerity austerity means we always talk about austerity austerity means we drawing the mind and other senses from the external object and put that at the feet of god or concentrate that on my object of meditation that is called austerity so this austerity he was practicing for what concentration he was trying he was developing for what for the gain of his father's kingdom we know the story of dhruva but the pralhada the son of hiranyakushipu his father was a demon but still the sun was so good the pralada is a pralada's love for god was motiveless a love that short no return so these are two loves two prayer two practices attitude different this attitude is the main behind reverse devotion there was desire and but prahlada's love for god was motiveless a devotee how can one realize god again the same question is coming and in the pages of the gospel of krishna this question will be repeatedly asked because all of us we are actually confused about god what is god how to realize god what happens after realization what gains i am going to get after realization so all these then suramar krishna he is giving very simple but straight way the reply that kind of love that kind means the prahlada the prahladas kind of love that kind of love but one must force one demand on god this is the specialty of suramar krishna all the time in every place all the spiritual teachers they are all the time giving us that advice that you must be very very careful about god and sirama krishna teaches us you should go and demand to god because you have created me that means you are my father you are my mother and you have the responsibility to look after me why not when one can think in that way when one has the complete faith on god one has developed the love for god i cannot go to somebody else's father and demand but i can go to my mother my mother to my father because i have special relation with my father my mother and i can go and demand so he is telling this one must force one demand on god that means you should develop love and a complete relation with god one should be able to say now he is teaching oh god wilt thou not reveal thyself to me why when you have revealed thyself to so many people so many people have realized you why not me what is the defect in me if there is any defect you have to remove that you have to make me you have to make me correct so that i can realize you so that is the demand then again that another devotee one asked how can one realized god see ramakrishna told this reply and the next another devotee is asking can one see god how one can realize god and this he is asking can one see god look at it everybody is curious and the same question on the same place at the same time they are asking but so patiently answering why because he knows it is so difficult he says yes surely the master masha in the book he mentioned in in italics the surely that means in bold that means giving the emphasis on that he is trying to draw our attention on that particular small word surely yes surely one can see both aspect of god god with form and without form at this moment we do not think that it is very special but if you go through the history of the philosophy you will see particularly the indian philosophy they are fighting thousands of years arguments are going on some people they are trying to say god is without form and some are telling no with form and on this basis only and so many divisions came small small stream they went out from the main body of the hinduism first is buddhism and then came after in the very recent the brahma religion prathanasama brahma samaj prathana samaj arya samaj and so many samaj societies they are going out on the basis of this the god can never have the form because it's all pervading how all-pervading god can have the form but siram krishna categorically is dimensioning but one must yes you can see but one can see both are speaked of god god with form without form why i am mentioning so many times because this is very very important why because some people have the attitude to think that god is formless is okay for you and suramar krishna is telling you can even realize that god without form how he will feel within himself he will listen the divine voice of god it is possible he don't want to see the form of god but he is interested to listen to the voice of god command of god is also possible and one when he thinks that i'd like to see god how in this form or in that form or in that form but this is the specialty of hinduism today one american gentleman came and again this is the so many times i am meeting this american people they're all young people they're curious about religion they're going to the hindu temple because they observe that thousands of people are going to the temples every day so they are curious they like to know what is it not getting the answer is good at least he was telling that when we are going through this way we serve as a society we could understand this is some sort of a religious organization then we found all are welcome they i thought it's okay for me i can go so he came he was sitting over here looking at the picture and then i entered then he followed me he came to my office and he was asking is god is having the form can one take the picture of god like this can one take the picture of god i told yes why not so this way how here again we find god can be directly perceived sadam krishna is giving the answer god can be directly perceived in a man with a tangible form this is again the very very special statement if you the moment you think some people they are so so orthodox sometimes this word is used to maybe that is not a perfect meaning of the orthodox but those who are blind in their faith orthodox this word is now used for that and they think that one should not think of the image of god the moment they are thinking kill them destroy them punish them have no relation with them why what is the harm that they are not thinking so this is the problem the moment you think everything becomes surama krishna is giving us this thing so this is very very important he said yes surely one can see both aspect of god so he didn't stop over here one can see god he understood all these people because mostly they are brahma-samajis so he is giving this idea god with form and without form one can see god with form and the embodiment of spirit again god can be directly perceived as seeing god himself incarnation god can be directly perceived in a man with a tangible form seeing an incarnation of god is the same as seeing himself we can remember the same word that jesus is telling he who has seen me has seen the father see there is no difference that's why cerama krishna is telling roads are different paths are different approaches are different but when you reach to the summit on the top experience same so to just to make him understand i was telling you see a person who is approaching the himalaya at the top of that mountain through nepal is a different path another from the china another from india so the same top they are trying to reach through different path and sometime it is difficult sometime it is all right no but when the reach on the top of that mountain what they see same thing what is their experience same experience so similarly when we are reaching that is the uniqueness of srama krishna and that's why in this modern age he is the only person who is constantly talking about the combination and no differences always combined will find that afterwards how he is behaving when his people are talking about in a different way he who see has seen me has seen the father and sirama krishna said seeing an incarnation of god is the same as seeing god himself god is born on earth as man in every age now age means at different time and some people are very very interested because they have read sirama krishna mentioned after 100 years i will come again and this was asked to many of the swamis also and they said why the god is coming to give us some advices so that we prepare our life and then move in that direction now the recently srama krishna came he passed away only in 1886 now only this not even 200 years and he has given us so many things to understand and to follow and to prepare our life accordingly why not do that by searching for another person and he will be talking in a different fashion different way and that is his job that he will do our duty is to understand at least one and then accordingly make our life and reach to the goal so that is what srama krishna is mentioning and we find that in different places it is supported gavang sarvangajam sheeram the cow is having that milk all over her body gabang but the milk is coming out only from the order tata sarvogatude like that all our devotion to different gods and goddesses they are present pratima surajati but when we see an image it's become very easy for us to concentrate the similarly as the milk is coming from that order similarly from that image of god we can get otherwise it is impossible sometimes some people very ordinary people they can realize and we have seen in the life of jesus christ also the ordinary ladies they realized god they understood jesus is not an ordinary person they understood the divinity in that person whereas many other people particularly those in the name of religion they were shouting and they were claiming that they are religious people they couldn't understand they couldn't see because of the ego that blurred their vision they could not see the truth so this is the srama krsna's life we find chinu sakhari shakarim is a person who is a very very ordinary job that he is doing and his name was chinu when he was the sudama krishna was a small little boy his name was that this person of that village he recognized him he took him to a place and said did puja and said you are god i know but when people will understand it that time i won't be here i will because he is a egypt person but remember i recognized you over here before anyone could do see ramakrishna blessed him so these are the things not that all the time so-called holy people will only see god no is even the ordinary people with a very pure heart they can do that sirama krishna about the janma karma chameleon um sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita said janma and karma it is dibby this is divine why i am born and why i am working it is all divine he who can understand me correctly he is blessed so unless and until our mind is in that level we won't be able to understand once ah some sometime a physicist he will be explaining some of his points those who are not having any basic knowledge of science won't be able to understand anything what he is telling so similarly one cannot understand a religious man unless and until he is or she is having basic thing what is that basic thing purity in heart the purity in heart means unselfishness the moment there is no selfishness there is no ego and when there is no ego mind is clean mind is open mind can get the reflection of god and can understand and here one the british historian the mr dick b of the 19th century he is telling that two person is just mentioning about the browning the poet and john raskin the philosopher when he is comparing with these two with the sirama krishna was totally uneducated so to say he never attended in school he never got any certificate from any educational institution but when this british historian digby comparing with these two great personalities he is mentioning them the gropers in the dark think of it those who understand sirama krishna they can understand it so he is mentioning and roma rolla he mentioned that it is 2 000 years practices of 33 millions of people's religion came in a human form that is sudama krishna so this suramar krishna he is talking with the devotees and that particular day march 11 1883 it was his birthday he was not very much interested of the body but this particular day he was trying to impress people devotees that in a different way indirectly he was disclosing that he is divine it was sirama krishna's birthday many of his disciples and devotees wanted to celebrate the happy occasion at dakshinesha temple garden suramar krishna saw all of them and then said i am glad you have come see when the gods he because god is constantly sending the message you come you come and come because god is the only truth but again the same god he has kept so many hurdles to reach him and there are so many hurdles the name fame this attraction that attraction so all these things covering those things when a person can reach to god he said i am glad you have come when some people having that type of faith the purity and going for god just for love then god is happy one cannot be spiritual sirama krishna is mentioning as long as one has shame hatred or fear these three things lakja greena bhai shame hatred and fear fear means by so ladja grinabhai these three things when one is having what is that whenever there is god's name one must go over there to listen to hear to enjoy to imbibe oh no no there's those peop they are not known to me they have not invited me why should i come no you cannot realize god so that ladja or i don't like those people krina or what people will talk about me some of the ladies they were telling swamiji if i i like to go but my friends they always talk unless and until you are aged you should not go to religious places so think of it the one boy used to come to us as a young boy he was in the college in advaithasana suddenly he was not coming what happened then when i asked him for a long time you are not coming i met him on the somewhere in the street he said my friends they are making cutting jokes making fun of me so i am not feeling good to come to you but secretly i will come when i don't come because unless and until you have the confidence that you are going to a good place when the people are doing bad things they are not ashamed of themselves and when you are doing good things you are going to a good place you are ashamed you need not to come when you understand when you will feel then you are welcome so these are the things i am convinced that these are the very good things that they are doing why should i the ladja grinner boy the shame hatred and fear then sirama krishna is listening to a song he was asking some devotees to sing songs he was very surama krishna was a fond as lover of music so he himself used to sing and he used to ask the devotees also to sing they were singing and after when he was listening to that song you know the specialty again in sri ramakrishna it is not only the tune or the melody but the words the words of that song that touched the heart of course the melody is important the tune is important and the singer if he cannot sing properly even the good words that also one cannot relish enjoy here he he was slowly slowly his mind was withdrawn and then he bowed before the master and the road one person they are giving the description i am skipping some places that's that song particularly after a while kali krishna a person whispered something to bhavanath you know those who have read the biography you know there is a very important character bhagavan and this bhavanath his friend is kali krishna kalish krishna was whispering then he bowed before the master and rose the sirama krishna was surprised he asked where are you going babunath told he is going away on a little business master what is that about bhavanath he's going to the baranagar working mains institute this is a meeting something is there working mains institute he is going then sudama krishna a god is mentioning it is his bad luck a stream of bliss will flow here today he could have enjoyed it but how unlucky see this is the it's not that he wanted people should listen to him but is the truth he got the opportunity he was sitting before god the incarnation and that was the opportunity to receive all the blessings because always you will see particularly not only hindu tradition almost in all traditions they will observe in a great way that particular birthday of incarnation like that why because that particular day and the moment the blessings it comes in a much much bigger way so that anyone coming to that get blessed by that receive that only what we want is a faith and believe and here that person came it was the birthday of sudama krishna he was in such a good mood in a highly spiritual mood and he wanted to blaze the devotees this fellow is leaving so god told how unlucky then he went to kali temple there's a description after bathing master went entered into the temple and then he was worshiping the divine mother but he did not observe any ritual of worship he would offer the flowers and sandal paste at the feet of the image and now he would put them on his own head after finishing the worship in his own way he asked bhavanat to carry the green coconut back to the room here master mahashaya mentioning in very normal way he was offering the flower to mother and again he was offering sudama krishna offering the flower on his own head and he worshipped this picture afterwards and he said when the they arranged to take the picture he was not very much interested but when his beloved disciple narendra nath was forcing no no no we must take because we somehow we got this cameraman and because in those days camera was very very rare and we have collected some money we are paying for it he has come today you must have to see it those who have gone to the dakshinesha they know that there is a the vishnu temple and that barranda he was sitting still those that same floor is there you are sitting on the floor itself and the camera was fixed to him and the moment he was understanding and slowly slowly he went into deep samadhi and the whole body the human body was full with the divine that samskara we can say the impressions expressions manifestation of god and that's why he was not in that body in that body only god was remaining so swami afterwards mentioned when he understood it realized it he said within him the man was dead only god was alive the man means the humanly that those things are totally absent we are only talking about it but it is so difficult for us even to understand intellectually what does it mean but in that afterwards people forgot you know that so many people they will take the photo and afterwards he himself will forget how many photos he has taken and those people he was actually objects of that photograph they will also forget nobody knows where all those thing goes may be deleted and all that but ceramic krishna was very particular he was going on inquiring when the photo is coming when the photo is coming he was going on inquiring and inquiring and calling but in the meantime the photographer they paid him in advance you know in those days and when he was returning back he spend that money so he was not having any other money to develop that because for the development developing that film he has to pay and he was given the advance but advance was spent already and he was trying to avoid narendra and others so as because ramakrishna was very much eager and particular you told that after 10 days it will come it is why it is not coming it is 11 day it is 12 day why not why not then ultimately they went and they he confessed i have already spent it what to do again they gave some money so it was developed they brought it and slowly and it was not very clear it was dirk and so some people they got it one brahmin he got a picture he was not very much connected with cinema krishna but somehow he got the picture he used to keep with him and one day he was leaving dakshineshwar so why to carry suramar krsna's picture so he was thinking whom to give and how to keep this picture mother ma sardamani devi came to know about it and send message you can give the picture to me and he gave siram krishna was not knowing about all this then mother kept it by the side of all other gods and goddesses durga shiva and he she kept sadama krishna's picture also over there but she was not worshiping because the husband a living person you are not supposed to put flower and the girl and and like in a picture when the person is leaving so naturally she was not doing anything one day sudama krishna came to visit it was his habit to see how people are living they must be neat and clean always ready for the spiritual practices so he came to visit that quarter mother used to stay that's called when he entered he saw his own picture then he told oh you have keep kept my picture also with the your gods and goddesses then he himself took some flowers and did the worship and afterwards they composed a wonderful song you have worshipped your own image aponi korele aponar puja you yourself has worship because people won't understand the god the ultimate of the whole thing but in a human form so he did that worship and told mother one day mother was wondering of course and then he declared one day this picture will be worshiped in millions houses and he said this is a very high position of the manifestation of god afterwards masara damani devi she told if one looks at this photo that is sufficient for meditation when you are constantly looking at it that is sufficient for meditation see so easy it has become mother told in one place nowadays sirama krishna has made it so easy to realize god previously people used to do a lot of austerities now only have little faith and the door will be open it is not closed it is not locked it is only hazard only give a little push door will be opened it's not locked and what is that a little faith faith on what in the words of sudama krishna in the words of mash aradamani devi and what is that this is the highest form of the manifestation of god some people they have the habit particularly the indians their habit of making the image stone image this image that image i don't like that personally in the balur mod of course that image because they will be offering the food but that image was made by raja maharaj and when that sculpturist he was making he was of waiting and observing everything every details no no it is not like this you have to make it and then when he completed you know how difficult it is then they found there is a little break or some black mark in that stone it was rejected then afterwards because that person has already made it where to put it so it was taken to kashi if you go to our banaras the asrama you will find that image but belluremot image was made under the watchful eye of our brahmananda ji maharaj he used to meditate on and then used to rectify correct and then this has come is so lively not all can do that not every time it can be so why not keep the photo so always i prefer to keep the photo and photo everywhere because i am carrying my god with me with the faith with a belief only and nothing else and sadama krishna was mentioning and then after coming back that was his birthday but he was taking care of the devotees have you taken food will you eat something now he was asking a young man then he said that one person he was discussing and he was telling the the he is a vedanta he was practici that time he was practicing vedanta he said about the om with kedar he was discussing this eternal word the anahata shabda is ever present both within and without omkara that's true that man without realizing anything just intellectually there he was talking saddam krishna didn't like it so all the time he was very very sincere that you must have the realization only talking only gazing imagining undo so he's always stress worse on this and when the person said this eternal word what is that omkara the anahata shabda it is not actually any shabda any sound it needs two things but omkara it is not having any other thing to make a sound so it's called anahata it's not hit by anything so ana and even present both within and without is correct but cerama krishna is rectifying what is not enough he is telling only omkara ana he said word is not enough there must be something indicated by the word there must be something indicated by the word you are only talking about the word but what is not enough omkara what does it mean there is behind the omkara there is a meaning indication what is that indication so whenever i go to any hindu temple i always try to speak about the symbolism of hinduism they are very good people very devoted and they are here in america they are earning their money but spending for the religion and more devoted and religious and eager to learn about religion than the people i am sorry to say in our own can india because they are busy in other things but here they are not only these but they are intelligent educated well established they could spend their money and time for something else but no they are doing it for religion i appreciate it that's why i always feel because of the ideology of the viewpoint of suramar krishna there must be something tangible behind and here he is mentioning that but the word is not enough there must be something indicated by the world what is that om brahma what is that om om is brahman and what is that brahman all pervading consciousness only the words we know brahman but what is that brahman that we don't bother about all pervading consciousness if go to the any people in the philosophical schools they will recite from the ishvanishan ishaabashyam the last time when i was going to connecticut i was late but even then sometimes the god health i found that one gentleman he called me he was checking to let's call uh what's called uh you know the going inside that checking about the identity card and the boarding pass that check it he called me he said he could read my name it's so difficult even the indians also cannot that american he read swami shatma nanda is it a nepali word or sanskrit word because nepal is now in the year so he acts is a nepali word a sanskrit word i told sanskrit oh then you are a reverend you were a minister i told yes so then i am monk oh monk omkara he said he folded his hand and told omkara i was wondering how could you know it then he was showing i i know it so and of course there is so much time you pick people came in the behind the cue so he said umkara at long god but the word what is the behind brahman what is that brahman all-pervading consciousness the moment you say that it is all-pervading consciousness you cannot hate anyone you cannot criticize anyone you cannot heart anyone that is the thing simply brahman means all pervading that won't do so this is the specialty of srama krishna then he was telling to kedar do you know and he said oh don't you understand when he said omit brahma then he took kedar because kedar was a devoted devotee and he was telling oh don't you understand he upholds the doctrine of the rishis of the old end times because rishis followed the path of gyana therefore they shot to realize brahman then ramakrishna is mentioning the short to realize brahman the indivisible existence knowledge please absolute look at it he never read any book but he knew each and every word and he knew when to use how to use sat chit ananda saruba that is brahman sat eternal cheat knowledge ananda please eternal absolute but those who follow the path of devotion again is coming back to devotion because he is understanding that these people even if they talk about knowledge because the brahma the that that society was there brahma society they always used to talk about brahman without any form and all these things only they were talking they are not realizing anything so sudama krishna is interested to help people to understand things whether through knowledge or through devotion doesn't matter but at this stage it is better for you to follow the path of devotion bhakti but those who follow the path of devotion seek an incarnation of god he is giving that hint here is an incarnation of god just before you if you have that knowledge the faith you get the benefit why unnecessarily you are knocking your head here and there and groping in darkness when the god is ready in the human form just before you but unfortunate they could not understand it to enjoy the sweetness of bhakti ordinary people do not recognize the advent of an incarnation of god he comes in secret only a few of his intimate disciples can recognize him then he giving the example rama was both brahman absolute when we chant the ram nam the very first word that we uttered should the brahma parat para ram but do we understand the meaning of it should the pure what is that purity complete unselfishness brahma all pervading consciousness and then para opera is everywhere all pervading should the brahma-parapararam the rama was both brahman absolute and perfect incarnation of god in human form but was known only to 12 rishis only 12 people could recognize other sages said to him rama we know you as the shadow son and they were identifying rama as a son of the sharatha they could not see rama behind he was accepted because he was a prince and dasharatha particularly we think only ayada no his kingdom was sprayed up to the middle east and then down to bengal it's a huge kingdom but their capital was ayotta and in those days not much of showing off so they were just like ordinary people in a simple house they used to leave so that this son but the sharatha was a very powerful king people knew him can anyone comprehend brahman he is asking it is very very difficult friends next next again um tuesday we will discuss about this sirama krishna is talking about the brahman now today we conclude by offering our pranam to this holy personality bhagavan srirama krishna niranjanam nityam me krishna on do
