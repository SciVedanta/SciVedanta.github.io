[309. Panchama Veda 309 - “ Live in the World in a Spirit of Detachment.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E45_-f3VJ_c)

their devotees and friends and this wednesday we will start studying the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavan si ramakrishna let us begin with this mantra now last two wednesdays we were reading and discussing about the nithya that is the permanent the empirical and lila that is temporary phenomenal state this is very unique condition this is the first time we came to know about it a person who was in both sides sometimes in the empirical with us in this world in this pheno and sometimes sometimes with the god and sometimes with the human being sometimes in the empirical sometimes with the phenomenal there is something very unique that is bhagavan sirama krishna and he's standing as a bridge even showing us that this is possible when you note something through our senses an object when we know through the senses and that is called phenomena and that is temporary that is lila sanskrit word leela means all temporary things now everything that we see in this world through our senses only we see we hear we touch we taste we smell these are the five organs that we use and all the objects whatever we see varieties of objects but only these five so that whenever we are experiencing we are actually experiencing the leela lila these temporary things but behind this there is something permanent whenever there is something temporary and we can understand this is temporary and our experiences says everything is changing naturally it is temporary the water of the water the river is constantly flowing we know this is temporary the water that we took from the river is not the same water it be again if we take from the same river the knot is not that is not the same water so naturally we can understand everything is changing changing and changing we look at the the album of a family album and we go to our grandfather grandmother father mother then me so like these it is going on changing we can understand that about this this world phenomenal world this changing world the leela we have the experience we have the idea but the problem is we take it as permanent though we see everything changing but somehow we don't like to accept it and that is called maya the maya the word that the viranthin they have used the maya and that is the beauty of the maya wherefrom it came they say it is the power of god bewildering people we see things are changing but we don't believe it we don't like to accept it we think that that is permanent pages after pages of the history of the human history is telling about the leela the temporary things kings after kings came so many things happened in our personal life also happened we see every moment things are changing well ask yourself do you like to say that this is changing somewhere at the back of the mind you always like to say oh this is permanent i understand this is part for me it is permanent though it is going to change myself when i go and look at the the mirror stand before the mirror i never can think that i am going to die can anyone that is called maya something is constantly be fooling us bewildering us and we have to fight we have to remove that condition of our mind and that is called spirituality the process of removing the ignorance the vedanta will say a gyana a gyana means ignorance what is that ignorance it is temporary but still i don't like to accept it as temporary that is again when we remove that then what remains is called permanent and that is nithya sanskrit nithya means permanent it never changes and obviously we know when we can understand the change there must be something static comparing with that only we can understand so this what bhagavan suramar krishna he showed us in his own life that sometimes some great soul they went into samadhi came back and they gave us the teachings and we accepted that there are so many great teachers are there in the world but this is here we find someone sitting in our drawing room and he is taking us to that nithya eternal just before us he was talking and having fun eating just like us suddenly he says i can't see you somewhere else when you go and touch we don't feel that he is leaving where has he gone the man was here now where is he he before everyone day time night time in calcutta in dakshinesha everywhere he is just going to the other world and coming back that is the reason this is the eunuch in the history of the spiritual world truly unique never never happened so swami vivekananda said she is the greatest among all these divine teachers and we are reading only a few conversation when the teacher with our master mahajay he used to come to him and whenever whatever he said he noted it down that has come down to us as the gospel of sri ramakrishna and this panchama veda as i say like to say love to say because everything is so truth it's all knowledge and this page that we are reading 744 of the gospel of sirama krishna by translated by swami nikhilananda so here what we find and sometimes some people original book that bengali that is page 7 9 seven that uh total the bengali kathamrita 797 and this is 744 to 747 will go and now he said about the nitta and the leela and when you understand the nitta still living in the leela when you realize understand and completely transform yourself into that permanent world permanent existence but still you are living physically in this temporary world what is that condition shankaracharya said that is jivan mukta abastha the jivan means the leaving mukta is liberated liberated from where from the ignorance and what is that ignorance every temporary thing we accept or like to accept or believe as permanent that is ignorance it is not ignorance about the days that oh he doesn't know he's an ignorant fellow ignorant person not like that here the ignorance means he doesn't have the idea about the permanent so when he knows it or she knows it a person knows it but at the same time living in this world like an ordinary person he's called jivanamukta and in our last discourse we discussed about it the jivana muktavastha that is the uniqueness sometimes after meditation we realize it and we after the realization there is so much of joy and we don't like to live in this world because that is all nasty so most of the people after realizing the truth they like to give up the body they don't like to eat they don't don't like to maintain the body physical things so they die because of the joy and for us again when the moment we talk about the death we are afraid oh my god after god's realization we are going to die we don't need god realization again foolishness again ignorance again agayana again maya because it is the joy the eternal joy the permanent joy the permanent happiness which has been termed as bliss so when you get that you get everything but some people they can maintain both even after that they remain in this world to help others after reaching the destination some people they come back and then they become guide of the others and help them to go up to the summit themselves went in a difficult path and went on the top of the hill the mount everest and then they came back and opened the school and asked taught other people the technique to reach over there and to get the joy of reaching on the the the top of the world so that way the jivan mukta is like but how we will know who is a jiban mukta shankaracharya as we already read he said that yeshua's he said 428 words of the bible we mentioned in our last class i am repeating yes how you will know that person is a jivan mukta he is pragya his knowledge is form he's not going to be bewildered no temptation can sway his decision nothing his pragya his knowledge his intellect has realized the truth he knows it friends i was in andaman many of you know many times i remember that those days i was there for eight years i was in arunachal pradesh a part of of course in arunachal pradesh that is called naratam nagar the district is called tirap i was there for 12 years i know how those people are their culture at least to a great extent i know obviously 12 long years eight long years i was there i know how those things were of course slowly slowly changes but basic things are there i can understand now those who have never visited andaman that island are that arunachal pradesh the place i was lived and if they go on telling or writing books about that place just imagining or reading some here and there some notes how can i accept that so obviously i'm when they say you know what happened in andaman that there are tigers there are these and there are that so i'm not going to accept it sometimes some people they used to say oh innandaman you were there and there were people who eat the human fleshes like that the neighbor but anyway if you like to make a story and the movie that is all right but i am not going to accept that because i lived over there so they can never make me convinced about their false imaginary things why because i realized that a jivan mukta is just like that a jivan mukta he lived with the brahman he realized brahman he know the what is brahman now willingly he is living in in this temporary world and which is to us who has not realized brahman is a very happy place and we will be giving him the description have you visited that place oh it is so wonderful and have you visited that national park oh it is so beautiful the best in the world they will say but that man will smile and so is it so that's good let us go but for him just he's going and seeing but he's not getting convinced with that because the happiness he knows so shankara is telling giving that he is telling yeshua stita bhavit pragyan whose pragya is strongly anchored on that spiritual experience second yeshua ananda nirantara you're always happy always happy never unhappy in any situation he is very happy when swami vivekananda's famous vivekananda some people used to criticize him but he used to enjoy with that also oh you either you have to appreciate me or you have to criticize me but you cannot ignore me by that way used to say like that he never cared about those things why he knew the truth these people are simply saying something it doesn't matter anything he has seen he has realized ananda the joy the happiness is eternal and for that this person is not depending on anything and thirdly prabhanja bismitha praya and he forgets about the existence of this world what to talk about the beauty the will the power nothing he forgave that as we forget that in our deep sleep when a king is sleeping in the deep sleep and the beggar is sleeping in his deep sleep both the same they don't know the difference maybe they are sleeping side by side something happened the king and the beggar if by chance they come together and they're sleeping side by side they won't know who is a king and who is the bigger same way a realized soul he will be living with us but he is not going to accept these world as permanent so that is prapancha bismita why the human birth only to achieve that strive for that you must learn that and today friends bhagavan si rama krishna is going to teach us the technique to reach into that condition sirama krishna is the amritasya [Music] here's a beautiful word from the upanishad and it says it is a bridge between this phenomenal world and empirical world nitya and leela are connected through we have heard about the nitya oh god is there he is permanent he never gets any changes the brahman is eternal we read we hear but we don't have any experience but when we go to bhagavan sirama krishna look at his life read his biography authentic biography is there his direct disciples they have written about him then we feel oh that must be there so he becomes the bridge and we think start thinking we can also cross this is a wavy because this life is full of misery and sometimes it is just flash some of the joy is coming some people are appreciating me some people are just praising me i feel so happy so joy and i am an actor i'm a singer i'm a successful administrator i'm a successful businessman and successful player somewhere in some thing i am playing and the moment the success comes we become very happy or life is so happy but again [Music] all those objects through which i was getting the joy goes away sleeps away but even if i don't like to lose those they always go away there's a people never like to share their wealth and ultimately even if they don't want they have to they have to leave all alone they came alone they have to leave they cannot take anything from this world and that is true truth for the king and truth for the the beggar but we don't like to believe it that ignorance we have to overcome then only we can cross this bridge and reach to the amrit what is this amrit chivan mukta condition that is the amrita now bhagavan sirama krishna is now teaching today the technique i practiced all sorts of sadhana he's telling i practiced all shots of sadhana during my sadhana period i had all kinds of amazing visions i distinctly perceived the communion of atman distinctly perceived the communion of the atman so that is the unique condition friends now meditation is a another is a very popular world each and everyone all over the world little educated people all are talking about the meditation even sometimes in the army and the disciplined forces also they're practicing meditation because so much of the business organizations are also teaching meditation through naturally meditation teachers are coming they are also teaching different type of techniques are coming so that is okay that's all commercial thing that is happening if the people get some benefit is okay but what is the purpose of meditation the purpose of meditation is not just to calm your mind and then again with that calm mind you can plunge into the business and get a good the prophet no that is not the purpose of meditation purpose of meditation is to go beyond the bondage of desire that is the purpose of meditation so bhagavan srama krishna when he's teaching us the meditation when he's hinting about his sadhana his spiritual practices it is that and he's telling during my sadhana period i had all kinds of amazing visions please remember those who have not read the bhai guru pray of srama krishna they may by mistake think or the egoistic person talking about him he may say oh that that i have had the vision most of the people they talk like that krishna was not like that he could not even say i so this body he was not at all associated it was so difficult for him to associate with this body i don't know whether how many of us will be able to understand this because we means i means you means this body only nothing else swami shatman under this body and mr suh and so this dead body and miso and so that body so this is only body and the name and that form we are so much attention to that it is so difficult for us to understand when someone says i can't understand this arjuna in the bhagavad-gita if you read you will find in one place he is praising krishna because he understood that point and said i now believe you why because you are telling that you are such he's selling krishna all these years used to think krishna is his friend but the time came he realized the person who is moving with me talking with me living with me making fun with me he is not my just friend he is the god of this universe in human form about him all the great teachers they are giving the statements that is all right but i believe o krishna because you said it why because you are not ordinary person you don't have any desire you don't have any ego so when you say these that you are so and so i believe it that's a great realization not everybody is talking about these i am these i am that everybody is beating their own drums it is not that so we have to at least that intelligence we should have to understand the genuine people and the fake people so obviously when bhagavan sirama krishna is telling during my sadhana i had all kinds of amazing visions is a completely different thing different statement and why he is telling this he himself will ask this question and give the answer he's saying this telling this so that we can understand i distinctly perceive the commune of atman atman is there brahman is there god is there jehovah is there buddha is there it is possible to realize possible to understand so that is the why he is telling it atman is there this is the self and self is completely different from this body not the mind also mind is the subtlest thing of all this our personality we have the body we have the other things also the chakshu karna nashika jiva all subtle things are there but the subtlest thing is the mind is so powerful mana so jabil when they're in in the upanishad they say what is this atman the mind is the fastest thing in this world anything much much faster than the light and it travels in such a fast way i'm sitting over here in a flash my mind goes to any country any place anywhere in the world any moment it can reach over there so fast it is but those who have realized the atman they will say mind goes and sees over their what utman only without the atman mind cannot function the moment your mind is functioning means atman is already there so that atman manaso jabil it is a faster than the mind and sudama krishna says i have seen the dartmouth the communion with the atman i've realized that atman when i meditated during my sadhana i used to think of the unflickering flame of a lamb set in the windless place that's when the mind must be withdrawn from all the objects sense objects again and again in vedanta you will come to this in the in the in the in the indian music they always call soom it is the they will go in the seven different tunes are there and then they will come back to the zero and that is called soma and in indian spirituality again and again they will come to this to make you understand this pancha the five saints organs the eye the tongue the nose the ear the skin they are going out and collecting information that is called ahara that is the food food of the mind now sometimes we make mistake the moment we say food we think eatable just that we can taste of course that is but it is all the five when you see when you hear when you smell when you touch that is also the information that is also the ahara that is also the collection ahara means collection but that is the food of the mind and with those food the mind is becoming so mad so obviously this mind cannot because it is changing this mind cannot be atman the atman is completely different from the mind and mind is not atman so that in the vedanta again and again they will try to make us understand that point most of the time even some of the european uh the philosophers they took mind as the final word no it is the atman in deep meditation a man is not at all conscious of the outer world if you have taken initiation you must be knowing that the most of our gurus the ramakrishna mission teachers they say that you have to come out of your body and see your body as a temple and your chosen ideal ishta devata or the devi easter means chosen and that god or goddess is sitting inside your heart facing towards that where you are facing that means you have to forget your body and you have to come out and then you have to look at yourself that is meditation you have to forget yourself also i am not this body and forget about the other things where i am sitting the room the road the vehicles the sound everything you have to forget and that is called meditation and this is not a sleep and when you go into deep sleep same thing happen but there we are not conscious unconsciously we are reaching over there so when we get up and is the same old person but when you meditate consciously withdrawing your senses from the saints objects becoming one pointed going to somewhere where there is nothing but the consciousness and when you come back from that you are buddha so that gotama who sat under a people tree and he was withdrawing his saints organs from the saints objects entered into the realm of knowledge and when he got up from the deep meditation he was no more gotama he was the buddha the knower of the truth this that is called meditation and that is the purpose of meditation and bhagavan sirama krishna is teaching us that meditation so we have to fight with our mind which is always tempted to go and enjoy the saints objects and these sense objects have been created by maya and the maya is nothing but illusion but we accept that as permanent again when we accept that something which is not true it's just apparent standing over there sitting over and we think oh this is permanent so many different ways the vedantic have tried to give the example there is a prism it's all just transparent and some red color has been kept at the back of the prison and when you look through the prism we see this red prism is it no take out the red color it is only nothing no color is there you put any color you will see that the world is just like that so this is the way we have to understand but who will be interested those who have understood the futility of this world they were successful people but then they understood the futility of it those who have just started their human life of course they will be happy to get some enjoyment let them enjoy the one should not disturb them it says like that in the bhagavad-gita don't disturb them they like to enjoy it's okay but only guide them because we love them they will suffer if they are accepting that as a permanent they'll be suffering and nothing else so similarly we have to the the spiritual teachers those who have truly realized it in their own life then they can go and say see look at this be careful you like to enjoy enjoy but with a little control with a control if you enjoy it's nothing it's okay so that is the way and bhagavan sirama krishna is telling that you have to withdraw your senses this all my whole mind should be completely still you have to kill the mind in the uh in our the great teacher yoga bashishta the guru bashir he is telling to his disciples and kill the mind that means still the mind that means there should not be any function of the mind he used that very strong word killing and people are all oh no no there should not be any killing so it is not killing means you have to completely forget the external world there shouldn't be any modifications what is mind nothing but modifications it goes on thinking now you have to still the mind there should not be any wave and when how the wave creates when there is a wind and what is the wind nothing but the desire so the desire which is actually like the winds are creating waves on the water of our mind that has to be stopped so he says in deep meditation a man is not at all conscious of the outer world a person can achieve such single-mindedness in meditation that he will see nothing hear nothing he will not be conscious even of touch in deep meditation the saints organs stop functioning in deep meditation the saints organs stop functioning the mind does not look outward it is like closing the gate of the outer coat in a house there are five objects of the senses form taste smell touch and sound they are all left outside puncher punch means five the puncher the sense organs that first is the i and when i i what what what is the function of the eye to see the form it goes and sees a flower the flower is red and it is beautiful it has the petals the form it is reporting to the mind taste is a tongue and then smell the nose touch is our when our the skin is mainly the hand we can say is touching and the sound is the ear so this is the way the five organs constantly collecting information of the external world what are those objects temporary again i am repeating this word again and again to bring that truth home that these things are actually not there we are imagining we are thinking and we are enjoying there's nothing to enjoy over there suramar krishna will be giving us the the description what is this and he will say at the beginning of meditation the objects of the senses appear before the aspirant but when the meditation becomes deep they no longer bother him they are left outside how many things i saw during meditation i vividly perceived before me a heap of rupees rupees indian coin in rupees a swall a plate of sweets and women with rings in their noses what do you want i asked my mind do you want to enjoy any of these things no replied the mind i don't want any of them i don't want anything but the lotus feet of god i saw the inside and outside of a body as one sees from outside the articles of a glass room i saw what is in them the entrails the blood the filth the worms all such things so what is in the body in the biblic choramine also shankaracharya describing the human body and so vivid but still the doctors they are regularly opening the body at the time of studying the medicine they are segregating they are practicing all those every day they are studying they know what is there the bones and marrows and all these things are in the body but still there are some doctors who are so much attached to those bodies why again maya though we know that they are not so good only a skin is covering all the filth but still we are so much tempted to those bodies why maya so friends we have to understand these those who have understood these they will slowly withdraw their mind from the attachment to these bodies and along with the body there is name the fame and the the physical comforts the wealth all that will go and that is called these are the two great words for the spiritual aspirants not for all those who like to enjoy let them enjoy please enjoy but when you will understand then come to bhagavan srirama krishna and hold his hand and start moving towards the spirituality and you will the first thing you have to understand all these things in the world are temporary what we see is not true like the body that we see and we get attracted just because of one lady the whole the country was destroyed the iliad odyssey of those stories when you read the one queen was there just for dhar the whole race was destroyed two groups of people they fought only for that and then the what was the main thing ego oh we have to go and we are powerful the all people they went and they died over there they killed also for what where is that queen nowhere maybe if you in the some people they may find somewhere as something of that as a historical evidence nothing is there just open the history book you see the things are happening for the wealth and for this type of the enjoyment it is only killing and all this merciless thing happening but those who are doing they are thinking they are doing great things historians are also writing about them oh he killed one million people he was a great powerful warrior what is this so like that only if we can understand then you have understood the futility of this world then bhagavan srirama krsna's gospel of sadama krishna will be a great guidebook for you that's why when we are reading this your words oh lord are just like the amrit like the drop of nectar to whom those who understood this so people unnecessarily they're wasting their energy and time for all this thing but go and talk to them they won't believe they're so much engrossed into that they are thinking that i am going to have that after me my son will pursue but for what i was chasing my shadow i could not catch my shadow no problem my son will continue the search he will run after his own shadow like these we are going on and we are thinking we are doing great thing in this world what is spirituality understanding this and that is called be baker understanding these the when you can understand what the give up that and when you give up it is a negative okay i give up and against that what i get you get the nectar amrit and what is that amrit joy the please how can you get that because now you are standing on truth you realize the truth the bhagavan srama krishna is going on people of small intellect seek occurred power why he said that because gidis girish chandra ghosh he used to say now and then that he could cure illness by the strength of the master's name some people they like to have that of course it is possible if you can that if you have the faith and occult is it is possible but sunam krishna never liked it never appreciated it when the girish was tailing at that time suramar krishna was alive he was there but girish has great faith in the name of krishna he knew he felt he understood he realized that suramar krishna is nothing but god and that god's name and god are inseparable and if you take the name of god with great faith god's grace will surely come to you that is the way it works so girish used to say like that but siram krishna didn't like that that is also temporary now i am suffering so i go to someone and then he will be uttering the name of god and touching me and my the headache is gone my the ache is gone then i am for how long again the whole body will die someday so why should i have to use all those for a temporary period of time ah that is okay either today or tomorrow i am going to die that is for certain maybe i will leave another 20 years is okay maybe i am not that is also okay this is all same and that is called the courage it is not that i go and kill some people innocent people that is not the courage courage is this understanding the truth of the futility of the world you were always ready to go beyond the death fear of death friends this is telling like this people of small intellect sick occult powers but the genuine devotee of god don't want anything except his lotus feet the moment he will hear that someone can touch you and can heal you there will be a great like you there will be line so many people educated scientists professors maybe the doctors are also there why oh if you go then he will touch with his right hand on your head and everything will be over for how long and if you observe that person is going to hospital to the doctors for his or her cure why so this we should not go for that no occult thing we should go now how many other visions i saw while meditating during my sadhana sirama krishna is mentioning once i was meditating under a bill tree when sin the papa appeared before me and tempted me in various ways he came to me in the form of an english soldier and different form they come what is this sin in the temptation jesus tempted there's a movie that i saw long back the scene appeared before the jesus when he was getting the the the people were punishing him the king up there then he appeared before the jesus and said look at me i can give you the comfort i can protect you but your father in heaven the god could not protect you you're suffering they're flogging you why don't you come to me i will give the protection the jesus looked at that person that the devil and then somehow god happens asks those people to flog again so no temptation i know that god is truth and this body all this comfort all this name everything will go away now where is that king who punished the jesus where are those people who kill those jesus that jesus is eternal that is called amrit it's not the liquid that i eat or drink and then immediately might this body become permanent not like that eternal means i am surviving surviving in the minds of the millions of people all through that is called that this is our mahabhi ranumanji he lives eternally that means the spirit of that he says he was tempting he wanted to give me wealth honor sex pleasure various occult power and such thing i began to pray to the divine mother now i am telling you something very secret the mother appeared i said to her kill him mother i still remember that form of the mother her world beswitching beauty she came to me taking the form of krishnamuy krishnamuri is the younger daughter of the balaram bush the scene came in the form of a british soldier english soldier and the mother came in the form of a krishnamay the daughter of the balaram bush but it was as if her glance moved the world so that is the vision he saw sudama krishna became silent resuming his reminiscences he said how many other visions i saw but i am not permitted to tell them someone is shutting my mouth as it were i used to find no distinction between the sacred tulsi and the insignificant sajna leave the feeling of the distinction was entirely destroyed what is the spiritual realization these samadar shittu those who claim that they are spiritual people should understand that veda should they need not to tell the world they should go stand before a mirror and ask themselves have they truly developed this samadhar shitwa same sightedness have the desire for the worldly name fame physical comfort then still long way to go long way to go we cannot deceive ourselves we can deceive the world but we cannot deceive ourselves and neither we can deceive the god so instead of telling the other people oh i am a religious man and i have these and that instead this is the way we have to once i was meditating under the banyan when i was shown as a muslim muslim man with a long beard he came to me with the rice in an earthen plate he fades some other muslims with his eyes and also gave me a few grains to eat the mother showed me that there exists only one and not two it is sachidananda alone that has taken all these various forms he alone has become the world and it's living beings again it is he who has become food this is vedanta when you talk about vedanta when you talk about hinduism hinduism is nothing but vedanta hinduism talks only about the one and no two a true hindu a devout hindu can never find distinction between these and that is not possible those who are in the society according to the condition of the society according to the condition of the politics the economical situation political situation they may behave of course they have the right to protect themselves they must do that but when they talk about religion when they say that i am killing that person in the name of hinduism that is wrong no i am fighting with that person because i felt that he is going to kill me or destroy my family i have every right to fight back of course you can but as a religion those who are followers of ramakrishna mission or the rasri bhagavan si ramakrishna the true followers of spirituality religion they should understand this there is only one without two and bhagavan si ramakrishna is speaking about the scene came in the form of someone and the muslim came and he was distributing the food from his own plate and they gave that food to sadama krishna too and the mother showed him there is no distinction from the narrow social political economical view we should not explain this we have to go beyond all these little small things and from the eternal perspective of the spirituality which will be there when even when the whole world will be destroyed that truth will remain that is spirituality to girish aim and others i have the nature of a child and hiday said to me uncle asked the mother for some occult power and i went to the temple and asked the mother he was telling the mother scolded him and showed him a very bad scene that this is called occult power you want that sirama krishna and he was having all the power he was the god himself the obviously then the master to the aim suramar krishna is telling the aim the writer well have i done any wrong in telling these secret experiences he's asking am i beating my own drum oh i had these i had that this experience has experience aim did not know what to say and kept quiet the master he himself replied why should there be any harm why should there be any harm in it i have told these things to create faith in you all that is the purpose when these great personalities those who have no ego at all is talking about them it is not just to the saying something about himself to make himself great or patting his own back no is to encourage us so that we can understand the master masha hesitating after the while he said to aim very humbly will you kindly bring him here here means the poorna the young boy master he said yes sir i shall sing for him this very moment that then the master ramakrishna is telling that in purna i have reached the post i have reached the post master understood what he meant post means was krishna hinting that purna was perhaps the last devotee of his inner circle so that is ramakrishna then described to girish aim and other devotees his own experience of mahabharata so we will continue you know friends that we will be discussing about a little from the uh our patanjal jagu darshan also in the meditation what are the hindrances that's called panchaklisha so as the time is not there so we will rather discuss it in the next but i will just mention these because the today's topic leave in the world in a spirit of detachment live in the world in a spirit of detachment not that you have to leave the heart and home some people they become monks and when you look at them we think oh they are very happy and some people they wear the gerua clothes now it is available in the shops they give you a clad a color a saffron color they put on that cloth and take the photo and give it to that is good they have the love for this but what actually this color mean is giving up what we are giving up ego is not the home it is not the money it is not the position it is not the any other thing oh i should not eat these i should not go there nothing like that only when do you don't have the ego automatically it will be done we will continue so suramar krishna taught us living the world but with the spirit of detachment so is there any question shiva ratna kumari she has a two-part question the first part is i have a question regarding understanding our duties and responsibilities as we become more and more detached we tend to lose interest in doing anything in the world second part can you please tell us how we can should perform duties with complete involvement yet with detachment shiva kumari that is the technique that is the sadhana that is the spiritual practice we have to uh perform is a very good question that you have asked while living in the world understanding the futility of the world the temporariness of the world but still performing whatever the responsibility and the duties we have taken up with all just with all interest but inside the test we know it is not actually true now what will happen you know that suppose you have done something and some people are not appreciating you for that you won't feel any heart oh that's okay that was my duty i have done that that's all so srirama we always say i offer whatever we have done we operate at the feet of the lord forget about that there is a practice just one day we cannot do that it's a practice but it's a very good idea you need not to give up whatever the responsibility you must perform and perform with the spirit of detachment and you need not to announce that hey i am taking the classes i am a professor though but i am completely detached you need not to announce in that way inside internally constantly you should say i am performing my duty in the best possible way that i can do but i am not attached to it thank you okay so with the two parts you said what do you want first of all i was getting more and more detached and was losing interest oh no no you should not lose interest the more you are more you are involved into the spiritual life the more you understand that this is the best thing in the world more you start loving others caring for others so you should not feel like that thank you let us conclude by altering this mantra [Music] is [Music] namaste [Music] you
