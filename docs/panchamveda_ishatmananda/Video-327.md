[328. One Needs Sadhana to Realize God - Panchama Veda(328)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvNQbciow2g)

their devotees and friends so this wednesday the last wednesday of this month so we will study the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavansi ramakrishna now i usually study the translated by xiaomi nikhila nandaji published from the new york center and you can follow that and the page is 779 so let us begin with this mantra a friends those who are regularly following you know bhagavan sirama krishna was visiting ramachandra datta's house it was in north calcutta ram chandra dhatu was a doctor and he could provide this and not only accommodation but some food also for the devotees we used to assemble and the situation and there was a turmoil that period because it was the britishers were ruling and they were controlling the indian society and indian society was thoroughly confused what to do because shall we politically it was all right but what about the religion and society because that new type of religion they were trying to spread a new type of system so the confusion was there now as all hindu they believe whenever there is this type of challenges when the righteousness is in low so god himself come to help to establish the religion and we believe that the god himself came in the form of bhagavan srirama krishna bhagavan means the lord himself the god himself and this suramar krishna he is establishing dharma style dharma swami vivekananda is giving the introducing bhagavan si ramakrishna in the form of a pranam mantra so who is this ramakrishna he is establishing the dharma the righteousness how is a conversation that is very unique in the modern times it was not necessary anything else and he was in calcutta didn't the capital of the india ruled by the britishers and the cross currents of thoughts shall we follow the traditional way shall we accept the new path shall we do this because india's civilization india's culture is so ancient so it's very difficult to suddenly to uproot it or change it in that turmoil when the people were confused what to do and what not to do and there was no freedom even to express so this time the lord came in the form of suramar krishna and he was so humble so gentle but he was the proof of religion that is the uniqueness he used to go to house to house usually the monks they are not supposed to go to householders when the traditions they say but here we find the god is going to each and every house those who were good people and he used to go over there and whenever he used to visit that and immediately some other people they will be coming and sitting and discussing the whole gospel of krishna we find a description sirama krishna visiting this place his house that house and sometimes the people will be visiting him at dakshinesha also and he will be talking and what he is actually doing to establish the religion giving a clear complete idea about the religion and transforming the minds of the people all wrong notions about religion all wrong notions about the practice of religion all he is removing by giving wonderful advices and at the same time he is giving the courses also that today we are reading and luckily the one teacher mahindranath gupta he was an excellent person and his memory was photogenic memory whatever he heard he saw he remembered and he used to note it and when he used to go back to his home he will be all rewriting that and keep it all ready so like maintaining the diary and by that way he kept all this not the whole the lifetime of sri ramakrishna only a few years when the master marshall met him now this is 1885 1886 srama krishna will give up the body 1885 may 23rd it is saturday and he was meeting the devotees at the house of ram chandra datta so master masha has written and in the english book is mentioning 41 chapter at ram's house srama krishna meeting and we are we were reading the last time also we read from here and today we will be reading from the page 779 the ramakrishna is mentioning one needs sadhana is a sanskrit word written in english one needs sadhana mere study of the scripture will not do and then he said what will mere study accomplish and this is very very important when we are truly trying to realize god now if you like to prove your scholarship and scholars scholarly way of presentation of course you have to study different type of books quoting from this person quoting from that person and varieties of books that people are publishing majority of them i am sorry to say do not follow what they write or what they say now from those books you may get some satisfactions intellectually but spiritual benefit no no no it is not possible and that is why the arguments and the presentations of papers and all that all over every where it is going on happening but the problem that it is not completely developing our spiritual life and what can help us now sirama krishna mentioned over here and the last time he guided us the god can be seen in the living beings also because god is present over there and today he is mentioning one needs sadhana the sadhana means austerity spiritual practices mere study of scripture will not be he said mere study of scripture even some people they'll be studying the upanishads they'll be studying the veda then other other scriptures like the bhagavata and all that they'll be quoting from that they'll be explaining on that and they get very popular and nowadays so many young boys and girls also the they are coming forward to tell that that is good at least some people will know about it but those who are expounding explaining talking about that they have the unique capacity to mesmerize the people through their words through their lecture that is good but spiritually to develop the spirituality it needs sadhana and what is sadhana friends in the bhagavad-gita 17th chapter from 14 15 and 16 this mantras these verses is very clearly mentioned that there are three types of sadhanas means physically bodily and then barchika through words yes when we are practicing sadhana the words are also because we think that oh in the i am not wearing the any dress and in the severe cold i am just like this ordinary a simple dress i am sitting and that is a very great austerity sometimes people to practice austerity they don't wear the shoes they'll be working therefore many are there if you go to india you will find almost this type of austerities people are practicing so that is okay but what is true austerity bhagavan sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita very clearly mentioned it and if we follow that that will help us to develop the spirituality because our goal is to go beyond the circle of maya the bondage of maya this illusion because this world which we which we see is completely temporary at this moment we are not in a position to understand the true nature of this world but those who have realized the truth the god the brahman they very in clear terms they say this is just nothing like the creation of the magician the magician he makes the whole thing and thousands of people they're watching him and believing him as if that is the true but that is not true so this way and we have to practice sadhana to reach to that point and what is this first sadhana the 14th words 17th chapter bhagavad-gita it says brahmacharya this is body physically what one should do first it must be humble unless and until you are humble you are ready to learn there is no chance to develop spirituality if you say i know i know i know as because you have read this book that book and they'll be i've noticed that even the young novices they have come to realize god but they will be exchanging the books you know this book is wonderfully written these that different type of titles will be there they will read that they will quote from that but they are not practicing what actually the beneficial they are not at all courteous they are not at all humble and here it says the lord sri krishna mentioned deva first that is god the divine dwija holy people guru the teacher pragya and the wise and these four deva dweeja guru pragya pujanam not only that you are humble before them you have to worship them the word that he has used worshiping but so much of respect we are worshiping them deva these four type of people why because they have realized it and before realization they have gone through all these practices and they know what is what so if we go to them if we worship them we become humble and give them all the services then only they will talk the people who are going on giving lectures and publishing articles writing books very good people but they are for name and fame most of them majority of them and one who is going after the name and fame so obviously he has not realized the truth of this world the world is completely illusory and it will remain like this one after another the great personality is the they came but it will be like this because this is the maya this is the play of god i have to understand this and i have to go beyond the curtain of maya so how fast is humble humble before those who have already realized it and who are those god deva it's not the supreme god that means godly people and the god means unselfishness and love those who have realized that those who have uh are practicing that pure love no selfishness they are godly people dwight holy people guru the teachers the teachers are so compassionate and if we read the that our shankaracharya's books adi shankaracharya he is giving the description of a teacher how the teacher should be and pragya the wise person pujanam then shojam very clean the cleanliness in a the dirty way they leave somehow the old unwashed clothes they're wearing and this type of people won't be able to realize god you should be always fresh and free so one that otherwise it is impossible and then say arjubam upright very straightforward upright person not egoistic way of expression but whatever he is feeling he should express it in a proper manner and he knows how much is the ma i know and how much i can do the uprightness not to please someone telling the you know the hypocrisy they call i am not accepting you i don't like you also but apparently behaving like that and that is hypocrisy with the uprightness that truly he will say but in a very popular manner humble way so deva deejah guru prankiyah the god holy people teacher and the wise people should be worshipped that means one should be humble before them and at the same time always he or she those who are like to become spiritual very neat and clean and they should be upright then another two qualities brahmacharya so we have to have the continents the physically because that's a tremendous force tremendous force and no one goes and it is so impossible so we have to those who like to go to god they have to take mind should be completely controlled ahimsa brahmacharya and himself continence continues i am not giving my mind to the body the physical all this the joy no from there i am controlling the mind the saints organs and that is giving this tremendous strength in the body and mind so brahmacharya is a great word so much of discussions on these brahmacharya these continents that this is necessary and then come ahimsa non-violence how it is possible when i love others that is imsa i have hatred i don't like others but apparently i am eating only some vegetarian food no that is not aimsa himself physically how they told him sir i am not going to harm anyone not even in thought also neither physically not even in my thought and word that is kalahimsa that gives strength so this one two three four five six seven eight practices that gives the austerity the physical austerity austerity of the body austerity of the human body deva guru prague and it is said that these are the qualities and this is in the bhagavad-gita 17th chapter 14 verse another 15 words in the 15th mantra it says swaddhaya this is the scripture very clearly they are giving you the idea those who are truly and they like to develop the spirituality these are the and you have to be very patience you know going on practicing every moment i am failing to practice but still i have to do that by that way anud bega karambakim not using offensive words you know the one person he was not successful in many ways and wherever he was going he was failing failing feeling but in one time he became successful and then the success means a great success that was i was listening to someone he was talking about a great successful person in india and afterwards he became the president of india that is dr abdul kalam i don't know because sometimes some people they say like this whether in his life it is there or not i didn't check but i liked the idea when this that dr abdul kalam he went to appear in an interview and he failed and that was the last thing that he could do whatever the money that he was having and not only that he took the loan also to uh appear in the complete that education and appear in that exam but when he failed then he was thinking my god then what i will do if i go back to my village to my place then people will ask for the money back i won't be able to give and that what shall i do so he was thinking to commit suicide and that moment he met one person who could read his mind and said hey young man what you are trying to do what is there in your mind you're trying to kill yourself by killing you think that you'll be beyond all this no because your mind will go along with you and this thought will torment you everywhere be courageous this is one failure is nothing if you try you will be successful and i tell you the god has given already something for you and you will get it much much better than this and afterwards this gentleman became a very famous scientist and also the president of india and now when we talk about the president of india mostly this nam comes fast dr abdul kalam say he was from a very poor background very poor family but he was greatly successful so this is now suppose after this success when he goes back then someone will say oh so happy that you have been successful after say five or six or seven all failures before everyone he is introducing him so look at this man he was so everywhere he was failure and he was even going to commit suicide but anyway now he has become successful it was not necessary to introduce in that way but the other person was jealous and he will be introducing the this way this called udbega creating unnecessarily mental tension and sometimes some people the way they speak that creates the mental tension very unnecessarily so that is called anud that is the tapasya you know friends most of us we don't take care of all this and we expect that we will develop in the spiritual life and we think that as because we are associated with some of the spiritual groups and oh we are spiritual not at all the spirituality is completely different gives the full of love and the your views will be completely clear why because you will know the truth and what are the practices physically you have to practice this and then the speeches that also should be controlled because the speeches the words that can kill a person also and that can give a new life to another person so one should be very very careful we should not heart anyone through any words so it says [Music] vega means creating anxiety one should not say that one of the biggest it must be truthful truth that you are telling but at the same time priyam hitamcha when i am telling something to someone i am telling the truth but that truth i should put in such a way that that will be beneficial to him otherwise i should not say that rather i have to understand how to tell this to him so that he or she can get corrected but you think in that way bluntly if you say that person will be hard and they won't do anything so sattham that should be truthful at the same time priyam that should be very pleasant and hitamcha chummy's and hitham is beneficial so that means i have to control myself and when i am talking some person whom i really like to help but without hearting rather encouraging way so i have to develop some way to put that truth in that packaging of pleasant and benef beneficial so sattham priyam then next is swaddhaya what is that because mental mentally so our thoughts swat dwight what is that when we are in a dedicated way concentrated way with great love try trying to understand the spiritual truth and reading the scripture and the only those words that has come down to us of the realized souls the people those who were realized we call them rishi muni guru pragya they are words only not someone who just a writer good writer but no character doing these and that different way only for writing books only for some book grade books that sell books are sold and earned lot of money and going here there giving some lectures very good people let them enjoy the world but those who are truly realized to try to realize god for them only this only the those books which has been either told or written by the realized souls so that is called scripture and then scripture when we are starting we must be very carefully we should study and try to understand the meaning of it what it means sometimes some people will be going on remembering or memorizing all the slokas of the bhagavad-gita this is good so young people are encouraged to remember that that helps afterwards but it should help otherwise just like a parrot i am going on coating don't the machines the records nowadays memorizing the whole thing whatever you say that will be recorded over there it will remain over there anytime you just put it and immediately it will go on uh that quoting that or chanting those mantras it's only use them those words that has been written by the pragmas we must understand that what they mean that's why swat dwaya swadhyaya means studying the scripture regularly and with a concentrated mind and with a joyful happy mind and eager to understand the true meaning of it obvious practice obviously means practice that abhyasanam what practice we should do study you know if the mind is not pure if you don't like to realize god you will never like even to study the scripture one or two lines you are reading half a page oh my god the headache and so difficult to read don't understand anything because your mind is not pure when the gospel we are reading pages after pages some people they can't stop the book they will going on reading that book many words are their repetitions ramakrishna visiting different people and he is telling the same word repetitions are there but these people they will like it i have noticed over here the devotees were coming and almost everywhere so what the swamis are saying before us before them before that so all the same we are explaining the bhagavad-gita we are explaining the upanishads explaining the scriptures and in that way the some people they are very good in that particular language and they'll be putting words in a very nice way proper way and there some people have that capacity to put the word properly and they people like them this is one but the same thing this bhagavad gita was read by the bhagavad-gita swami vivekananda they also spoke about it and so many hundreds and thousands and millions of people at so many years thousands of years people are reading i'm also reading i'm quoting from the bhagavad-gita now that swat dwaya obyasanam regularly you have to practice it with all dedication oh these are the words that has inspired people like shankaracharya ramanujacharya and all these great personalities so this must be caring these are all holy words that must must help me so that way that is called swat daya when i am all with respect i am reading and i am getting interested in understanding it swat dwaya or piazza that should be practiced and that is called the austerity of the speech anud bega karambakyam not using offensive words rather using truthful pleasant beneficial words the two and three swaddhaya appyasanam the practice of the scripture reading scripture and understanding that these three that is called austerity of the speech then the 16th verse says the physical austerity austerity of the speech and austerity of the mind and this is more important manapra the serenity of the mind what is the fast austerity so many different type of thoughts waves after waves coming but i have to keep my mind in a tranquil sweden the one of our senior swamiji is to say this shall also pass they don't worry sometimes problems are coming sometimes appreciation successes are coming and if this goes on like this as if you are witnessing all this flow what is happening like that put like see it like that manapra sahada prasada means tranquility tranquility of the mind serenity of the mind mana prasada then sentines one must be very courteous gentle how it is possible the most of the in the modern society people are courteous gentle but that is apparent just oh hello how are you that much they will say but they don't feel or didn't see you for a long time they never wanted to see you but they say like that that is not the same samyatha means he is gentle because they don't like to hurt others in any way because he loves them she loves them a spiritual person must love feel loved and natural love for each and everyone whoever comes before they feel like loving why because the god manifested in that form sometimes some people they don't feel oh swamiji you are not taking care it is not possible for one person to take care of all but i pray for those people and all the monks they do like that because so many people are coming and the holy people that is there every day morning after praying to the god and first thing that the blessings we beg from god for each and every one servant garni so this is the way let everyone be free from the anxiety and suffering that is the prayer every day so mana prasada the mind is tranquil because i know that this all trouble or problem or appreciation whatever is happening is all temporary so i am not affected by that so my mind is tranquil and because the mind is tranquil because i don't have any desire i don't have any selfishness i'm so mia the samya samya tara in the chandi also about the goddess the power that the power of god it mentioned that is also samya samya means all is full of love that's called somyatam munam it is silent what is it just not talking at all is a silence a silence means satisfied he has already realized the truth that is why the silence self-controlled and self-control why because understanding the truth of the world he is always controlled and when the mind is controlled when the other finer at the sense organs are controlled like the mana buddhi chita ahamkar then the eyes then the nose and the touch and taste and all those they're controlled that man becomes mana prasada and not only that bhabha samsuddi is a great word bhavasam sudhi means he's always truthful no hypocrisy in the aim a religious person means no hypocrisy that practice is called sadhana no hypocrisy whatever i am that is i am and i tell people in this way mix people in this way it's open book they're not hiding anything when we meet the people then there'll be some way they'll meet and they will talk and as if they were all the time in connection with the god and then only for a few moments they can come down oh that may be i'm happy those people are doing like that but the bhabha-sam suddhi means as bhagavan si ramakrishna said moon in bengali he said the mind whatever the thought is there that you are speaking that means you are a genuine person there is no hypocrisy at all that is bhabha samsuddi that all these are these are the mental tapa or the austerity the bhagavad-gira krishna said that you have to practice sadhana and there is a beautiful song it says that sadhana in the hindi they say oh my mind you must practice austerity so what are the prosthetics the three types first is physical then baci and their speeches and monastic thought and then sudama krishna is continuing he is mentioning here like this the mahima we have so many duties in the world where is the time for sadhana this is mahima charan the he is arguing with the bhagavatama krishna he is mentioning we have so many duties now this mahi macharan he always go for the i am a then gyani i follow the path of knowledge but when came the sadhana that you have to practice this thing immediately he said oh so many things where is the time when we'll do it because we are in the household and we have so many other responsibilities if you have those responsibility how can you say that i am brahmana and how can you say that i am practicing the power in the path of knowledge in the path of knowledge you have to give up everything you cannot accept anything so this is hypocrisy you are doing something and saying something practicing something and propagating something else without hurting him he said why should you say such a thing when the muhimah said we have so many duties in the world where is the time for sadhana the sirama krishna why should you say such a thing it is you who describe the world as illusory like a dream mahima as because he read some scripture he'll be boasting all the time whenever there will be a gathering you will say like that why we are constantly mentioning this because this type of personalities we meet every time everywhere in all situa situation you will find they always boast but they are not genuine the surama krishna is mentioning the rama and lakshmana wanted to go to siloam that's just like another the story type he said but the ocean was before them lakshmana was angry taking his bow and arrow he said i shall kill baruna but the god the who is responsible for water this ocean prevents our going to siloam rama explained the matter to him saying lakshmana all that you are all that you are seeing is unreal like a dream the ocean is unreal your anger is also unreal it is equally unreal to think of destroying one unreal thing by means of another unreal thing so this is the path of knowledge that there should not be any reaction when it is happening in this world because you know everything is unreal the rama is very clear about it doing the muhima all the time quoting before the others and giving an expression that he is a man of knowledge the sirama krishna is telling him see this should be the way you should understand mahima charan kept quiet those who are following these classes you know the mahima characters he kept quiet he had many duties in the world and he had lately started a school to help the others mastered to mahima sambhu one said to me somebo he was a very rich man in in those society he said to me i have some money it is my desire to spend it for good works for school dispensaries roads and so forth i said to him it will be good if you can do these works in a selfless spirit but it is extremely difficult to perform unselfish action now doing something good is good but when you are you can or one can do it without any motive or i am doing it and then it will be named after my father or my mother or in our family and people should know that we have done it and or sometimes the political people will do that and in exchange they will ask those people to support him in the election no that is not so you can do that all rich people sometimes they do it that's good but spiritually now friends again and again we have to harp on this particular word are you truly interested to develop your spirituality then listen to bhagavan sirama krishna and what he said this very good work but can you do it in an unselfish way selfless way then it is all right a devotee said what is the way for worldly people with this type of questions sarama krishna answered in many different way but this and every time what he mentioned is this sadhu sangha here also he says the siddha master the company of holy main worldly people should listen to the spiritual talk they are in the state of madness intoxicated with lust and gold so it is necessary to listen to the holy people and who are the holy people friends the i was thinking to share with you this again in one of our scripture in the bhagavata it gives the idea what is the holy people holiness and it says in this way the moment we say a holy person it doesn't mean address or some of the gesture question no holy person means again the qualities god realization spirituality and everything we know that you have to develop these qualities then only your mind reaches to that level from where you can see equally some other situa in sanskrit again and what is the goal of spiritual life to reach to that same sightedness there should not be any difference either you see god in everything and everything in god or you see the consciousness is in everything and nothing else and when we realize that there is no differences so that is called samadhar situa the same sightedness and that is exactly what is the goal of spiritual life we call it brahma-yana we call it god realization but at least outside externally when you see that some people are behaving like this then we can understand they have reached to that highest point the first is the quality of a holy person must be kripalu is a very kind-hearted person must be sometimes cruel people apparently they are talking very sweet way sugar-coated words but one must be very clear on one should be very intelligent to understand the truth of it so that person who is truly having a compassionate heart that is fast quality those who are trying to become monks who we must read it down the first quality is kind-hearted a never harm anyone that is the quality of a monk never heart anyone akrita dhruva titikshu sarvathi hinam it is forbearing and he never do any harm to anyone sarva-dehina antitikshu anyone insulting him criticizing praising and whatever quietly you should accept it then satyas are always truthful anabad without jealousy these are the excellent qualities then one per person can be known as a holy person no jealousy sama doing good to all well this belongs to my religion my language my country my society so i will try to do them and for others i will never no he is not a monk he is not a sadhu he is not a holy person he may be a good person and maybe a good patriarch may be in a social the lover and social worker all these things but not a holy person free from last kamui and then self-controlled mridu very gentle shuchi love cleanliness it's called shuchi akincanaha never accept excess anything whatever necessary that much he takes not that he is not taking anything there is also another extreme and understanding misunderstanding of it whatever when as long as the human body is there we need the clothings we need food we need many things but that person will take that much which is sufficient for him not more than that aniha never worked for selfishness or knee huh with a selfish motive it will never work meet a booker with control the eating also shanta peaceful steeda and that never transgrease the state sata means he knows his swadharma swadharma again a sanskrit word then there are in particularly in the ancient indian society they divided the society into four categories first is brahmacharya goddess the sannyas that the student life then the life of a householder then life of retired people then the life of recluses so this each and every time they have their own duties and responsibilities that is called swa dharma and then different type of responsibilities in the society human society that is also swadharma that this person who is a holy person he never transgress never made any mistake to practice his own duty matsalana i always remember me only person is supposed to go on remembering god muni always discriminative now why these why that why it is happening whatever i am doing is it good for all so then only i will do so that manancil apramatya never break the vows as a monk we have taken some vows and those vows is that i'm not going to harm anyone i am not going to do anything for my name and fame these are the vows you'll never break that is called oprah gambiratma eva thoughtful sometimes some people they are good people suddenly they are behaving very peculiarly and this monk or the holy person and always they consider oh why he's behaving like this today this must be something there it's not reacting immediately so gambira atma so whatever is happening all around different type of things sometimes good sometimes bad he is not affected because he can control his mind and can analyze and can try to understand the truth so gambira atma eva thoughtful dritiman he is very patient they conquer six conditions and these conditions are the shudha trishna shoka going beyond the fear of all this that's called shorthaguna omani is very humble and never care for who is giving in respect or not it doesn't bother but monada he gives respect to others there's some good people or successful people and some people who are having some qualities and they he will give the mana the respect to them kalpa having qualities explain the spirituality this is a wonderful term they have used kalpa a holy person is supposed to explain the spirituality clearly how it is possible because he or she the holy person will know it thoroughly that is why it becomes easy for that person to explain now again i will refer bhagavan sirama krishna when he is explaining it is so simple sir can god be with former without form he said both when you are with a great devotion praying to god and praying him to ex come before you in that particular form of your choice god comes in that way he's all powerful for any type of the form he can take and suppose you think no god is all pervading his consciousness he cannot have any form he's not formed then he gives the example that solves the problem the debate that continued for thousands of years salama krishna explained it to the ordinary people in such a nice way have you not seen the water when the cool breeze are there that same water becomes isis that means with form the water which is usually without form become isis that means with form now when there is a sunlight that same eyes that means the form melts away and become water so when people are trying to reach god or the truth in the path of knowledge discrimination inquiry there is no form and the same thing when they are going with emotion dedication devotion is form see this is called kalpa it's a nice way simple way that is the who is can be the holy person all these qualities the matra it means not only friendliness mitra means friend maitra means he never cheat anyone no cheating at all and karunika is very friendly and kobe he is a realized soul he can see for he's a realized soul so friends these are the qualities and that is says a holy person bhagavan sirama krishna said if you go to a holy person the company of a holy person then you can realize god that is he was he wanted to know how to realize god said what is the way for worldly people he said company of holy people holy men worldly people should listen to spiritual talk they are in a state of madness intoxicated with the lost and gold a drunkard should be given rice water as an antidote drinking it slowly he gradually recovers his normal consciousness a worldly person should also receive instructions from a sad guru a real teacher such a teacher has certain signs these are the qualities he said one should not receive instruction from a pandit who has not realized the world to be unreal only if a pandit has discrimination and renunciation he is entitled to instruct so thank you friends i think we should stop over here so when a a person is going to take the spiritual instruction the sometimes they make mistake because they think that the nowadays you know that the people they are going reaching to every room every houses and because other tv and so many uh the developed technology so by that way people are reaching out and many of them in many different way they are trying to but one should be very careful but the modern day people they are also intelligent so one should be very very careful even in the mahabharata at the time of sri krishna in the mahabharata we find dharma biyapari is a word that has been used dharma biapari the people who uses the religion for their own benefit it's a business this day for purpose as if you are giving religion and earning money name fame position so one should be careful so we should pray to the supreme lord to give us a proper guide thank you if you have any question the first question is from kamal babu he's asking it is somewhat it is somewhat easy to practice same sightedness in the waking state but is it also possible to do the same in dreaming and sleep states i find it very difficult can you please provide some guidance the babu the you say that it is easy somewhat easy to practice same-sided nuts it's really difficult you know i will i should appreciate if you can do it it's a great thing samadhar shithua is the highest the condition the most of us majority of the people our mind always me and mine is there ahamkara is there ankara means the small group me and mind thee and thine like that so even then if you try to practice that all are equal and that will affect in your dream also must be when the waking state you can do that your mind is full with that love and
