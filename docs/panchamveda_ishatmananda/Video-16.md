[17.Panchama Veda 17: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvcQIQtFj38)

hey the previous day when we were discussing uh to some extent we were discussing about that there's a great world then vishwas then bhakti then the fast and foremost i should have a faith visa otherwise i cannot proceed that's why ramakrishna said that vishas that means in spiritual path if you have the faith that god exists god is there and whatever my guru has said whatever the scripture the sastra has said is true and i will follow i will surely realize god this conviction is vishwas and this is called sat down what on the words of guru total faith complete faith and with respect on the words of the guru and also on the words of the scripture buddhism whatever they said is true and how that think thought will come that their whatever they are telling is true because faith on him when bhagavan krishna is telling something that must be true because he has realized and he has come to help us in this life that type of faith should be there otherwise we cannot make progress majority of the people they will go from here to the this place to that place and they are constantly digging a little over here and little over there and cannot make the will and cannot get the water to drink all through their life they remain thirsty so this is the reason you go and taste and check and not solve all right but have faith somewhere and who are to realize the truth to realize so that is the goal of human life and suppose we don't go for that what will happen will constantly go on routing rounding in the cycle of birth and death death and birth it will go on if you like you can continue but suppose you don't like if you realize the pain the pants then you have to believe in god you have to believe have faith in the words there are three types then he is telling about the indeed is there but the saatvi sadha that is the best this respect this faith this belief that is a that taking us to liberation so the dogmas and the doctrines and the ceremonies the rituals are only to help us to give this faith otherwise it is very difficult to get the faith and sometimes we get so many things i read and one someone saying as saying it's very wonderfully he has mentioned then one supervisor an engineer a constant construction was going on with a building construction and the supervisor was on the sixth floor from there he saw one person is working on the ground floor he wanted to draw his attention he wanted to talk to him but in the construction site so many songs are there the man is also working so he couldn't so he was shouting couldn't get his attention so he threw one fight would be not before him and the person who saw the right rupee note just in front of him came from the above he took the note immediately kept in the pocket but never looked up where from it came who gave it it didn't show any curiosity simply kept it in his pocket and working then the person how to do draw his attention second time he took out another 500 rupees note that was the only note that he was having with me so he threw it again to him to draw the attention it was very important to talk to him this fellow again the moment it was there for his body he picked it up kept in the body never looked up then finally the supervisor the engineer he picked up a stone and threw it on his head and when the stone came and hit the man then he looked up where from it came who threw it so the way by is trying to say that when the god is giving us the gift happiness we never remember him we never look at him the where from the success came where wherefrom all these things came happiness came from god i should be respectful to god at least give a thanks to him no but when the sorrow is coming heat is coming and then only we are understanding and pray to god why you are so angry with me why giving me the punishment and these things will be looking at god then only so this is better to have the faith on the words of god unlike the personalities like sri chaitanya guru nanak sri ramakrishna sri ram sri krishna and then we can proceed towards godhead that is called atma gyana now here the sudama krishna is talking about that you must have heard about the tremendous power of faith it is said that in the purana rama who was god himself the embodiment of the absolute brahmana had to build a bridge to cross the sea of sea to siloam but hanuman his devotee trusting in rama's name cleared the sea in one jump and reached the other side he had no need to of a bridge so everybody is laughing so this is only the way he is telling and then afterwards we find that ceramic is telling a wonderful story there was a bhagavad-gita in our country bhagavad-gita they will be going to the houses and they will read the bhagavata and then they'll expound explain bhagavat in the beginning it is all about the sri krishna and his leader all his divine sports but actually the bhagavata ultimately resolved this pundit he was going uh to a king's house and he was reading out the bhagavata and after reading he is to explaining is to ask the king king have you understood very peculiar used to say bundy you first understand and pundit used to king is telling so it is difficult but he used to feel encircled what is it i know i am reading and why is that asking me to understand this again and again every day it is going on so one day he really sad to think why the king is still like this every time i say it is naturally the teacher and the student after teaching this teacher asked have you understood is it clear to you the student will say yes sir no sir but it's just opposite student is telling the teacher you properly understand first then so that's why he was confused today he said he was thinking why this then ultimately what happened it dawned him why what i am teaching i am going to teach bhagavata to the king to get some money from him some favor from him and subject that i am teaching only telling again and again renounce renounce renounce and that is the that is why the king always remind me telling you understand fast he stopped going over there the king understood the pundit that understand it understood it properly so this is the way we have to though we are reading expounding explaining asking people to do follow but majority of the time we are not clear we don't have faith there was another party there are so many stories in our country it is told by sirama that pundit he had a habit to drink hot milk first and then in the morning he will sit and read padavada and the lady she used to bring the milk from the other bank of the river to sell the meal to the pundit but since she had to cross the river she had to wait for the boats sometimes the old man is late there's no goat all this problem was there and always the conditions to review god why you are not in time without the milk i cannot go and see it i cannot get the energy etc every day he used to tell him dear her like that and one day she got so late and then pandit was already there explaining the bhagavad gita sitting before him this lady very secretly she was entering the back side and then she heard the bandit is explaining to the devotee with the faith in god you can cross the ocean of our samsara this world is life you can cross just with the faith of god this lady without knowing the real meaning of it she had the great faith on pandit he's a great person she thought if a person can cross the ocean just by taking the name of god on faith of god can't i cross the river next day i will try next day morning early morning series then the party told how come today he was so early she told i just walked over the river i never waited for the boatman to help me you walked over the river what do you say yes yesterday only you were explaining that one can cross the ocean of samsara this whole world this life only by having the faith on god then i thought why not crossing the river so i crossed bandit was not believing he said but he never had the faith can you show me why not come at me she went over there oh god i like to cross the river please help me and she walked over there water and then she called pandey you also come here she is walking really just walking on the water and it also took the name of god oh god i like to cross myself but at the same time he was drawing his clock so that he it don't get wet see he was not having the full hundred percent faith the moment he was on the water he was in the water because the bundy though he was explaining not having the complete faith but this lady though illiterate complete faith so tremendous power tremendous power so this is how the ramakrishna he explaining and then if a man has faith in god then even if he has committed the most sins such etc he will be he will certainly be saved through his faith the faith has so much power if he has committed some mistakes some scenes since means some of the work that is harmful to others so even then if he is going to the god and praying to the god complete faith i made a mistake god is going to see then he is singing so this is the uniqueness of the hinduism they are arguing with the god challenging the god because if i take the your name at the last moment of my life and then pass out then i died he was supposed to come and save me you must then he is telling at the moment of my death i will say durgady and you are bound to save me so this is the faith so here siram krishna he himself singing if only i can pass away repeating durga's name how can't doubt them oh blessed one withhold deliverance from me richard though i am and then ultimately he is telling what is his teaching that you must have the faith on god and that is a wonderful way i will do all these things but you have to save me because i have taken your name and your name can save everything there's a wonderful sloka in krishna yadav the ladies of the gopis of bindavan they were holding the hand of krishna krishna forcefully took away the hand and he was going away then they are telling you may do that because you have the strength in your body we couldn't hold you so you are taking away your hand from us but that is nothing can you go away from our heart you cannot if you can then i will consider we will consider you are really a strong person you can't do that so this is again his telling then i will consider that you are really a strong person see the faith in god your power is within me because i love you you are within my heart you have no power to go away so this is the faith of the devotees on god but this faith is always positive never negative so that we have to be very very careful to understand sometimes people will be telling if we are doing this he will go to heaven so go and kill these people and you will go to heaven it can never be so this we have to understand this is the way that devotees surround krishna again and again stealing you may be a devotee why should be should you you be a fool the devotee should not behave like a fool you must think you must judge then you accept and do that what for the brain is there even if the vedas say the milk is black should you have to believe it no so this is the beauty of this they never say that you must have to have faith they say yes believe have faith that god is there some people are telling unless we see the god how can we believe that god is there the answer of salaam krishna is unique he is telling in the daytime you cannot see the stars does it mean there is no no star in the sky sometime we cannot see because of so many other things are there because of our maya because of our attachment we are covered with so many things as they call in totally maya or your like that so we can't realize god the moment those things will be removed you can see god face to face so for that we have to have the faith in the classrooms also the teacher will be telling suppose this plus this is this and this is and from there because suppose only the whole thing begins having the faith on that suppose he is becoming a scientist a mathematician so if he says why should i suppose you want to be able to learn mathematics there you have to have that then only you come to conclusion you get everything so here also pointing to narendra another thing is happening he is introducing narendra young man of 18 19 years old a teenager he is introducing in those diseases in the beginning also with his devotees pointing the narendra master say you all see this boy he behaves that way here but he's quite another person who he plays in the chandni chandi means the place where our people used to meet before the surama krishna before the senior people he is quite a sitting but if you like to see his personality his own behavior then you have to see separately in a chatni if you go a naughty boy seems very gentle when with his father he's mentioning narendra and people of his type belong to the class of ever free though he is mentioning naughty that means he has the tremendous power within him see the majority of the people this narendrana in the classroom in other places used to be in behave in such a way the people is to think that he's a naughty person not that he was so intelligent it was so easy for him to understand the whole class that the teacher started teaching something explaining something immediately he understood what he's going to tell so it is over so his attention is going somewhere else so teacher used to think that he is naughty he was not intelligent so this way rama krishna was an excellent teacher immediately understood what power is there in the boy and he's telling a naughty boy seems very gentle when it is bothered narendra and people of his type belong to the class of ever free they are not bombed slowly he is introducing narendra with other devotees so why narendrana some people will be telling this year is also 2013 is the year of 150th birth anniversary of many other swamis they are also the direct disciples of krishna and the personality like our raja maharaja brahmanandaji then why we are not celebrating him because narendra was very special vivekananda was special krishna introducing he is telling when they grow a little older they feel the awakening of inner consciousness and go directly toward god they come to the world only to teach others so there is a saying i mean story i think in rajya maharaj's book of parade he was dreaming one day and he dreamt that he left the body and going to the heaven and when he is going to the heaven he saw the hall of brahmananda and mahapurush maharaja they are all sitting over there and he is going he looked at them and said hello and then going away then rajaman has told where you are going i am going to narendra to swamiji then the smile and said come and sit with us you can never reach to narendra he came to us but we cannot go to him so that is the heart of swami vivekananda sometimes the reflection of the moon will be on the water and the fish they think all the fishes they will come and play with the moon the reflection of the moon thinking the moon is our frame what is so near to us when the night passes there is no moon no reflection of the moon then if they jump even they cannot reach the moon so high so when narendra came here we thought many people thought he is just like one of us some people is criticizing why not like him so many other monks are also there we without understanding the truth of it they do not understand the anything about the religious side so that's why just they are comparing with others and thinking krishna is introducing if we this is just beginning in the in his gospel he is introducing with his devotees the vedas speak of the huma then he is speaking about the homage and narendra was sitting over there he was listening but he was not at all happy the ceramic krishna was praising him because he was not eye consciousness even a little ego if somebody someone is praising the naturally we are all happy it is just opposite with silver sirama krishna is praising he never liked it but he couldn't say sir please don't talk like that so he got up and went out of the room at this point narendra left the room kedar prana krishna in and many others remain did the name devotees name those who are reading the gospel and the biography of krishna again and again we come across these people you see narendra excels in singing playing on his instrument study in everything the other day he had a discussion with kedar and tore his arguments and suramar krishna was so happy this intelligence may be so many intelligent people will be there and they may be having so many other qualities the one brahmacharyan we have seen they know seven eight languages they can read they can write they can talk wonderful capacity and there are so many who can compose songs and then we can deep the tune and can see wonderful capacities there are some people who in this speak mesmerize the whole crowd wonderful capacities but still not like narendra modi why because narendra was not having any ego and the people who are not having the ego then what they're having godhead god within their heart and they are nothing but god just in the human form so we have to understand this personality otherwise we won't be able to then he is telling to aim is there any book in english on reasoning krishna he never attended school but here they he knew the alphabets and he could write also a wonderful handwriting very good and writing nowadays people they always use the computer the handwriting is very bad when they write after that they can't read what would they available so this is the condition because they always use the computer there's one person he was the only literate person in the village so people used to come and take his help to write the later in 50 years before that was the condition of indian villages so one gentleman came to the person and said can you please write a letter for my daughter she leaves such and such village i like to post it then he said no i cannot why i am having pain in my leg but you are writing with your hand you are having the pain what is there if you are having the pain in your leg what is there you are going to write through the hand but you won't understand after writing when you are posting the letter i have to go to our house and read it out because my handwriting nobody can read it so that is the level of education so this way the here sirama krishna is telling is there any book of argument that's because narendra modi was arguing in such a way so he was curious he wanted to know everything that in the world he wanted to know master was little embarrassed he said one part of the book deals with the deduction from the journal to the particular he was talking about the book yes it's called logic then he was talking about that siram krishna very hard these words he was explaining from these to that from general to particular particular to the journal all this that logic book is explaining he was trying to explain but the moment he heard he understood and he was okay when the meeting broke up the devotees they went to the temple garden it was five o'clock in the afternoon after a while master also went to the panchayati and he returned back this is very important after a while he returned to the master's room there on the small north baranga he witnessed an amazing sight those who have visited the destination particularly the room they can visualize that the north side the small barangay was there after that is a flower garden then the ganga is a wonderful place and sirama krishna was there was standing still surrounded by a few devotees narendra was singing now the srima master is commenting had never heard anyone except the master sing so sweetly the the voice of pastrami vivekananda was so sweet this is the voice of the yogis are very sweet the singers they can sing they know the grammar of the song and they'll be doing so many but the sweetness of the voice has come from the yoga so master marshall srima he heard sirama krishna singing and afterwards when he first time hearing narindana commenting like this and he looked at sirama krishna he was struck with wonder for the master stood motionless with eyes transfixed he seemed not to bring a devotee told in that master was in samadhi so this is the first time the master is having the experience he has read about samadhi he knew the word samadhi he had a little idea about what samadhi but this is the first time he is seeing someone in samadhi and here we see as we are reading the uh this our meditation class then we will come across to this test by the restraint of even these is indicating another type of samadhi there are two different types of samadhi we cannot concentrate our mind how what to think of samadhi but those who are reaching that level they are thinking they have two different type of samadhis one is total concentration is samathi concentration on a particular object this is is full of knowledge but even the mind is taking help of something to concentrate look at it mind is taking something to concentrate on it may be a knowledge and sometimes some ladies suddenly they were in the politics suddenly they put on a giveaway and took the name but without understanding the meaning of the name anyway it sounds good so it is okay so this is what returned by pranka means full knowledge but the concentration is on the knowledge it's called sambra samadhi but here that's a being even then that that's the idea of the knowledge that also the vanishes just try to imagine intellectually what is the condition of the mind nero they even that is also not there there sargon everything has been cleared nothing is there this called samadhi these inca this is called near there is no seed at all it means something on which the mind is why because just for that mind once again come down krishna muhammad in every moment he used to go to that certain people to something so that's why when he went to a village and because the kritan was going on the people hundreds of people they were singing the lord's name dancing in ecstasy though in devotion he was so happy because people are calling god calling on god naturally his mind was every time going to that level and be forcefully bringing it down and seeing that condition all the villagers started telling come there is a very unique person has come he dies this moment alive this moment because the moment he is in samadhi there is no breathing no movement even the eyes are also fixed when doctor and he was not an ordinary person he was a scientist also in those days he was a founder member of that research center in calcutta and he was not believing at all and he used to love syrah location he used to treat him one day when he was in shamadi he put his finger on siram krsna's eyeball think of it if anybody is coming bringing the finger or anything near the eye immediately we blink our eye lead will come down and open like that it is just natural and when he was touching the eyeball there there is no breathing there is no life in the body at all complete dead man again coming into life so it was so peculiar so all people in the whole village in hundreds they were coming to see a person who is dying this moment and getting life in this moment this is called awesome and if we think that just by some ten dollars sitting in a couch and closing the eyes we are going to have the nirvikalpa god bless you now this is so difficult to understand so difficult and this saw him in this condition and he was astounded i have read but this is the first time i see many of the pundits scholars in those days used to come and meet cerama krishna and they used to tell sriram krishna is very humble see all great bandits are coming all the highly educated people are coming they have read so many books shastras they can chant moment they want i can't do anything so he is he'll be behaving very humbly but these people some of them who had little tapasya the question means eradicating the ego these to understand some of them they commented we have only raped but you are leaving the whole truth you are leaving there is no thought at all thought waves when the mind is totally free from any thought waves that mind is called as a dead mind and that is the highest the fruit of highest austerity shastra siddhanta monks that is the highest goal moksha that is called the total when a devotee he don't want moksha then what he will get he will reach to god and he will see god and he or she saying there is no difference that is the ultimate of a devotional path they are going to there sarupya all these things they will enjoy and for these gyanis and the yogis moksha and this moksha or the liberation there what is liberation when in the mind there is not a single thought and the moment there is a small single thought immediately mind start waving so you are not in samadhi in that condition if anyone with great austerity reaches sirama krishna is telling within 71 days his body died he died why because there is no consciousness in the body he never takes care of the body so drinking eating taking care of the body is totally absent that is the ultimate that is the decision of the scriptures they say and here sirama krishna in samadhi and narendra's singing meditate o my mind on the lord hari chinmaya their devotee devotion but talking about impersonal god as a hari hadi is a personal god but at the same time what is that how he's and he is the totality of all knowledge he is the source of all knowledge cheetah ghana having no strain or why because he is not having any selfishness so that is the brahman the quran again says simple way they are telling if one can sing with devotion and faith the holy name of hari the god then khari means the god then he will be free from his sins will be free from all troubles all troubles and also the free from all unhappiness but so many people will be singing if you go to asham and all those places the mainly bengalis are from east bengal they're highly devoted people and devoted people and they think that if you go on singing the name of god for 24 hours or 72 hours all your sin eradicated so whole year they will do whatever then only for two days or three days they will hire some people to sing the name of god they themselves they will be taking care of the guests and the people who are coming looking after socializing all they will do but they will organizing and hire people and one group cannot sing for 24 hours so there will be three four groups and there will be again some competition which group is giving singing in oregon but in different tune and when i was there i used to hear sometimes they will be using the cinema songs also i didn't you can hear it is very melodious but this is using the cinemas tuning so that way they are singing i told but you don't see yourself if you have to get the blessings of god and if you like to be free from all the sin you have to go and pray you need not to sing then they say we are not singers we can't sing we need not to you go and bang your head and cry and only say hurry hurry show your devotion to god then only he will understand and all the blessings that god eve gave i don't know it will go to the singers only but even the singers may not get because they are not singing inside the room they are utilizing the microphone it's not like america anything and everything they will use microphones and that microphone will go after the one kilometer so all people who they like or not they have to listen to that very name and everybody's so angry when hundreds are angry how can you get the blessings of god think of it so this is the faith no this is not the faith you have to understand what is faith faith the belief in the name of god that is good but not by disturbing others so this is all things it is eradicated through the devotion but what you have to do within your heart continuously you are going on singing within your heart when you are working inside the room sweeping the floor cooking doing something go on singing music and constantly thinking of the god it's a wonderful thing and so many wonderful songs are also there as if the mother she is chasing the lord rama the small little wrong as a young boy she he is going over here and they are doing something with steve the mom mother she is chasing the boy that way the songs are there so this is the emotion if we utilize we realize god because the constant remembrance of god is coming through the songs we sing songs sometimes people will be telling swamiji is singing a song after one hour lecture and telling all this truth then they will ask swamiji is sing a song but for whom just you will like it but whether the god will like it or not when i am singing if i am concerned about what the people sitting over here and how they are reacting whether they are liking it or not and after one or two lines looking at the double chin the person who isn't playing on tabla and giving the instruction you change your bait and looking someone very responsible famous person is coming then putting hands like this is this the pajama when he was a young boy he used to go and used to see that devotional songs are going on but these people are so much eager to welcome the rich people the jamindas the landlords and then again they will be singing in a visway that is god is not pleased even a person like narendra the modi he used to seeing siram krsna's mind used to soar high and used to go in samadhi but that day narendra modi curry without salt you have prepared something without salt it is not tasty at all your song was like that why because today you have not put your devotion and concentration on the mind that is true brahmami bhartapuram when it is telling that if you sing the lord's name all sin will be eradicated as true but at the same time it is not just singing and looking here and there they don't do so foreign he gets liberation there is no doubt those people they constantly they will be vishnu and it is true that when you are hearing it maybe it surely be done done like that it never follows any he is committing but he has a great devotion and he will be singing the name of lord with devotion and surely he will get the blessings of god no doubt in it so one long back we were in advaithasrama and and is a publication center from there used to go to different type of national book fair international book fair or the promotion of the books and once we went to delhi that was the prime minister and india mother was the initiative disciple of ramakrishna mission she was the disciple of our mahapurus and as kamala nahinu the wife of this mr maher she used to bring young indirently to ramakrishna mission so naturally she had a great affection a relationship and that time she came to inaugurate that function and from distance you saw krishna's picture so though it was not in the schedule of the prime minister to visit because the ramakrishna vivekananda's picture was there she straightway came and she stood in our shop he offered to tattoo we gave her a gift of the book she also purchased one or two small books inquired about is it all right she was very popular at that time and ordinary people came to know that indragon they visited our shop you know the craziness all people came in that book they wanted to purchase anyway we could sell our book and then i was adding that that was going on then just opposite to our that counter there's a small say 20 by 10 square feet just opposite work another religious groups are there and all that area was only religious spiritual groups arabinda and so many others these people got jealous because all people are coming to us and they started at the microphone they somewhere they brought and the huge that loudspeaker and started very krishna like that in such a high although it was impossible to talk you can understand when you are hearing such a sound is you can't talk you can hear and it was from the morning to evening the whole hour constantly secondly it was unbearable so i went and told them you want you can't stop it because you are not supposed to play music over here how people can concentrate on the books they have come to purchase them now you are a sinner how come how do you know it i was not doing it that i am a senior then he said that you cannot uh listen to the arena that is because i am on the other side of the amplifier and you are at the back side you also come to the front listen to it for the hours you will also become a cinema this is very peculiar that they think that they are doing very good work spreading the name of but it is a torture anyway i went to the office here's a punjabi in the punjabi and he was there he came visit swamiji okay he came and he told please don't do it again when he left these people were that time again they put on it was going i went to the south africa officer i told see they are not listening again they are playing that song the swamiji may crack a room with you why you are an officer you can go and seize those then at least give me the permission that i can go and stop it then i told and told them then this ramakrishna is telling you have to be according if you are according to the people so i went and told either you stop it or i will break it that is fine then they understood somehow stopped it so this is way uh renama it removes but to whom we have to foreign used to love songs again and again when you are going through the pages of the gospel we will find how he is singing the bhajan and also listening that that is a great thing today i think time is up if you have any questions please ask in the gospel you have any question anyone just get up don't feel shy and sometimes how other will think i if you ask the question then you may be the others may be benefited by getting the answer and the question also question is doubt maybe to clarify sometimes i'm also not knowing the whole thing i try to explain as far as i know from the business is not like in our country these two when we are young students they used to say hey are you in the humanities group oh yeah no even if this group is nothing science group so it is not science or humanities are like that it is only you have to reach god and that applies to your own psychology if you think that by devotion you feel better then that is your path if you think that dhyana is the way you feel better then that is your path so it is all parts are the same it's a good question and hurry down different languages how how it is uniqueness because different religion has the different languages and their very names so they have researched the mind of human being and they have found that there are four different types though we looks all same but our temperament is four different types one is all the time discriminating not criticizing some people will be there constantly criticizing this is not good this is not bad then what you want that also i don't know like that so this is not the people this kyana yogis did discriminate like the scientist why this says so they are a different class they will be thinking like this another is major portion of their mind is emotional the moment they think about some stories of shri krishna or these there will be tears to roll then that is a devotional time another people are there who like to help others work others very active but not that way concentrating another is very calm quiet don't like to talk they like to meditate in the corner of the room always the people they say unsocial people like them but at that time so in our sastra in our scripture in our sanatana dharma they have given these four paths you can do that even the person who is working he is also thinking of god through music so in our and there are so many others in other religion also there are songs are there but some religion they think this is the softness so one should not believe in song so they have banned the songs you cannot do this only four or five times you have to do like this there is one two three four and they believe that by simply practicing that one will get the blessings of god they are not believing in them some others like the christianity also then they will be singing the carol songs praising the god describing the god the the describing the birth of god so that can also also the emotion that will come to them that's also good silent night holy night they're describing in that situation slowly the god is coming in that place etc etc so those who are christians if they're closing their eyes and thinking that song also beneficial to them but it is not the music but the words and the meaning of the words if it is working playing within the mind that gives the benefit so many virgins you'll see the cassettes all they are sitting like a very religious person the picture is on the top and they will be singing bhajan people are very happy clapping but they are only entertainers not devotion so this way in each religion on in each faith this bhajans this emotion helps thank you so let us conclude with this loka niranjana foreign is me foreign
