[286: Panchama Veda 286 : Householders Debts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_YIXIYLl8Q)

namaskar dear devotees and friends today wednesday evening we'll be reading and discussing from the gospel of bhagavan si ramakrishna so as usual we'll begin with the mantra today at the page number 701 the master's birthday that devotees have gathered they are celebrating and whatever the food they offered ramakrishna in his intoxicate in that the condition uh the you know the supreme condition he couldn't taste that food but they prepared so he was eating now he's talking with the devotees and he said a very important thing for householder devotees the householders has various debts debts to the god to the fathers to the rishis he also owes a debt to his wife he should like that he said he should uh support her if she is a chest o man now friends in our sanatana dharma we saw that the whole human life they have made in a four different sections and again according to the capacity they have given the four asramas it's called chatur asrama chatur means four the four burners and four astronauts what are the burners burners their capacity to work to understand accordingly the burner the brahmana shatriya baisha those who are very intelligent very calm they're that those people they are brahmanas in bhagavad-gita they have given a list bhagavan sri krishna has given a list so these are the responsibilities the works that the brahmana should perform should do and also the shatria and basha and sudras so these four those who are sudras they are physically they will help others the bushes economically help the society and the satrias they will protect the society and rule the country and the brahmanas that is the hate that's why very wonderfully and a lot of importance has been given in the sanatana dharma on these four the divisions the four barna the burnham is color as a four color no according to the capacity of the work so that is for these brahmanas as if they came from the heat they formed the head of the god in the purusa there is a very famous uh stotra in the veda it's called the from the hate the brahmanas why hate because they are a thoughtful people the they think the muni rishi the mana sheila they research constantly not that all people can do that activity aptitudes are also not there so all these difficulties so accordingly some people are very very perfect in that so they will be constantly thinking and researching and taking out some prob uh the solutions to the problem the brahmana so these are the four burners though now afterwards i don't know when uh that it started the thinking that out it is from the family that from the brahmanas father the son will be brahmana it is not like that the karma according to the karma then bhagavan sri krishna also in bhagavad-gita very clearly he mentioned chathur burnham mayastristam guna karma biba gasha the bibhaga the division i have made according to the guna the capacity the quality and karma the work that they can perform so it is very clear in mahabharata is there in many other places references but you know society sometimes they accord when there is a turmoil there is no one can practically lead to the society some type of people they come and they do all their own way so this is the reason at prison the barna has become a we can say the very bad in the human hindu body but it is truly it is not so this one second it says the astrama and the asuma means again a human the in the beginning you should learn it then that that is called brahmacharya on pointed only learning is not going to any other matter now sometimes because you know some people in for their own personal benefit they utilize the youth group and youth means all the time fun loving they have a lot of energy and they go like that but the leaders of the society should understand this is the period that they should learn otherwise how they will be able to contribute to the society so the brahmacharya is a very very important period when they should learn learn and learn they should go to the teachers they should read books they should also contemplate so like that only develop then different type of types of the capacity also not that all the time intellectual there are many other things also they should but they will be able to contribute something to the society that is the period they should learn second that knowledge when they are joining the main force of the society contributing to the society as an administrator as a doctor as an engineer as a judge different and the whole human society the pyramid of the human society is built in that way and they will be able to contribute they will be a really asset for the human society the that is the main goal so second is garastha in the householder's life as the main thing is to support the old society because they are not only contributing their knowledge their capacity their understanding and leading the society to move at the same time they are earning something back and whatever their desires they will be fulfilling that that is the the grihosta and that time they are supporting the brahmacharis who are studying they're supporting those who are sannyasi they're supporting the whole human the society also by uh and their own society by paying taxes all so many duties are there for the household then afterwards when they are retired that is the another life the first two phases preparation for this present the worldly life last two phases preparation for the spiritual life so after retirement they will strive slowly to withdraw their mind now it's not the family all this mind that was all that they have given now they start collecting so bana prasti they will be leaving as maximum possible alone withdrawing their mind analyzing their life and understanding what they learned at the time of the brahmacharya that god is the only reality so concentrate on god or the reality so the one the truth that process will begin at the time of the banana prasti then finally sannyasa some mock nyasas and yasa so they will completely from there they'll resign to only the spiritual life and nothing else and completely give up their ego not me but thou that is the whole human life the wonderfully very excellently it was drawn by our ancestors the rishis still there but to some extent you'd have to and the main did because of the different type of flows have come but now bhagavan's rama krishna who has come to reestablish the dharma the righteousness and the main branch of the society is the householders and what the householder should do they should do pancha maha yagya which this panchamaha yagya bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning as the dates and he has not mentioned all the five in the in our scriptures he says what is that the very first according to the terminology used by bhagavan sirama krishna i should also say devarina you are indebted to the god we are all inducted to the god and then rishi reena the great scholars the thinkers they researched and they found the truth they taught us that those truths so we should be grateful to them then pitri reena because of the ancestors our family we are leaving we are surviving because of them we should be grateful to them mentioned here and i'm mentioning quoting from the uh the scripture we are indebted to the other human beings too the one who is standing over there and protecting me as a polish man that i should be grateful to him he doesn't know me i also don't don't know him personally but his presence is protecting me isn't it and there are so many ways in the whole society when we are going to the schools here of course it is all private schools we go and pay and learn but still the the government is also contributing a lot and what is that government money the tax money who are paying each and everyone is paying for the tax so when i am growing up each and everyone's contribution is there the teacher will be there the nurse will be doctor everyone is contributing i should be grateful to them too so i indebted to them so that is called reena and bhutarina the buddha means the other beings in all those beings should be there we all we are now the modern people they are all aware about it the we have to protect the nature even the ant has this contribution to survive the survival of this nature the birds then all they are contributing the bees also contributing and the animals each and everything so they are supporting us so human being and particularly those now in the second position now they have learned now they are earning now they are youth so that householders they should contribute how so they are mourning when you are getting up they should remember the god not much you know that you say they call it yangya yatya means doing something for the betterment of myself and others so what i am doing just looking at the pictures of the gods and goddesses and then maybe the burning the incense sticks and just remembering and thanking them praying to them god i am grateful that you have saved my life please bless me so like this like this a prayer those who have taken the initiations they know how the guru has taught them to pray a little bit of that that means we are remembering the gods and goddesses so here the it is not a capital g it is a small g so many good divinities that they are gods and goddesses we are remembering them and also the supreme god and that is called devarina we have or the young we are performing then rishirina rishi they researched and they developed our scriptures and in that scriptures very nicely they have said satyam bada dharma and slowly slowly human mind is getting the training and we are becoming separated from all other beings and the human is almost so close to god so that is the because the human can the the discriminate they can understand so that slowly slowly otherwise whole mind will go to the body and in this physical body what is there the all the animals and others only two how to survive that much so the food and fear if i get the food and i am afraid and so i protect myself that's all whole life goes on that but the human is not like that they are slowly slowly they will be developing their mind their thought process and they will go and merge with the creator itself so that is the uniqueness in the human life and so all the scriptures and the great souls they are telling the human life is really precious the manuscript this manuscript so only a few they are trying and those who are now we are listening or reading the gospel how many very few so even then those few people and also in different places and different type of scriptures they are studying so what we should do we should be grateful to the rishis they have given us that how by starting the scripture that's all so in the morning and the evening we are remembering the gods and by that way we are giving back to them our gratefulness that is sufficient and then as a our rishi just by reading the scriptures when you read the gospel of krishna is a great scripture and very practical so if it is possible to study the bhagavad-gita as well if you can understand because it is in sanskrit and there are so many varieties of explanations that makes an ordinary mind confused so it is better to read the gospel of sir krishna here you will find all the scriptures the summed up and third is the pitri reena we must remember our ancestors those who have given us me the life and and the identity in the society so we must remember those and sisters how sometimes as the traditional hindu they do they take a little water in the palm and they'll be pouring that water not that you have to go to the river where the river all the time you don't get the river just little water and then pour it thinking that i offer it this water and to you oh ancestors whoever he can remember the names the maybe the grandfather great-grandfather just remember and thanked them that's all and ni rina re means the other human being how we can help them that i suggest and previously i have seen in all the traditional hindu family they will be keeping at least one rupee or one dollar maybe a side the whatever they are going to exp spain for this day from that only one dollar they will keep and maybe you know there is let's call uh a separate place they will keep it accumulated maybe after five months or six months every day one dollar that means the 30 dollar and you 500 a dollar that will be good you can give it to somebody else to some and the organization maybe some oh the people the those helping the elderly people disabled people we can spend that money for that so i personally cannot go physically physically cannot help but monetarily but the main thing is i am remembering you all around me those people who are there who are constantly helping me directly indirectly and my whole life because of you so i also remember you so gratefulness so who is a human being who is having the gratefulness and then sartha also so here the then bhutarina and for them a little food if we keep for the birds and cover the animals a little water that is sufficient the same thing and sometimes you know the traditional hindu family and in the villages particularly they will go and pour little water for the trees they'll be watering the trees plants the flower the tree plants and they will give so keep some water and they're hanging in the from the branches so the birds can come and drink from there some special food for the birds when food for the the cows and all others that that way we are grateful so what is the training to become grateful humble the moment i think i am the youth particularly and i am earning a lot of money i'm getting some respect in the society i forget everything and ego becomes so big i think because of me everything is going on completely wrong and if the ego is pumped up what will happen i will suffer i will suffer that is the reason one must be careful all these moralities only to help me all the spiritualities all this training only to help me so this is the uniqueness bhagavan si rama krishna he is mentioning here that you have you are indebted to the society to the god to the rishis to to your ancestors to your fellow being and not only that that all other beings also we were there helping you to survive so be grateful so what is this the gratefulness then comes swadharma that is my own responsibility that i have taken up as a sannyasi as a monk there are only two things dharmapalan dharma shiksha continuously practicing righteousness i should not tell lies i should not hurt others like that like the humbleness so all those things we should practice and those things we should teach to the people high moral values in one sentence we can say the high moral values one should practice one should teach that's all so that is the reason there's sonia but the what the greece should do the mainly responsible for the family and that's why in those days the at the time of bhagavan sirama krishna the ladies were not allowed to go out to get education and forget about earning so obviously ramakrishna is mentioning over here the modern society ladies may be wondering why the husband has to support me i can earn but that was the situation when he's talking about it is the 18th 19th century the indian society girls were not allowed to go go for the education and forget about ironing so that is the reason the hearts husbands were responsible to look after that lady and suppose at the social the coverages social security those concepts are not there it is the husband only should be responsible suppose i die then what will happen to my wife how she is going to survive so to protect her one should have to do something maybe some there is too mainly this to purchase gold and the the jewelries the so that the lady afterwards can help herself for the survival so these are the swa dharma i am married i have to look after my wife and children but suramar krishna is mentioning ibdah is a chaste wife suppose she is not then the husband has nothing to do with that lady so that is okay now it is okay so this is very clearly bhagavan suramar krishna is mentioning and now here the girish is telling what is the way for people like us the householders as ramakrishna mentioned the now here the greece is telling what is the way for people like us bhakti is the only essential thing he is mentioning bhakti why bhakti the devotion because this is natural this is normal but if we talk about the knowledge very few people can really practice that very very few people that practicing the path of knowledge because the analysis is really very difficult but if you simply have the faith believe the god is there now we have to go to god how by putting your mind and soul at the feet of god that's all so this is called devotion god is there i am here god is protecting me and i have to remember god by that way this is the devotion i have to develop my love for god so soon krishna is mentioning many a times we'll be discussing about the bhakti and separately there is a book narada bhakti sutra that is a separately they are dealing with the bhakti the devotion so this is very natural instinct for every human being we love that love if we go to give to god that's called bhakti or devotion bhakti is the only essential thing bhakti has different aspects shaatik rajasik and tamazik the sudama krishna is mentioning so clearly now the devotion is there but there are also swathic devotion what is the shot you know the good qualities they're humble gentle and never will be aggressive so they will go on praying to god and wait patiently for the consideration of his prayer the god may or may not but they will be humbly go on doing that this is swathi good people they will be praying then rajashika they'll be showing up i love god so they will decorate the temple very wonderfully and all these things and the beautiful dresses for the images of the gods or goddesses and the golden jewelries for gods and goddesses he himself will be decorating like that it's all show up i am a devotee i am going to god i am thinking of god that's rajashika another is tamasika this tamashika here one who has the shaatik bhakti is very modest and humble but a man with shikar srama krishna is talking not talking about rajashika there is a in between the swathik is extreme one extreme and palmer she can other extreme the tamashika bhakti is like highway man in his attitude toward god he is not having the patience he will go to god and then they will say what is this name say he says oh god i am chanting your name how can i be a sinner so it is his demand if you have the tremendous faith then it is possible now the children they come and they called with the parents the father and the mother why because they know we have demand on them they're so close to me they are my father they are my mother so i have every right to fight with them they won't go to the neighbors will they no don't go to the friends father and mother no they won't do that so the first the basic thing when a person is coming and fighting with the god that means that that person has already developed the complete faith in the existence of god god is there i can talk to god and god has created me i have every right to demand everything from that is sirama krishna appreciating that sattva is always good at tama is always bad but when you are applying the tamasic attitude towards god in devotion suramar krishna says that is good how come i am taking your name and people say that i am a sinner if i take the name of god how can i be a sinner now this is a wonderful thing we should understand what is seen thoughts of the worldly objects the scene is nothing but the thoughts of the worldly objects including me and mine and when i think about god there's purity so when i am thinking about god i am completely pure so that is the reason jesus once said the kingdom of heaven is within you that purity is always there within you god has created the human being so obviously the moment we think of god pray to god then we are not going towards the worldly thing and we are away from the worldly thing we are pure so that is called purity and this tamashika bhakta with his great faith he goes to god and says what is it and there is a beautiful songs are also there one tantrica he is telling at the time of my death if i can die uttering the name of durga then how you it is possible for you to not to come to me to save my soul i challenge you shankari in bengal he said durga durga durga bole judi mori ultimately at the time of my death if i can remember the name of durga and i hearted that in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna the lord himself is promising he's giving the world so if at last moment you can think of god you are free bhagavan sirama krishna also he has also mentioned these again and again and he has given the example if you wash an elephant and then lose it and and immediately elephant means they love the dust they will go and play with the dust again it will be dirty but at the time when after the bathing and cleaning that the animal if you tie him then it will be all right so same way when you are going to die at that moment if you can remember now we may calculate so let us do whatever we like only at the time of death i will put the that iphone and the name of god and i will remember god no it is not possible the mind will never work at that time the mirthu the death is so much painful fearful the people forget everything that's why the practice all through the life we are practicing regularly if we are practicing we only say 108 times a day no that is minimum one should go on increasing the number and it is better if possible because most of the people nowadays they are working and the workload is too much so obviously 10 hours 8 hours 10 hours they are working and other responsibilities in this family but even if it is possible even for a day or two if you go to a secluded place and say that right from the morning till the i go to bed i will complete 10 000 japan the morning one hour i will do then little walking little refreshment again i will read a little book make my mind concentrate again i will do the japa like that if you can do every one hour you can complete three thousand so four hours if you can do the japa so 12 000 will be easy and if one can do 10 000 to 12 000 that means for our japa you can imagine whole mind will constantly because in the early morning then it is the just in the in the in the before noon and noon and afternoon and before that before to bait so that way one hour half an hour if you can complete that it is wonderful and the whole mind will constantly think of the god god god and god and what will happen as because your whole mind is in gun guard then you are pure masharadamani devi said these are the wonderful teachings we read so many scriptures and this vivek churamuni these that we are reading good but the main teaching it is lying with the in the simple words of maha sharada bhagavan sirama krishna and maha shardham and said what is tapasha baba my child what is that tapasha somehow we have to keep the mind at the feet of god somehow so that's why we are sometimes we are singing bhajan and at the time of singing we should not be aware how many people are listening to me whether they are appreciating or not no never never only when you are singing you should try to remember the meaning of the words of the song and when you remember those meanings that gives a great impetus and that is why the the kirtan in about the krishna kali kritan about the kali and different type of devotional songs that helps us to concentrate our mind at the feet of god so that is the way we have to that's that's called sadhana sadhana or spiritual practices doesn't mean only practicing uh the fasting or walking bare food that's good a little bit of you know the pressure on the body that is good in the beginning but slowly slowly you have to understand the main thing is the mind is not the body so whether barefoot i walk or with the shoe i walk it doesn't matter at all if the mind is at the feet of god then it is the people they go for walk and one hour they'll be walking at that time instead of talking to others or thinking other things if they go on repeating the name of god three thousand the god's name they can take and afterwards they'll go good three thousand name i could do and that have it will purify the mind so here it says that you have to purify the mind that is oh god i am chanting your name how can i be a sinner oh god you are my own mother you must reveal yourself to me so that is the prayer when we are praying we are not praying to the king unknown person why should he be afraid it's our mother only for jesus is a father for suramar krishna it is mother for us it is mother and mother is so close to us we can go and fight with the mother so that is bhagavan sirama krsna's teaching girish smiling it is you said who teaches tamashik bhakti kirish gosh he understood it actually cerama krishna is hinting another time shwata is best and among all the three qualities shatter always is good then the raja and not the tama because tama means completely negative but at the time of the attitude approach to the god bhakti devotion is there faith is there love is there now the force should be tamasika why why not you are my mother i have every right so that time i am not going to sit quietly oh mother when you are free can you please look at me no no no we have to you should look at me first i am your son you must so that is the claim that is called tamashika and girish smiling reminding the master it is you ser who teaches bhakti now srama krishna immediately teaching the devotees how you will know that you are progressing a spiritual path he is teaching in this next he's telling sirama krishna also smiling there are certain signs of god vision that means the god that i am going to realize god what are the signs when a man sees god he goes into samadhi i see god and i have seen these i have seen that that don't do he goes into samadhi and what is samadhi he forgets his own body and mind so that is very important what is samadhi merging with the object what is that object god so when i am merging with the god i don't remember that i have a separate personality separate body separate mind separate identity no it is all god so that is the way into the goes into samadhi there are five kinds of samadhi suramar krishna is mentioning and you know that the i gave a talk why should we meditate there extensively page after page every verse we studied of the yoga sutra there the samadhi pada that is the chapter in the different type of samadhis why we can't get the samadhi what are the hindrances everything has been discussed if you are interested you can go to youtube it is there why should we meditate so here siram krishna is mentioning the five types of samadhi what is that first he feels the mohammed that is kula kundalini power kula kundalini kundalini's means in the roundup is it sitting and that is the main that is the cooler and so that is the main power the force the air that goes up through the spinal cord and in both the sides of the spinal cord the yogis they say that they say there are two the strong knobs crossing all the time and different places of the spinal cord it goes down at the end at the end of the spinal cord and that is the main place where the latent power as if sleeping that is called kula kundalini sirama krsna says the bayou means the ear very powerful here and center of the spinal cord friends i am not talking about medical thing and medical science may not agree but it is yogic is a mystical and it says the center of the spinal cord there is a straight line goes up there's a sushumna so both side when it goes like this ilda and pingala and the central when it is coming susumna the susumna nadi that is the vein that is there from with that it comes how it comes first it says like a curling up like an and slowly slowly is curling up it you one can feel as if it is coming up when the ant is moving sometimes stop sometimes it will move so and like that it is slowly slowly coming up very slow second he feels as if like a fish is swimming that also goes up and goes down as the fish this swim sometimes at the one place sometimes up sometime down changing the cores like that it is slowly slowly coming up that is swimming the in the water third he feels it rise like a snake wriggling alone and that wriggling doing this it comes like a that's why this is the third one mostly the yogis they feel that the maha bayou the pranavayu and that is kula kundalini it is coming and like a snake wriggling all through and coming up if you have noticed the ramakrishna mission symbol the swami vivekananda himself the drawn it and that the symbol is the whole all around there is the snake that's the yoga symbol of yoga lord shiva is having a in a girl and as a having a that is a snake as the the girl the snake why it is hanging because he's a great yogi so this is the reason so that the snake is coming up fourth he feels it's like rise like a bird flying flying from one branch to the another it is jumping there is another type of feeling and the fifth he feels like the monkey making a long big jump and there are seven stages are there that from there when the last one the fifth one the monkey is jumping from one to another from muladhara to like this like this like this it goes very fast so these are the five ways the mahabhaya reaches the head with one jump as it were and samadhi follows when the sudama krishna is describing this we can understand he was master he was having all the experiences maybe the other others they get one type of experience and that goes the whole life and sudama krishna is the eunuch his mind is so concentrated so pure he was not having any other thought but the god so it was it became so easy for him to send that mind to the shahastrara every moment he could do it there are two other kinds of samadhi first sthita samadhi when the asparant totally loses outer consciousness he remains in that state a long time it may be many days and that is called stita stita means as a leaving stita samadhi and finally he says second und samadhi this is a different type of terminologies and different type of experiences it is the withdraw the mind suddenly from all sense objects and unite it with god suddenly with those who have practiced it wherever they are maybe they are in a meeting other people are talking suddenly they will withdraw the mind and goes into that and then again come back so that is all practices when the mind becomes pure again repeating the no desire for the worldly objects the mind is completely free and when there is no desire so obviously mind goes to god and he says in this way to aim do you understand this now this is a asking the master master the recorder of this do you understand this when you were reading those who have practiced meditation a little bit of experiences and at least they have the book knowledge that yes this is this this is this this is this they can understand when sudama krishna asking the master mashay he is immediately taking the exam of his very close disciple householder disciple whether he has experienced this or not master master yes sir do you understand this yes sir very clear answer master mashi was a householder he was not a monastic he had the family wife children used to work in a school not only one three schools and by that way so many so as a householder he had that swadharma his own responsibility to look after his wife and children so he used to work in a school and whatever the salary used to spend for that then he failed that he had the responsibility to support the cause of bhagavan sirama krishna and he to as a guru so guru pranami one should give some thing to guru for his cause so that's why master masha in those days he used to work for another two schools that was allowed in those days another to school salaries were not much more but look at the different work that used to do so much of time is to spend why to get some money and that money one portion is to give to the direct disciples of bhagavan suramar krishna who was practicing meditation and to become the monastic another part he is to give to maha sharadamani devi so this is called householders temperament the householders by this way becoming pure he is not only earning and spending for himself or herself is also thinking about the holy people and giving it not that he's sharing because in those days the salary was less he is whatever one school completely is to give to his wife to maintain the family but the other two in this two way that's why even though he was a householder he could say immediately to bhagavan not that intellectually has understood he had the experience so he could say to sirama krishna yes sir girish can you can one realize god by sadhana sadhana means spiritual practices now this is a very tricky question very good question if god is an object and i know these are the things i should do and realize god but god is not the object he's the subject that we are that that particular thing is over there so i can go and can pick that up object lying in some place so the time space causation all those things are there so i can achieve that get that the thing that i was not having i am going practicing something some manner some of the practices discipline and i'm getting that the girish is asking sadhana taking the name of god fasting visiting holy places so friends in this regard i just like to remind you so we published from vivekananda vedanta society chicago a very beautiful book if you are interested you can order for it not very costly maybe hardly ten dollar so the many ways to guard and there you will find the different religion we have researched on that and then published and the references are also there so where from the conception came who is the founder what are the practices what is the goal and at the end of the book we have given a of complete the table and giving in one place the all those things this is the religion the founder the year of the foundation and these are the practices if you go through the look at the practices sadhana austerity spiritual practices then you will find almost all the religions why almost all the religions are practicing the same thing the muslim the hindu the christian the buddhist fasting is common visiting holy places pilgrimage common then also the charity is common counting the name of god is common so many things are common and that is why whenever i talk to the other people i say if all the practices are the same result must be the same whether you call that particular result in in your own language that is different that's why our rishis long before they said the truth is one but the different people they termed is called it give the different names that's all bhagavan sirama krishna also said all are leading to the same goal but sometimes some people they call that particular thing as god or allah or jehovah or issuer so that the all paths are leading to the same goal many ways to god here also we find when the sadhana that we are discussing talking these are the sadhana now is a philosophical question can one realize god by sadhana let us listen to bhagavan si ramakrishna's reply people have realized god in various ways some through much austerity worship and devotion they have attained perfection through their own efforts perfection through their own efforts some are born perfect as for example narada and sukadeva they are called nitta siddhi eternally perfect there are also those who have attained perfection all of a sudden it is like a man's unexpectedly coming into a great fortune again there are instances of people realizing god in a dream and by a divine grace saying this ramakrishna sang intoxicated with divine forward can everyone have the vision of shama is kali treasure for everyone oh what a pity my foolish mind will not see what is true so suramar krishna is not giving direct reply to girish chandra ghosh maybe that the girish and the others they won't understand the certainty of that so he is telling but what is the truth what the philosophers they say what suramar krishna hinted over here that actually we purify our mind when we are purifying our mind mana should the karana as the vivek churamuni there it is a great stress has been given by shankaracharya that means purifying the mind and what is this purifying this process i won't eat controlling the senses i will go and to a holy place only by this way this way physically and mentally they are constantly becoming alert and not allowing the nature to drag their mind that is called sadhana by that way they become pure how again we are all the time reminding they are going away from the thought of the world and when the thought of the world goes away there is no question of ego because from the ego only all these things come i want i like to eat i like to talk i like to give all this ego when that ego goes away the sudama krishna's word many of you can remember ami mole when that i is dying dead then there is no problem because they are in original god is there i am not going to get it it is already there i am only removing the dirts which accumulated over there just removing that so can one realize god through sadhana of course but philosophically we are already god the how the sadhana can help us by removing the turds thank you friends i think if there is any question we will answer try to answer the first question is from akshay bhatia he is asking how to know what is god's will and act accordingly how to know the difference between my will and god's will there's a great question akshay that when your mind is completely free from ego and whatever the thought will come that is god's will but as because we are not ready i don't know maybe you maybe by many people maybe but if we are not ready to completely disassociate the ego then what we should do we should pray to god i am thinking to do like this oh god if it is your will you want then let me be successful if you don't want that let me be failure in this effort in this effort i should not be successful so that is god's will by this way we can apply thank you someone say sri ramakrishna is lord shiv does that mean someone can put bill leaves for shiveling and see shiveling as sri rama krishna too yes chaya the surama krishna is a shiva himself if you have read the biography of sirama krishna you must have noticed in the beginning itself it is mentioned that his mother chandra mani devi when she was standing before a shiva temple the shiva temple is still there it is named yugi sheba that when she was standing suddenly she was not worshiping he was just standing over there suddenly she saw waves of light is coming from that shiva temple and entering into her person she fell unconscious some of the other ladies her friends who were also there they got concerned and immediately they brought the water and when she came back to census she told her friends i think someone has entered into my body and i am carrying a child a baby so that is shiva shiva came as our son shiva thank you the next question is from devashi she is asking how fasting is connected to spirituality one who does not do fasting can they realize god of course they can realize god but the fasting means you know the controlling the senses and this is very strong feeling but of course the verse is if uh for some reason god forbid uh you have some diseases which needs the constant the food and all that then don't try or otherwise just to the control your senses particularly the tongue the feeling that i must taste i must taste you can say no today i am not going to eat and the best food that you like you know for 15 days i won't touch that so by that way only two have mastery over your mind that is the first thing the next question is from rohit he's saying what can we do for chittashuddhi oh it's a very good question rohit the chitta should the as we say that the purity is god the more you think of god the more your mind become pure that is chittas means the mind it becomes pure so if you have taken initiation go on taking the name of god that god your guru has given or you can listen about different different bhajans and read about the god and somehow you must imagine that you are going to different holy places offering flower and offering fruits to the god by that way always keep the mind at the feet of god as maximum time it must be working so you have other duties perform those duties and when you are free that time as maximum time possible practice your mind will be purified thank you friends now let us uh chant this mantra pranam mantra bhagavan's rama krishna and orders shanti three times and conclude niranjanam nityam anantharupam [Music] is [Music] namaste
