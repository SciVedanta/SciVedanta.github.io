[285. Panchama Veda 285 : Bhakta Also attains Knowledge Of Oneness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHEHvqbVs2c)

namaskar dear devotees and friends come let us start the panchama veda the gospel of sirama krishna with this mantra he has commented as a unique comment one may attain the knowledge by either path path of knowledge path of devotion bhakta sees that nothing exists but god bhakti also attains the knowledge of oneness of brahman this is really unique so that's why it's a panchama veda is the fifth way there is a unique knowledge so why it is because mostly we think only through the path of knowledge by nathi naiti process of nathi neity not this not this one can attain to the knowledge of brahman of oneness and when we follow the path of devotion it is obviously it is to the duality the god and me we are separate but it is not it is one the same knowledge of oneness is possible so we are reading from the page number 700 or the gospel of suramar krishna there is a translation by swami nikhila nandaji so he is writing bhakta does not explain away the state of waking dream and deep sleep now in the process of analysis in the path of knowledge this is a the very very valid and the only path where constantly you will hear that they will be telling and the jagrat shapna sushupti and beyond the shishup did there is the fourth stage that is that's called the chaturtham turya stage so this these are the way they so jagrat then we are body and mind and consciousness swapna mind is there consciousness is there but the body is absent and then finally and the deep sleep there is nothing neither the body not the mind only the consciousness so that consciousness when we come back from that consciousness it says that means there was consciousness every time all they will say like that so fast and the second they negate third they take to prove the consciousness the path of knowledge gana yogis and they will urge you to go to the fourth stage where only it is knowledge and nothing remains but the devotion part of devotion they include all those no exclusion they include all those paths also why i am all the time with god when i am just awake i see nothing but god so that is the difference so surama krishna is telling bhakta does not explain away the state of waking dream and deep sleep he accepts all the state further he accept the three gunas sattva raja and tama so from the path of the knowledge the path of devotion is different because they are excluding and here it is including so this is the difference and very unique way of inclusion this is not this is not this is not the constantly they say he said this is also the same god how they will utilize the sattva rajya and tama we'll come to know the in here itself bhagavan srama krishna will explain how they are utilizing the sattva raja and tama a bhakta sees that god alone has become the 24 cosmic principles that is the way they explain how the from the ultimate slowly slowly it came down as a 24 cosmic principles what are those in bhagavad-gita 13th chapter that sixth words it says in the gita and other other in other places also they have explained what the mahabharata but they are in a subtle form not in the close form this is a very subtle form and then the what are the in indriyas the the saints organs of action and knowledge the saints are organs five knowledge and five action to attain this is 10 and mahabhuta 5 15 pancha indriya gochara the objects of the indriya that is also five pancha means five indriya gochara rupa russia gandha it is the same way it says rupa the form russia the taste to the that way all the five so what happened five plus five plus five plus five plus ahm kara etc mona buddha cheetah four so twenty plus 4 24 this 24 cosmic principle so this way they say always explain 24 cosmic the shankar yoga will be always explaining like that it has come in this way first the circle and slowly it takes the gross form so from the subtle it grows that how sometimes they'll be giving the example see first we think that we like to purchase a car thought of a car it is a circle we have not purchased the car it is not physically there but we go on searching for the car which will be the best what is my budget and all those things then it is all in the subtle form car is there present but in a subtle form a time will come then when it will be in the gross form so that is the way 24 principles the universe and all living beings everything is nothing but the one was become everything he also sees that god reveals himself to the devotees in a tangible form which is the embodiment of spirit what he is doing he is thinking now in the previous day the other day we were discussing the the way of knowledge the the path of knowledge how the they discriminate and then go to that ultimate and that ultimate is the brahman which is all pervading consciousness and the second part is the bhakti karma and gyana is associated with both the main there are main two paths one is bhakti another is the gyana now karma means the action there also you are discriminating you are judging you are analyzing karma and here you are also accepting you are also analyzing you are also thinking so that is also karma and you are withdrawing the mind and pointing to god or to the brahman the yoga so that is the whole path four paths together but in broad it is two the path of knowledge path of devotion path of knowledge we have already discussed previously now ramakrishna is discussing the path of devotion why the majority of the people they can accept it otherwise it is really very difficult so when you study the bhagavata why the bhagavata was composed because of this when the sri krishna he was leaving his mortal body and going back to the eternal abode so obviously the rishis then the yogis they started asking questions where the dharma will rest how the general people ordinary people will understand the dharma then it is narada who inspired the veda of vyasa asks veda byasha to compose bhagavata so there were 17 puranas the bhagavata became the 18th purana and this bhagavata there he explained that the brahman the supreme brahman which is all pervading without any form has come down and has taken a form the nirguna brahma has become swaguna brahma and with all qualities so then the it became very easy for the ordinary minds or 20 people who is busy to earn some money and to maintain his family so then he can oh god is there he will have a small shrine in his own little house and before leaving the for work he will go and pray after returning back they will go and remain with the god pray to god by that way he's always connected with the god and by that way dharma the righteousness will be maintained so that the the pro that is the reason the our vedav viasa he composed the bhagavatam so bhakti came from there the devotion came from there but the devotion to whom god who is god only one then why so many particularly in hinduism there are so many gods and goddesses but the in other religions semitic religion they don't show the god in that way their god you don't know who is the god but they say you have to go through the messenger or through the son of god but the god is unseen you cannot go to god no one can see god it is not possible for you to know about god forget about the comprehending this is the difference but the in the hindu dharma they say no you can see god why not if god is all-powerful all merciful can't he take the form because he's all powerful he can do anything he likes so obviously god took this form and then he is coming down living with us behaving just like us and so that we can believe we can have faith we can go to him talk to him mix with him and we can listen to him we can understand him otherwise we are afraid so when someone is coming down with the uh the commandments that these are the things you must follow whoa that person who has commanded why do you write not to me what is the difference so these are all christian outcomes wonder when the god comes people among us so that is the way for the ordinary people then ultimately we come to know oh it is only the one and we are seeing many that's a mistake so that is called the vedanta vedanta teaches you the knowledge of oneness and to reach to oneness you have to pass through so many and when you are going and judging judging the many you find all those many are also not only appearance in reality they are all the same thing same quality the 24 cosmic principles which are everything the millions of varieties of the world that the hindus they have shortlisted only 24 the subtle and the gross 24 only even that 24 is nothing but the same one and to reach to that oneness there are two paths one's a path of knowledge and the path of bhakti part of knowledge it is a path of negation not these not these and pata bhakti inclusion these these these this is the difference now it comes over here bhagavan sirama krishna as because he is talking with the devotees who has so many other responsibilities in the society in the family so obviously he is giving them this path suggesting this path if you are a monk if you can shake off all the responsibilities you have only one pointedness that the god then it is okay you can negate you can negate you can negate no not this not this is possible for a monk a monastic but it is not possible for a householder then what they will do and if you say no house for householder only this much then naturally they'll think oh then what will happen but suramar krishna is coming and telling all this time the people who are telling the same thing and that's why the society were becoming so weak they were thinking what will happen to us we are the seniors we are committing this mistake we are committing that mistake there is nothing like that we do the mystic and they they call it scene it's not seen it is only the mystic understand the what you do when you are doing it only for your selfish motive that is the mistake great mystic why that you are differentiating the god and you just change that understand that and rectify that that's all sorama krishna is suggesting that and he is telling but a bhakta also attains the knowledge of oneness he sees that nothing exists but god he does not regard the world as a dream but says that it is god himself who has become everything in a walks garden you may see various objects but everything is made of works he's giving the example that we see this universe there's so many varieties are there but all are made of god if we can understand that realize that so much of joy god in the form of birds god in the form of trees god in the form of everything is a beautiful drama constantly going on all around us sometimes the god is playing behaving as a very crooked person and sometimes it's a very nice person all are gods good and bad so that is the everything so you are completely detached and you are enjoying the play of god when you go to the movie we see two types of character good and bad villain and also the good character the hero so obviously we support the hero because we like the good but the one who is acting but in his personal life he may not be like that a villain is just acting when you go and see and afterwards if we in person meet those two the hero and the villain what you are going to do are you going to hit the villain hey villain where you have come that means you don't have that analytical capacity we know that this is only the play next in next movie maybe they will change the character they'll be so just like that hit the scene not the sinner as they say so we should not do all those things which are really bad harming others creating problem for others those are the things that we should not do that's called morality and understanding the morality that this is the basis of spirituality what is the spirituality understanding the oneness and it may be called as god it may be called at brahman the the path of knowledge their goal is brahman the path of bhakti the goal is god but both are one in the bhagavad-gita sixth chapter thirtieth words i will read here also bhagavan sri krishna very clearly mentioning yo mamati sarvatra here mom means the god all-pervading god all-merciful god or powerful god it is not the krishna in that particular form it's the god yo mam pasti sarvatra sarvamcha he who sees me in all things yo the pure and impure in both that is the goal of a devotee ah oh this is pure and this is impure impurity should not take that's good in the beginning then ultimately you understand there is no purity or impurity it is only my thought that is the ultimate point where the the devotion should take and if we can't reach over there and constantly right from the six years to 60 years i'm going on thinking oh this is pure and this is not that means there is no development in my spiritual journey and what is the god realization the people always think something peculiar something miraculous something happening which i can't explain it's nothing like that it is an experience of oneness and how it will express in your character in your behavior through love the way you can love each and every one and those the students of swami vivekananda you know then one time he is writing to his brother disciple i don't know whether i have realized god or not but i can even stay with the devil if there is any devil that means my mind has become so broad and i can accommodate a personality like that be so selfish i can accommodate so that is called the spiritual growth this is called the realization the god realization doesn't mean there's some miraculous power not like that so this when you understand and how the god realization will be expressed will through me through love only and then i personally will become completely unselfish there will be no aorta of selfishness in me i won't think about like that oh if i don't keep touch with that man he's an influential person he's a rich man so i will get this benefit that will be no such calculation nothing for the work we go we approach to the rich people to for donation and for the and help the other people that's all nothing like that so this no selfishness so how we'll understand that we are developing in spiritual life love and unselfishness bhagavan sirama krishna is telling because you see everything everywhere bhagavad-gita sri krishna also says you see everything he who sees me in all things and sees all things in me he never becomes separated from me the god he never becomes separated that is the ultimate goal i like to be one with god i like to be one with the brahman i can i don't want the separation the moment it is separate it is true it is the duality there is pain separation means pain and the misery the i don't want that and how it is possible when i can see everything in the same line so it says that nor do i become separated from him so in this next again he is promising prana shati and in the next verse it is the 30th and the 6th chapter 31st verse also the same way he is repeating because this is the truth this is the ultimate teaching so he is repeating and another few verses also he who being established in unity after establishing in the unity what is this unity and always we say the ideal the motto or the mission of india is unity in diversity it is not the mixture of all the culture all culture should be separate they will keep intact their own originality speciality peculiarity but they should live together that is the specialty of indian culture it is oneness but oneness with many not that is a mixture you have to take this thing and that from the all good from here and there and makes a separate new something no not like that whatever you like your taste your food your culture your language your religion no problem for me only one thing that we should have develop respect for each other when you talk about your god i say yes that is possible why not when i talk about my god my conception my realization you should also accept that that much and nothing else only to teach this truth i am trying my hard and praying to god day and night to develop a home of harmony of course it depends on the god's will if the religious teachers because there is a very advanced age in the in the science understanding in knowledge the 21st century 22nd century is unthinkable people are now they are going to maybe for a long time period of time they are going to leave in and in moon in march they are going this is that age and we are still fighting over here oh this is my god and that is your god and come we will fight what a foolishness the shall religion lead the humanity or not if then the religious leader should understand that they have to calm on one dies and understand each other they need not to give up their own religion or faith the only thing they have to develop in their mind that there are so many paths to the same goal i call that goal as jehovah he calls at god and she is calling as allah or maybe that he is calling as bhagavan ishwara is all the same paths are different but the goal ultimately are the same and that is oneness and this oneness in everything isn't so beautiful that this is the strength religion is the strength religion is the basis of our peace and our progress so we must understand when we are reading the gospel of suramar krishna is not a sect it's not a separate book the few people who only will read and nobody else and then bible is a different sect should read and the quran and these tripitaka like that like that no all they are speaking about the one god only remove your own ego that's all oh i am a religious man i have understood everything this is the only way god is please remove that ego this is the utter foolishness the utter foolishness for the knowledge that is infinite and you are thinking you understood that knowledge isn't are you not shame of it so this if we understand that srama krishna is telling everything is made of the same but a man realizes this only when his devotion to god has matured i repeat this line the oneness a man realizes this this means the oneness when his devotion to god has matured now it says by constantly meditating on god the bhakta loses his ego friends this is the word again and again coming that when we give up our ego we can understand everything i like this there's no problem i like to eat pizza okay and he likes to eat italy there's no problem so this is the way if we can understand ah i see that he is enjoying the italy and i am enjoying the the other food peas are whatever we are all getting satisfied after eating oh i am full i am satisfied both are getting that then why should we fight hey full you are eating italy take visa only if you are not eating the pizza i will go and fight with you is it not foolishness the same way you must accept my god otherwise i am going to beat you the same foolishness so this is bhagavan siddharama krishna in this present age the lord god that brahman all pervading he has come and has taken the form of bhagavan's ramakrishna and he is giving this idea of unity in diversity so that is brahma rupa adi madhya shesha sarva bhasakam about him it is said everything is nothing but the brahman the sirama krishna he is the the brahma he is also the power of that brahma and at the same time he has manifested like this universe the world and in so many varieties but he is the one and he is teaching the oneness we must have to accept this oneness restraining keeping and nurturing our own faith we can become one how by removing the ego how only to understand god has created everything who am i to oppose that if god has created me god has created him her all beings who am i to oppose that hey god you should create me and my friends my family and nobody else can i dictate god like that isn't that blasphemy but we are doing that because of our ego and the more our we are showing like that we are separating ourselves from god we must understand that this is called knowledge knowledge of oneness and this oneness can be reached through different paths different religion now here bhagavan sirama krishna is telling the traditional path mostly the hindus they take the path of knowledge path of devotion even these two the followers of devotion followers of knowledge they will be fighting why i am better than you i am intelligent than you i have understood better than you this is the problem so sirama krishna is telling constantly meditating on god who is god is it only this form in the form of these in the form of these in the form of these that much the god the god is only as a krishna the god is only as a rama god is only as jesus god only as a buddha that much so that means he is a limited i am limiting my god that is also foolishness god is unlimited and he has manifested in so many different forms all these forms that you see he is and to teach us again he has come as a teacher in different time in different places in different situation in different forms and names and that all those great personalities so we should not say this is the only so that is the way we have to meditate on god god is all pervading god is all merciful god is all-powerful he can do anything he likes and he has given me this understanding that i am a hindu and i should follow the path of bhakti or knowledge and i will reach to god and that god after reaching over there i can see in everything okay this is for me that is sufficient for me and the same god is giving the idea to someone else in a different fashion different way let him go let him do it is his path this is so democratic this is so wonderful and that will bring the peace in the human society because not a single human is there without religion either these or that and this way or that way they are all influenced by the religion practicing religion but it is only the religion that is teaching love and unselfishness all religions so we have to understand that where from that love came because it came from the source and that is god the god is nothing but love if we meditate on god constantly that's why bhagavan si rama krishna is telling by constantly meditating on god the bhakta the devotee the asparant the student loses his ego i am separate and i i i that goes away and he realizes that god is he and he is god see the eunuch the god is he and he is god tami nishtita mati the ultimately the great devotee the mahavir anumanji when he was telling to rama ultimately i find that you is me and i am you so that is called even a devotee even a bhakta even a path of devotion can lead us to the oneness and it's as long as god retains the ego in man now sirama krishna is giving the practical suggestions what is that as long as god retain the ego in man i am not holding the ego god has given to me so you have to pray to god only to remove that ego oh god please remove my ego the god has given the ego and he is retaining that he should establish a definite relationship with god he should he must definite relationship should be developed what is the relationship calling on him as master mother friend or the like you know in the bhakti-sutra there are five so the five way because our emotion it goes in that way the motherly affection to the child the god is my child and the child can't do anything i have to take care of the child child is moving here running over there he may be in difficulty i have to go and help the child look at it god who has created this universe and the devotee who is considering as a mother of god mother of god and naturally as a mother our affection going to protect the gods a eunuch wonderful not that the god is the punisher god is sitting over there and constantly with a frowning eyes is looking at you the moment you do some mistake then immediately the flog you not like that who said that sometime by mistake we say we are afraid of god there sometimes in english the expression the as a devotee of god he is really afraid of god no not like that god-fearing person why should we be god-fearing person we don't we are not afraid of god because god is our baby our child we are the parents of god a father the mother we love that baby we are not expecting anything from god can a parent expect anything from the baby only the smile of the baby baby is healthy baby is happy baby is playing and parents are so happy can you imagine if you are developing a relationship with god in that fashion you are not expecting anything from god but a parent they are constantly long to see the face of the baby in the cuddle the baby is sleeping and the father coming back from the office will go and see the face of the baby will touch the nose will touch the cheek and that way expressing his affection not expecting anything from the baby that is the love for god isn't it unique and that has been developed by the hinduism he says you have that emotion a fatherly love a motherly attachment affection for your children utilize that forgot sometimes some parents when they come they say they we don't have child and we are very sorry we like to do this so i told why don't you take the god as your child of course it is very very difficult but the moment you think in that way as the whole world will change is all that you are thinking world is nothing but your thoughts so if you if you are thinking the god is my child and the same way a small little girl and she was observing a procession and people are dancing and they're the so much of light and music then she was asking the father what they are doing so they are going to married that man sitting on the heart's back is going to marry and i also like to marry the child the little girl and she thought something she is missing and started nagging the father no i will also marry i will father told okay okay come i will show you now they they were the worshiper of lord krishna then he took that little girl to the krishna and told this is your husband go and play with your husband and sing bhajan before him and cook food for him that little girl started playing with the god how you are my husband i am your wife she had no idea what is this husband and wife relation and she was so happy grew up couldn't forget that because of the constant meditation on god as her husband the god really appeared before her the krishna appeared before her as her husband and her mind was full with joy is the meera by the famous meera bhai there must be some books are there if you like you can read the biography of meera by the unique way of the expression and meera's understanding was so clear sometimes the path of devotion particularly those who are worshiping and claiming that they are vaishnava it becomes so difficult to talk to them and mix with them they because no i should not eat these i should not sit over there i should not touch that i should not smell that there are so many but the meda is so broad-minded why because the ego was already gone how by meditating on god on what aspect of god husband i am the wife and god is my husband can you imagine and bhagavan sirama krishna is telling that the you can think about the god is my master he is asking me to do this do that i will do that i am just i don't have to think anything the master knows what is good he is asking me to perform and performing and second it says as the mother and the friend so these are all the different relationships i spent one year as a handmaid the handmaid of the divine mother bhagavan sirama krishna is a unique personality and the only personality in the the whole history of the spirituality if the spirituality right from ten thousand years before when the people started thinking about god if that is the beginning ten thousand years and continuously different places different type of thoughts if you accumulate you'll find everything manifested in the life of krishna though he lived only up to 50 years within the 50 years everything the paths of devotion all paths and the paths of the tantra all the 64 paths and he was so attentive and so concentrated the moment he used to think that i should do this and used to finish that it takes long time for us so we may doubt how it is possible and we are struggling so many years and we have not realized god yet in that way how could he realize the god as brahman as kali as krishna as the jesus christ and so many varieties way how it is possible some people they doubt why not a very intelligent person even eight years little girl now she is now sitting for the exam for the class 12 and class 12 means you can imagine the age but she is capable she can understand it is possible in this life the why not in the spiritual life in the spiritual life also saddam krishna was so attentive so one pointed he could immediately realize that truth which is meant by this process and what is religion some of the practices if you are practicing these these these then you will reach to this goal and if one is doing that sincerely surely he will realize that goal understand that path why not so this sidama krishna he practiced everything one must worship then he is telling adia shakthi now he was talking about the devotion now he comes to adaya shakti that is tantra adi means the beginning the primal shakti is the power adi shakti anything that is happening is the manifestation of the power without the power nothing can happen so obviously the tantra the tantric another branch of the religious group of the hindus so another branch they have developed this you are talking about god but god is only knowledge so what about the power of god that is doing everything so they developed the tantra the he is telling adi shakti she must be propitiated she alone has assumed all female forms friends you know in our tradition ramakrishna tradition we always consider mahasarathamani devi i am showing like this because there is a picture you cannot see that but now that is that there's mash devi the she we always consider as the primal power bhagavan krishna worshiped heart and one day when the mother was asking sirama krishna how you think about me immediately he said as the mother who has given me birth as the mother whom i worship at goddess kali in the temple you are that same mother to the one wife he said so this is the understanding a lady doesn't mean a completely girl doesn't mean completely different majority of the people whose bodies own whose mind is only in the body they always consider is a male and female they always think that is a as a source of enjoyment but in the spiritual life that is completely different so ada shakti the primal energy and that was manifested to the marsh devi and this mother she is holding the key of all success the bhagavatam krishna again and again said if you want to get something you want to have something go to mother and pray to heart you have seen if you have seen the dakshina kali dakshina murthy the famous image of the kali temple in dakshinesha you will find that the right hand the both the right hand she is having four hands makali right side both the hands and the very benign and very compassionate one hand is showing like this that means i bless you you need not to be afraid of what do you want i am your mother and if the the children are asking for anything the boon the second hand the right side the lower hand is showing the here take it i want success i want wealth i want health i want these i want that come to right side and the same mother is also giving if you turn to the left but completely different the right side is giving the blessings and also the boon and left side if you go holding a shored and a shivered head the human head the head he she has not killed it is all symbolic is the head is the symbol of knowledge and the soul is that power by which you cut asunder the ignorance what is the ignorance i am separate than god that is the ignorance if you the moment you cut that you get the liberation so left hand side is for the liberation and right hand side for the enjoyment of the world so both you can get from the mother so that is why the dakshina kali and bama kali bama means left when you go for the liberation your mukti i don't want to get the joy of this world then you have to come to the left side this is the beautiful way that we get the kali bhagavan salaam krishna worship that kali and he wanted to rise that knowledge so the people can understand it and here it says is the primal energy this attitude of regarding god as mother is the last word in sadhana what is the last word this bhagavan sri ramakrishna i have underlined it this is the last word in sadhana sadhana means the spiritual practices sometimes we are fasting sometimes we are visiting holy places sometimes we are listening to the the discourses reading holy books meditating praying so many things we do only to get the blessings of god and the ultimate thing if you can develop this attitude the god is my mother then everything is over what is the baby is doing this is sudama krishna adding there are five traditional ways then here suramar krishna is adding shantanu the shantana means the children the child and what the child is doing only having the faith that the father and mother is there that much and sometimes the child will call with the parents he will say though no you are not loving me properly you are not carrying me this way you have not given me you have how dear if the parents they say go out then what will happen to him but he never thinks in that way when you are talking with the mother we go on fighting with the mother never thinking if the mother just turned the face and say from today don't talk to me you are nobody to me what will happen to me but the child is not thinking in that way at all why mother and that faith faith and faith bhagavan if you develop faith in that way then everything is achieved what is that faith lord is my mother lord is my father why should i be afraid of the father and the mother and all the time why should i have to go and beg oh mother you are so beautiful you are looking good oh please give me one dollar can any child will do like that never they'll go mother i am going out with my friends i need ten dollars give me right now like that they will say so that faith if we are having the god is taking care and what the parents they do they take care of the child friends approach is the mother to child i am the mother i am the father i am taking care of god that is one and the sudama krishna is introducing i am the child god is my mother god is my father the mother will take care of me when the children are going out mother will see hey you have not put on the socks and you have to put the shoe that is a muddy road you should not go like this and then she will bring the dress and put that properly but the child is eager to go to play and he will go like that but sometimes he will turn back and see the mother is waiting for him the mother is at the back then the child is fearless the mother is there she will take care of me and that is the end of all sadhana the why should he be afraid that's why bhagavan's rama krishna is telling in the devotion there is a the sattva raja and tama and the tama he will go and fight with the mother sometimes i tell devotees why you should not ask all these things to mother the she has put me in the in the in the world and i see that my children are suffering to whom then i will go i will go to the mother the divine mother that you have given me this and i am looking after now i am suffering please help me and you can of course demand so that is the teaching of bhagavan sirama krishna friends we will conclude over here today this is a beautiful idea now god can be approached through any path and god is one and all pervading he can be approached through the path of knowledge where they say not these not these not these that is the path of knowledge i am not the body i am not the mind shivoham shivoham that is their path and the others they will say oh god has given me this mind god has given this body god has given this my friend and these beautiful the relatives god is everything so the positive way so one path is the bhakti devotion another is the ghana knowledge so then srama krishna is telling that you must meditate again and again on god and what is the object of meditation god and what is that god all pervasiveness not the one that is the main problem i worship krishna in the beginning it is all right but if you think krishna is the only god then you are making a great mistake because the same krishna is telling i am everything i am everywhere you am so that is the way we have to think breaking the narrow conception narrow idea about god and now that krishna is all pervading when you are meditating on that you don't see the krishna but he is manifesting everywhere everything whatever i see whatever i perceive is nothing but my lord that is also oneness inclusive everything and but you have to meditate a lot why otherwise your ego won't go and the ego is there and he will say no my lord is only this much this is the picture i got from my maternal uncle or this my grandfather so this is the only god in our family we are not going to worship anything not accepting anything you are entering into the narrow channel and you will reach somewhere but here bhagavan says god is everywhere now finally he says you must worship atya shakti and concluding and we will discuss we may discuss on this if you can think that you are the child of god then that is the ultimate of all your spiritual practices thank you friends is there any question yes the first question is from devashish he's asking how to adjust our mind when we are living or interacting with selfish people on daily basis or we cannot avoid them as you mentioned there is only one oneness oneness is okay see oneness that is called the babuharika the babuharika that is the practical way when you are the god the tiger is also god but shall i go and embrace the tiger no so that bhava harika as long as i can feel buddha can go because when the buddha is approaching because of that purity even the the angulimal that at the great dekait a killer he transformed he was transformed that is possible for that person when we reach up to that it is okay otherwise bhagavan sram krishna himself taught you should behave with those people according to their character if they are a very cunning type of people you should be very very careful when you are talking with them dealing with them but inside your mind you should always pray to god god they are ignorant please bless them please bring the good thoughts in their minds too that's why you have to protect yourself and at the same time help those people who you think they're very selfish type that will be all right the next question is from sheila she's asking how does one do puja for ramakrishna faraham sir and then the second part is can one still worship other gods see the there are only one god but if you feel of course you can do the puja to other gods see the ramakrishna mission that there is a book and the puja padhathi in english and in bengali and hindi so ramakrishna puja put that it is available and there the steps by steve it has been that they have taught how to worship sirama krishna so your first question how to worship sirama krishna you can learn by reading that book the worship of krishna the book is available second whether you can worship other gods and goddesses of course why not you can worship other gods and goddesses and you have noticed in the ramakrishna mission also we worship all gods and goddesses the dulga the kali the vishnu and narayan all the gods and goddesses we are worshipping thank you the next question is from akshay he's saying what is the difference between emotionally turning towards god and really turning towards god so emotion means you are thinking oh the my father told my mother told to go to a temple i should go over there uh okay just to make my mother happy i'm going to the temple that may be emotional but if you understand the before birth where you were after that death where you will go the peers sorry not you people you live long so after that where the people they go and how things are all happening so this way you will come to know that is already analyzed and the conclusion is there is some intelligence factor is there and that is called consciousness by the vedanta and that is god so when you understand this then if you try to understand god you have two options as we are reading over here one the path of knowledge and of that the path of devotion anything you can choose thank you the next question is from biswarup he's saying if srirama krishna as well as you caught my hand is there any fear in spiritual life but you say me i don't know about me if i'm holding your hand but if sudama krishna holding your hand there is no fear at all no fear at all in the spiritual life you will be always see we are gurus we give initiation but we only offer to surama krishna we say you understand you know better please support and help this boy help this man help this person so this is the way we always say of course we pray pray for our disciples but we pray to sudama krishna he is the supreme lord and is as i was telling the god means full of compassion full of love don't be afraid you are not doing anything wrong the anything that you are doing anything you go and tell god i am feeling like this to do this so please guide me as a compassionate father he will guide you believe it thank you friends let us now chant this mantra and conclude [Music] [Music] [Music] namaste
