[38: Panchama Veda 38: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJa3Wy4Xcso)

so so so let us begin with sin effacing utterances brings life and hope to those scotched by misery they are extrolled by the wise says and the mayor listening to them should bestow auspiciousness on all they confer every prosperity those who sprayed them broadcast are verily magnanimous last time we were discussing about some of the questions the master moshe was asking sirama krishna replied to those and we know the first question that srima master asked what is the meaning of god realization the most of the time we always speak of the god realization but what does it mean and siram krishna replied to that from the upanishad we know that story we referred the conversation between the balkan the gargi and there the question is the gargi asks the question what is brahman and this question cannot be answered because it is a subjective knowledge so obviously yankovalkar threatened cautioned gargi almost the same type the god realization master masha is asking what does it mean but suramar krishna giving a straight answer and he's telling see the thought the idea of god realization different for different type of people and the first is just starting in religious life prabhattaka in sanskrit it says pravartaka is beginning for him god realization god conception totally different but still he is also having some idea of god realization swami vivekananda afterwards in to explain he said a person standing some corner of earth when looking at the sky and see the sun he sees the sun when he gives the description of the sun that is also correct and the person when on high up in a maybe in a aeroplane observing the sun his experience is different but the same sun and those who are very near by rocket reaching over there different but the same very sun so similarly the pravrttaka the first one who is explaining god his idea and the conception of god will be different but also true it is also true but not complete so when you we are talking about the god realization who is asking who wants to know that is the question do you have really some background do you understand then only it will be easy for you when someone said what is god realization to ma saradam devi jamal we are practicing religion for such a long time practicing austerity and whatever you said we are also practicing those things but we are not realizing god what is the conception of god realization then mother replied very nicely sweetly she said do you think after god realization you will grow to horns on your egg nothing is going to change in the physically but mentally the attitude will be perfectly changed completely changed your idea of life and idea of the world will be changed that is slowly the conception changes the first the prabhuta kadinda sadhaka practicing practicing practicing he gives some experiences and slowly the faith comes then comes the siddha known from his inner experience that god exists that is the important thing no doubt the moment we are having some doubt so much we have prayed to him and did the puja then why all this thing to me and like this they are pravartaka because they don't have the complete faith in god so this is the wonderful suramar krishna explaining the panchama veda is the gospel of sirama krishna and veda means the knowledge again and again i try to say this some people ask me why you have given the name panchama veda what is this is this mahabharata i don't know this is gospel of krishna katha because it becomes so easy to understand the spirituality really religion god god realization after reading this gospel of krishna the more we read more we practice more we understand in a better way then comes siddha siddha supremely perfect and this type of people they spread religion they leave religion they are perfect people supremely perfect the similarly we also mentioned in the vedantic ideology then brahmavid the brahmavid the person sometimes we cannot understand why this type of behavior he was also a god-realized person then why should he behave like this because he has realized god but at the same time the previous attitudes the samaskaras impressions are still there that is why he is also behaving in this manner so this is the degrees so we should not say they are all equal they have the degrees from the same university be from the same subject in the same subject same year people are graduating but the degrees of understanding and the capacity to explain the subject are different man-to-man person to person so similarly in the spiritual world also the sid fast the is has because we come away from the family and the worldly life so obviously we always think as the shankaracharya we read all these things and nothing so all as because we have left the heart and home we have a temperament not to go and not to be attracted by the things of the world but there are people who are attracted and happy with the things of the world so this is the difference of ideas and the thinking process we can say the one lady who was a was the daughter's marriage was arranged she was very happy she was a devotee she came to assam to get the blessings and unfortunately met a boss brahmacari who newly joined and they don't the devotees they cannot differentiate so they came and with great joy told swamiji please bless my daughter that she is going to get married and immediately this brahmacari he has started his religious life in the beginning so full of all these thoughts and without considering anything he said you have suffered in the world after marriage and again forcing your daughter to suffer in that way don't you understand the god realization is the goal of life etc and she was taken aback and afraid also what will happen is coming as a curse or what this somehow i met her i told no it is nothing like that it is all attitude and god is for all it's not only for the sannyasins but the great is also and it is the children who wants what that is why bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling mother knows the best some people they like to get the curry richly prepared with ghee and butter and chili and all that they like it nothing wrong and some people can't digest that they will have only something boiled mother knows it best so naturally it is different because of that this prabhutaka and sadhaka they are the beginners then the moment they become siddha a perfected one but the perfection also again impression from the past they are carrying that we have to understand then the last third question that he asked in order to realize god mastermasie asked what is the meaning of god realization then the second he asked what do you mean by god vision and obviously he is asking that god vision means these are the differences third question is coming how does one attain it god realization god vision how does one attain it so practical questions and cerama krishna immediately he is telling you have to take an attitude anyone can realize god see here is the difference between others and bhagavan siram krishna he is not prescribing one method you must do this no all the the previous the god realized soul or abathara and those who are great in the spiritual world either the shankara or caitanya mahaprabhu or so many but they are only prescribing one path for all whether you like it or not that is the wrong thing but here bhagavan sirama krishna is telling that you can go through or go to god through any path whatever you like then he's suggesting the traditional paths like santia dasya sakya batsalya madhura then afterwards he is adding santanava the attitude of a child so here the santa means sages those were discriminating margi so they will be constantly discriminating oh this world is illusory yada teen call me some of the saints will say this world is not as you see it is only you are creating drishti srishtivada you are creating the god world was not there you have created only there was only a small tree and you saw so many things over that the only one a gentleman was telling about the ghost story that they were coming it was a dirk and a night and they in a long distance suddenly they saw and they're hard and that particular area is haunted the moment they reached over there that thought the stories all crowded their mind their thought also came and someone told stop look at that isn't something very peculiar they all saw young people but started trembling everyone was afraid as a lady with all covered head white calling them beconing them like this and almost all of them they wanted to run away then the gentleman who was telling he told i hold their hands and said we are so many why you are afraid let us go she is calling us let us go what will happen we will also die that much let us go somehow he inspired his friends and one step two still slowly slowly they reached over there they found a banana tree and the leaf of the banana tree is just moving like this and the reflection of the moonlight a little moonlight is has come and the reflection is over the banana leaf it's just like the white and when it is moving it's as if someone is calling uh by the corning like this calm come like that so it is all imagination they went over there oh this is nothing again they got back their confidence and courage and was happy they could discover so this way when we discover this the world is nothing but illusory they are happy and that is what is god realization happiness peace whenever there is fear the fear of losing fear of acquiring getting we all suffer when you are thinking i have to get that but immediately i calculate shall i will it be possible how to approach and all this thing tension fear but when you don't want anything there's no fear no tension who is going to be the president of america i don't bother so i don't have any fear anything but those who are running after that they will be collecting fund collecting friends then they are also keeping contact with the media so they are also spreading so many things they can't sleep so obviously what is the problem desire if you have the desire to get you have to suffer you don't have desire no problem at all so that is why mother's solution to all the life's problem if you don't have desire you realize god you are not having any desire for the worldly things then what left god very simple but can we become desire free that is the question something or other desire will be always there from a childhood the moment the consciousness come we want we want sometimes we want mother all the time we want to be on the on high lab all the time then the candy then these then that slowly slowly so many desires will come the more the desire more we are suffering so what is spiritual life going back to the root what is the root no desire bhagavan sirama krsna said god realization is the goal of human life and what is god realization we don't understand what is god so many people are ideas about god mother sharada devi she said peace is god god realization means peace if you want peace then don't do all this so naturally peace is the ultimate goal which has been described by sirama krishna as god how to realize that swami vivekananda said if you can see the divinity in all being then you get that so three are approaching to the same goal in three different way but ultimate that peace here we have to reach god suramar krishna is telling us means the approach of the sages they're very quiet calm they observe all these things see and not affect it because they are not attached then comes the dosha a person having every quality all quality was he is thinking i am the servant of god and this type of person they are doing everything at the same time giving the kadhi to the master like hanumanji a classical then the comes shakya this is the beauty of the hinduism you are approaching god and thinking god as your friend and you can converse with friend you can tell him so many things you can argue with the friend and that is the attitude of the arjuna constantly he is talking with krishna as his friend tenting swami vivekandhus to call her miss mccloud she had that attitude to xiaomi vibe and she was not initiated but totally hundred percent friendliness she did so much much for swamiji very influential lady very capable lady and she organized all the meetings in different places for swami vivekananda she is to organize the high society people and she is to invite swami vivekananda to speak and slowly slowly the vedanta sprayed it in america so quickly because we can say the credit goes to ten time tanking xiaomi vivekananda love to call her tentin miss mccloud joseph in mcleod and she used to go her shoes on in the room of xiaomi vivekananda where others they are putting off the shoe she don't know my friend's room just to go and sit on the same chair of swami vivekananda nobody thought anything because that wonderful attitude so the attitude of shakya then barcelona this is easy for the motherless people they naturally love children so much and that love love for the children if it goes to god cooking for god preparing dresses for god the other day i found a lady she has come and holding one small something like that i was thinking her back i told you you can leave leave it here no i cannot this is my god she is caring god all the time everywhere in this modern age in america and she is practicing that way it is wonderful and surama krishna's time there was a lady who became wedo at the age of almost six or eight and from then onwards she was thinking that krishna should come as a son agar mani devi then afterwards he became very famous as gopal herma gopal means the krishna and gopal's mother she she came to see sirama krishna and she was not much impressed because ceramic was going on asking how many types of cooking you know can you prepare food like this like they do and she when she was going back she was thinking what a sannyasi constantly asking about the food and discussing our food there's no talk about god or anything and she was not much impressed but when she went our prayer that krishna should appear as a small child and play with her be on her lap that was fulfilled when she was closed i was praying to god suddenly she found someone a small little kid laughing jumping running touching and she forgot that it was the god and she prayed for 60 years for that and even she was beating the child scolding the child forgetting that it was krishna our own god so that is the beauty of yashoda we find that she she knew that krishna is nothing but god but at the same time siram krishna's mother also found so many uh the experiences got the experiences that sri ramakrishna is nothing but god he she kept the small child on her bed came out and when entered she found a huge person all light man hitting hands the vishnu lying on the bed and she came running out and told something has happened to my child not caring for the vishnu or that darshan she wanted god as a child of course swami vivekananda's mothers also prayed that shiva should come as a child but when we became the king and he he was so naughty then the mother used to say i prayed to shiva to come as a child but by mistake she was saying a demon his follower as my child so like that but a very peculiar thing the small child so naughty it was so difficult to pacify him moment you say if you are behaving like this shiva will never allow to enter you in his abode immediately will be cool or if you are pouring water on his head immediately so this proves the existence of god the personal god the conception that hindus have developed so one attitude if we are taking and proceeding then come madhura very difficult attitude which radha was having and some of the lady saints we find they were also having the same attitude towards krishna as their paramore as their husband so this is so many way one can go this is the beauty of the hinduism but master mashay as because he was modern educated so he was constantly doubting and he was talking with sirama krishna and he said when one sees god does one sees with these eyes can we see god with these eyes then sinama krishna said god cannot be seen with these eyes then he is ex explaining god cannot be seen with these physical eyes in codes of spiritual discipline one gets a love body endured with love eyes as a purity comes in the physically also and they forget that this is a physical body constantly they think this is the body of god sometimes some of the saints we have seen that decorate the body and people sometimes they misunderstand that but when they are decorating they are not decorating their own body they are decorating the body of the god because they see god with him constantly and we try to do that by offering our food to god and then partaking when we are meditating we try to see god within our heart then slowly we are transforming to god itself when we are doing the puja the hindu pujas the priest are supposed to think that he is nothing but the god devam devam i am god myself i am worshiping myself this is the vedanta and the advaita vedanta sometimes is practicing in very much dwita when we are worshiping the god we see it and then try to think i am nothing but this god i'm becoming sudama krishna myself then worshipping sirama krishna i'm becoming kali myself and then worshipping kali so this is the approach deva muttwa devam and then you can see god then afterwards he is telling but this is not possible without intense love of god don't think it is possible simply you see sometimes people can imagine you will see when you are imagining imposing slowly slowly your behavior attitude everything changes in the worldly life also if you observe some of the young people particularly the teenagers they are impressed by the heroes of the movies they will be practicing his favorite hero how the hero is walking he will also practice that hero is walking only in the cinema in that particular time but this fellow he is so much impressed he thinks that that is and they will be having the haircut of the heroes if you go to the these shops they will keep the photos of different heroes having different type of hair cards so they will have the hair cut they will have that type of attitude they'll try to speak also in that fashion and slowly slowly they think that they are also in this that person similarly in spirituality also when we are imposing the godliness that purity that love within us we also transform then we forget that we are this materialistic body and this type of all our things we forget that is called and that's why it's ramakrishna is telling but this is not possible without intense love of god one sees nothing but god everywhere when one loves him with great intensity it's like a person with jaundice surama krishna is telling who sees everything yolo then one feels i am verily he through the dwita through worshipping the personal god one becomes advoita he becomes that god himself and that is the reason when the radha was constantly thinking she is different than krishna krishna never came to her in the beginning krishna came and slowly slowly when krishna wanted that she should feel that krishna is everywhere including her she was not ready to accept it then the beautiful way in the life of krishna when we read very charming but most of the people that misunderstand it because the way their expression the expressing the divine play then the radha went to dance with the krishna at one time she saw where is krishna krishna is dancing with all other gopis and she naturally in the worldly way she was angry she don't want never wanted to talk to krishna never wanted to see him all these things went then ultimately when she understood one krishna with everyone that means krishna is all pervading and then she started seeing krishna on the grasses krishna on the sky krishna on the trees krishna and everything she found back krishna and that is the julen there that swing that they are having that is the melon it is not a male or a female it is the devotee and the god when the devotee thinks that i am the god myself and god is all pervading whatever i see is nothing but the manifestation of the same god that is called the perfect realization um in the bhagavad-gita it says and the same god is telling sarva dharma and paritta mommy comes i am only one and that is the way jesus is the way and the moment say we misunderstood it that means how jesus prayed to god way means the practices of jesus knowledge of jesus experience of jesus teachings of jesus that you have to follow but we took only the person we accept the person or then that means i have to only go to jesus no not like that jesus is the way the moment says krishna also says sarva dharma and who is that krishna all-pervading god yumam pashiti sarvatra so we have to understand totality we have to understand here sirama krishna is telling when you are worshiping you are becoming god yourself and after doing puja worshiping god or practicing religion how can i be angry with others how can i criticize others how can i try to harm others how can i kill others is it possible that means the sadhana the young lady came she is doing some research in chemistry she was telling that i am trying to do so many things but because she wants to develop some process she told it's not coming i'm so frustrated and i was working day and night then i thought let me go to awesome and spend the night because things are result is not coming and i'm becoming slowly losing the patience let me go she came stood uh stayed the night prayed to god she's not having so much of faith but still she came i told go to god pray to him and maybe that suddenly someone will come maybe your guide will come professor will come one little clue and you will be successful so it goes like this when we are going to god trying to realize god god is all the time away so difficult to realize and not only that he will create all difficult problems also and sometimes in the mind the devotion becomes so dry and we wonder oh i don't want god at all how come i don't like to take the name of god why what has happened to me i can't pray i can meditate i can do can't do japa i can't rather read also what has happened to me these are all god tests and you have to go on praying to god only then only you are saved when the mother is beating the child child is not running away the if the child is running away there is another chance of getting the beating but if the child is hugging the mother then the mother herself will take her on the lab so that is the way you have to go to the root when there's a problem usually we always say oh there is no god why should i have to pray to god wrong when the difficult days we have to go on praying and try to say that i am you only then why you are giving so much of trouble to me how come that i am forgetting you that is what suramar krishna is telling in all the approaches madhura and the attitude of the child bathsalia that is also all time we have to have two things first foremost conviction that god is their faith and second i am the part and person of god maybe right this moment i cannot realize it but that is the truth and someday i am going to get it i am going to know it in bengali there is a beautiful song when we were young used to sing i used to sing janu nare moon oh my mind you do not know i am the son of god and all these things that you see is nothing but my father's property i am the here i am going to inherit all this bhagavan si rama krishna is telling only two things you have to know what who am i who am i this ramakrishna in the form of krishna who is he and then who are you what are our relations then he said if you come to me i will give you all my treasure to you as a father gives his all property to the son he will get everything think of it so that is how we have to approach birth it is not so easy you have to go on intensely practicing then is telling gopis were intoxicated with love exclaimed these gopis they said verily i am krishna they were so much ready to serve krishna when they found the krishna is walking on the road rough there are pebbles are there all the gopis lied down and asked the krishna walk on our body so that your feet should not get hard so much love and the same thing we find in the modern days when the mahasaratha money devi was coming i think she was coming from jairambati or going from calcutta to jarambati in those days she used to travel by uh in the horse drive the bullock cart they were rough so naturally the roads were also muddy road in one place it was dark night one of our swami trigunati namdaji uh i think i have forgotten that particular and he was also walking along with that he found that there is a road as a gap is there the it can go but there will be a big jerking mother is a slave inside the he asked that the person who was driving the cart i am lying over these you drive the card on my body so that there should not be any jerking and the mother won't get at the sleep brick she is sleeping she should continuous sleep mother got up because she is gorgeous she understood immediately got up and said what is it why you are behaving like this what is there suppose i get up and my sleep break i'll sleep again but you are sacrificing your life for that don't do it and you are saved see this the way the love you have to love god it doesn't matter what happens to me but i am going to protect the god and goddess the raja maharaja swami brahmanandaji he was going in a carriage and mother in another carriage with all other companions at the time of coming back raja maharaja he never used to talk he simply came running and sat in that particular carriage where mother was sitting the other ladies they started shouting what this raja is doing why he should behave like that now who will go and talk to him because his personality it is very difficult to approach him he was sitting quietly mother looked at him didn't say anything rather changed the courage the one which was for raja maharaja for the brahmanandaji she bored in that others also after some time this carriage which was supposed to carry mother you got accident as because only swami brahmananda you were sitting over there it got little hurt but suppose mother with all her followers ladies children what would happen to them that is why mother told i knew he is going to save us mother also knew but at the same time think of the sacrifice so that is the way that thakur is telling that you have to think in that way a master mashay all the time doubting he is listening but at the same time the question is cropping up in his mind the surama krishna was telling one who thinks of god days and night beholds him everywhere immediately it is like the flames it is like a man's seeing flame on all sides after he has gazed fixed at one flame for some time master master doubting sometimes when you were in intently looking into a gazing a fixture with a flame then afterwards we see the flame everywhere this is normal natural experience who has written this book the moment he heard suramar krishna is telling like that one sees god everywhere if you one can think god all the time he was thinking it's like this if you are looking at the flame seeing flame everywhere but in reality it is nothing he was thinking immediately aim is thinking and sudama krishna gave the answer who could read man's innermost thought immediately replied one doesn't lose consciousness by thinking of him who is all spirit so ramakrishna is giving the reply the moment this thought or the doubt the question crossed the mind of the master marsha he is replying it is not like that because it is a consciousness it is the spirit that you are thinking it is not unconsciousness master mashay understood it and then he is telling yes sir i realize that it isn't like thinking of an unusual object object how can a man lose his intelligence if he always fix his mind on god whose very nature is eternal intelligence and sri ramakrishna was pleased and he said it is through god's grace that you understand that doubts of the mind will not disappear without his grace doubts do not disappear without self-realization see the same sentence is repeating twice but in the philosophy there are two very different paths one is personal god there's a god god is their conception of god is there god the creator the sustainer the preserver like that and again then advaita vedanta there is no god conception there is no creator so obviously they think about the self their consciousness all pervading krishna when giving the answer covering the whole so the advaitin cannot say oh that was only for those who were on the path of devotion he is telling doubts do not disappear without self-realization and again telling doubts of the mind will not disappear without god's grace he is grace so he is covering both the points then master mashay again but why should god make us run about suramar krsna's telling but one need not fear anything if one has received the grace of god it is rather easy for a child to stumble if he holds his father's hand but there can be no such fear if the father holds the child's hand then he is telling this is everything is nothing but the god's play he makes he thinks that it should be the master master asking this question but why should god make us run about and this is the question is a very interesting question god has created both there is a in the gita also bhagavad-gita we find they are telling shaitara and shaitara there's two words shaitra the field and the noir of the field or the master of the field shaitra and there the god is telling i'm both shaitra and shaitra but the shaitra is nothing but this body and this world that you see outside world external world but if you understand the reality of the external world what is really it is see the science for so many hundred years going on experimenting what actually it is and going on getting new new thoughts suddenly they discovered some higgins bones and they said this is the smallest first they discovered atom and all over the world people who are rejoicing oh we have discovered the ultimate then proton newton all this came now the higgins born everywhere people were discussing about it and particularly in india mostly it will be published in such a way even the ordinary people they will be sitting in a tea shop and be reading the newspaper and will be discussing about the high scientific discoveries without mostly not understanding but some conception so like that only now they're telling the smaller also than these it has come then where is the end of it that is why in the spirituality long back they discovered that it has come from god or the cell or the atman or the brahman in whichever name you can call it describe it but you cannot understand it completely unless and until you realize it and the moment you realize it you cannot express in words or in any manner only you are giving some hints satchit ananda saruba so that is the thing consciousness when the master masha is asking why he is giving us trouble making us run if this type of fun and we are suffering sirama krishna is telling but who are you shaitra and shaytard both are nothing but the same god are you not god yourself so this is the but why should god make us run about immediately siram krishna said it is he it is his will that we should run about a little then it is great fun for him god has created the world in play god has created the world in claim as it were this is called mahamaya the great illusion he has created the world and this is nothing but the illusion and this is the point most of us we do not understand why because we are in illusion as long as we are in that illusion how can we understand that unless and until we go beyond that we won't be able to understand it so this is the main point of spirituality problem of religion so we are practicing religion we are going to temple we are going to all the holy places praying and doing so many things but still not getting complete confidence or the faith that i am that same why should i have to do all these things nothing can touch me whatever i am doing is nothing but god's play so i am doing it because i have been asked to play some in different places the people are in drama and the person who is directing the director he will ask the actor or actresses you play like this you see things like this you deliver the word and speak like this behave like this he's simply doing that and sometimes the director will come and rectify correcting all them some people are suffering some people are enjoying but afterwards it's nothing when i was a very young kid i was returning back from school in those days here and there they used to have the street dramas and people used to give a lot of money these people where from this to come we do not know but they will be dressing mainly as a rama lakshmana and ramayana sometimes and the rama that play was going on i saw some of the crowd so i also picked through i saw that rama is banishing shita and there's this kid and as shita is profusely crying and telling the police please and rama is adamant and someone took her and she went backward and there was some plants trees pictures of the jungle she went inside out of lot of compassion to help her i also went at the back side try to see where she is going what will happen to the poor lady i said where is the lady she has removed that wig and smoking as cigarette that was a shock to me so much in that i believed it so much then it came to me oh this is drama so this is the experience when we we are children and in this world we are behaving like children we are crying we are praying we are demanding we wanting all these things which will never remain all will go away and that only we will understand when you experience how by the grace of god again and what is that god next day and next tuesday again you'll study this yes ramakrishna is telling that the air is the most important thing shakthi the god's power it creates it gives mukti and also bandhan it binds so you have to go to that shakti there's a different aspect of god otherwise it is impossible so that is the reason we will understand that god suppose a person who is in the office he can do so many things when he is working but the same person who goes back to his home there if you go and approach him he said no i can do the same thing here you have to come and meet me in the office there he is displaying his power there he is the boss he can take the decision same person but in the home in his residence he is totally different type of person he is cleaning the his own car or cooking playing with the children uh just observing or enjoying the game tv watching tv so like this only if we go there and try to discuss the businesses no not here i am not ready mentally so you have to come to the office almost similar same god sometimes he is shiva doing nothing simply lying down if you go and approach the shiva we don't know not here you have to go to kali when i am working when i am active when i am creating when i am destroying there you come and that particular form has been framed or just to understand for our ordinary people kali mother that is the shakti god and his shakti the shakti is performing working but hindus they like to think that god shakti as women and the woman when we see that she is playing it is difficult to understand her and easy also to get the blessings from like this it is only game so we will try to understand this is the conception on which shocked the religion has come shocked the philosophy has come shakti so that's he will say the devotee assumes various attitudes towards shakthi in order to propitiate so this is where we will go and the next day i will try to understand this the shakthi is a difficult conception but we'll try to understand it let us pray of our pranam niranjanam nityam a namaste you
