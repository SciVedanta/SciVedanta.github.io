today the swamps non yatra d in the double-dot temple they'll be bathing the larger and not and as usual they'll be pouring water lot of water I think almost a hundred and eight pitchers with that they will be the jello not and then jagganath and his brother jonathan balarama they like to play like ganesha so they will put the the mask of ganesha on Joren not and balarama but at as naturally as they were bathing-suit such a for a long time they would feel sick so then they will go to a separate room and there they will take rest the Lord will take rest for 15 days and the all these 15 days he will take only medicine that is called par China boiling different hubs a one type of liquid thing and that the Lord will take and that is the prasada and naturally less devotees because who is going to the most of the devotees on go to take that type of prasada so that is the whole thing and on this particular deal also most of the deities they will be bathing cleaning actually this is a wonderful time this way they keep the temple clean inside everything they will clean up 15 days time the gate and our Tucker also get to be bathing all water and they'll be cleaning the image chuckles image and on this particular occasion on this particularly did the shisha temple and that was inaugurated there's also very early and on this day one of the very famous disciple of swami vivekananda Shami be region under it is his birthday tita tujhe village ananda g is the fast young man who came and joined as a sannyasi from outside in the Ramakrishna order where's bhagavan sri ramakrishna he was having some disciples you know all the sixteenth they became sannyasi monks and then there were many householder devotees but seeing these monks of course in those days it is very difficult to understand because there is no mod they used to leave only in a haunted house even then a young man used to come of course in the beginning used to come to get coaching from swami rama krishna and the G was a very good in mathematics to get the coaching in mathematics from that Swami the appearance is to allow is good this son will go and he will learn coaching get the coaching etcetera but when he came he saw and slowly slowly he decided that he will also become monk then they took him back and naturally the parents kept him in a closed-door room but still he was meditating he was not taking food then ultimately they agreed to allow him to become monk and this is the schwa me show me by rajan am the G he has a wonderful life if you read then afterwards he became the president of the Ramakrishna order and the long beard wonderful the Sham littell is a place where he did his practice T's austerities he was in advocacy ama then it was decided that he should come to America in those days but he wanted to avoid he told I won't go to America but the president order that time Xiaomi shivananda G he issued the order naturally what to do then he was hiding in a jungle in a secluded place that is shamla tall if you ever go to that side using ultracaan there's a wonderful place now as a hostel has come the as at all means a big pond and shamla that is the blackish to that he used to go on the top of the mountain still is so difficult to climb before coming over here I visited that is really very tough to climb that and then he was to go and see to her that mountain from there you can see the most of the part of the Nepal the gun dirty river is to sit over there and meditate morning he will go evening used to come down is to carry little food and drinking water it would be there so that way he was practicing meditation and the the whole Sangha they were searching him where he has gone then ultimately to they were thinking that he is not returning back there is no report to what to do then suddenly they came to know from some of the villagers that there is a great soul another village all the time the words that reaches the people will be gossiping discussing there is a wonderful monk very austere he is practicing the pasture so people started visiting so they came to know there is among so other show me is they also came to see and they saw this show me afterwards he himself agreed to come down to the plains and he reached b'lore mot the headquarters and the moment the president she remembered you sorry he said they will be the day different school so this is my RV is a very good player and one copy mr. an angel Savior mr. mrs. Sedgewick give a British they follow Swami Vivekananda all the way to India and then Vivekananda wanted a place where Europeans will come so that was the place they chose they purchased and the prepared a wonderful a stoma and believed over there looked at the once they take up an idea they lead to that idea and that mr. Savior captain severe actually he was the captain in the British Army and he passed away over the observe and still they buried him over there they actually the cremated him over there still it is there and the mother Savior she still lived over there for long when when she became very sick the girl monks forced him to come down and send him to London back like this so this is the wonderful places and the incidents now in the name of vagabond see Ramakrishna all people are coming and they are accepting his ideology they are accepting his philosophies they are getting joy in practicing but what is the debt philosophy when we read the last time in our last class we have discussed about the sannyasa this is the highest idea the human soul traveling and in the beginning we find that it is only the look this world that he can see he can touch it can feel that is only he is accepting and nothing else and slowly slowly his thinking capacity is developing and developed this is the development you find ultimately sannyasa today afterwards they made in a four stages of life the first is the brahmacari ivenga roster in vanaprastha then sannyasa this is a lot many descriptions and the definitions of sannyasa is wearing the bhagavad-gita it is also here in the sixth chapter which says what reason and Matthew too deeply the higher in the Mahan iran-contra the TV giving this is our economy now we use the container see what happens usual I stuntman them have Jionni somewhat funny when the Bromberg gianna the knowledge of German gone with the new you cannot do any work then Gaddafi it's all stopped working of thinking about others and all these that is only realities that we have to do something you have to achieve something you have to get something Oh God movies yummy Konoha telling y'all so you and similarly we should otherwise now the suddenly is because you know some people they just put on a Google and then you'll be declaring the tanzania takata that is not good and most of the UT in other places I went with a gustar a very good family they were in a local kings and they took me is still the Hubble you is to call the wonderful houses that is still there and they took me to all those places they are very very rich people still now and they were telling me that their grandfather we became a sannyasi he lived ordinary citizen great respect for the grandfather and the whole family of the calling ask another project Apollo it took me here Gong it's good but the Sun you see is a different type of thing the stages that be saved in the beginning it was alright but it says that you have to have acknowledged that way this is wrong serama Trishna thing this is the description that we find today as a chapter has been named by the translator advice to the brahmers see Ramakrishna was visiting Balarama in Calcutta this is think that in the life of Saddam occasionally find most of the other avatara's they never did like this particularly the just before see Ramakrishna 500 race because ramakrishna chaitanya mahaprabhu he never relocated and even like to also even if his disciples are visiting he is to shun them nice to tell them go from here but see Ramakrishna just opposite he is trying to develop that this householders lives also so this God Himself is going and visiting their devotees houses those who have already left raised the vibe graphy of Saddam o Krishna Andrade this kaatham Rita they know with so many people in Calcutta and around used to go and here he is coming to Balarama he was a very rich man he was a landlord this balarama boss but very humble very devoted very dedicated so see on occasion is to like him and he is coming and along with Sri Ramakrishna always used to take some of the disciples known people Narayan Rakhal acceptor Exeter used to take them to introduce with the devotees why because taku new afterwards something is going to happen that plan was already there he knew what is going to happen so he was introducing these young people otherwise Balarama then other Ram Chandra doctor they are all senior people they will never listen to this young people that's why see Rama Krishna himself was taking them and introducing and stealing feed them now and then that will confer on you the merit of feeding holy men look at it how he is introducing this young boy only sixteen seventeen eighteen the a book and they are all students see ramakrishna is taking there and asking these people to feed them now and then and he will get the medic because he knew that they will become all sannyasins the master wanted to hear narendra singh whenever wherever he winged he started with a song and then picked up a question answer and discussion and narendra as because he was a very good singer he asked him to sing not in the sang total five songs he sang on that date and then another young man baba not not in the sprint he also sang the another song over there and then afterwards master he was incredible another young man whom he is to like very much that is rock hall but the rock Alma Hodge who afterwards became the first president of the Ramakrishna order Shami women and the beef he used to do java used to practice jabber all to the night all over the net so that's why the daytime mr. fell asleep when he heard the Narain will seem so he took that opportunity and went in some corner and you see here when trading about the rock high but they would say he's sleeping said and say it once a man with under leaves are another in the villages would carry your own seat so there is nothing we see it so caring about to spoil agency so we wait then afterwards hitting that you can turn off here in time before the performance again because all he went to see the theater Maggie slave to all through he woke up and then he returned home with that man under regard to the purpose to come and live Oh Simon Dasha so the Hatti ages but most of the pieces what they do they could go for it particular purpose without attending the festival surface will they do something else in the meantime that was still in vine he's talking with the line see singam 2 different new more and they called it brahma samaj and in the drama so much they are educated people they have come to see Ramakrishna that is also a spatial thing the ramakrishna mission always this ideology this philosophy this practice practices appreciated and can be understood by educated people because it's brought the if you go and they say okay you come and they will burn the lamp and then show and then they will take it before you you are touching the fire and all these things that we see normally that is easy to understand you go to the temple it happens like this but when you come over here nobody is here to it dude any puja whatever you bring you to eat over there and then sometime it will be offer would not know rain and you are not getting getting any peshawar just grow give and then sit and meditate one boy came and you told I like to learn meditation I told you have to practice yourself with the chair so that way that is a separate time separate way we do two totally different only we dispute discuss this person ramakrishna men came and he was asking said furniture she put and Shankar Acharya she has written consider she is a beautiful broke on beyond know the master see Ramakrishna delivery the all those things but he knew all the truth of these books he is it is that tea that mind of them at first one should yes books like that and then indulge in reasoning so this is religion we go on reading so many books you can chant from so many ways and we can do so many things but actually we do not go too deep to the original thing and that is understanding the true to mention this is very simple practice is that is another nice no value within these there is something this is so precious but you do not understand that so we have to discriminate how I seeing first hearing then seeing all the changes and looking at yourself is also changing someday all these things will go away so this discrimination will put me to a place where I will never be attached with all this that is the truth that is the real process of religion Serrano Krishna is then he was singing in Bengali jatani Rida rico edori neshama mockingly chillies mine Trish's mother shamma tinder living oh my you have to keep reminding shamma means the only one names he told you have to keep the god or the Atman of the brahman or the truth within your heart and within your heart means in a thought constantly so this is the truth and all other things which are changing one should hear this in the early stages of experience referring about Musa you some of the people most of the people this to wonder how it is the siamo Krishna who has not attended in school he was not under any guidance who has not regained scripture why should you go and listen to him so he was giving indirectly and this hint to understand that those who have realized God didn't bother about eating all this because that knowledge is already within and the divine thats power and these two fellows mother is giving the supply and the beginning of this group he must have noticed those who have read the wind of past master ma shaking he was also the aiming in this day so naturally how many books one person has made that way I Syria to understand whether a person is acknowledges interesting am NOT educated person educated people will be referring different books oh that says you have EV does the wonderful go this thing that thing if you can think they will 50,000 ignoring so that means only reference you happy we don't need the whole hook the preface have to have some idea then you can say one or two words about that and then you have to tell so this is the thing unless and until you mentioned some of the names they will never accept you but really the original the truth of spirituality just bother about this this is Ramakrishna is mentioning that the first to read all here and then go deed to that a child spills out and he immediately as his own as is natural he is telling a child spills out every word as he writes but letran decides here look at it so what is religion chronic you become the said afterwards religion is realizations what is that realization you what is the truth I anything that they see is nothing bargain anxious to have the scene ball consciousness fisherman's racism moment we realize that that is the ultimate knowledge and you you don't use using you need not support from here and there near reading this region thousands of Sheila gaff teachers that their traffic authority over their study which will is active for teaching she lives out you doing that but they have not under his influence of the absolutism some that we can explain nicely but the truth of the philosophy is what only three as I always say the Creator the creation and the relation between unity that's all today morning a group of young people came or if you need money I'll here which how would you assess Exeter and she married an Indian is having sorry about the usual these are the things seawind item is very no but the true religion is this the moment you reach me that there is no problem and here a devotee described the convocation of calcutta university saying that the meeting looked like a forest of you and aids look at sri ramakrishna he was describing the invocation of the calcutta university in those days it was a very famous University and naturally all people is to go and it was a prestige for those whose to leave in that society to go and attain that to get an invitation to attend and naturally many people you went and he was describing have you noticed all shots of things people are coming and talking with ceramic ISNA and immediately he is giving him more to the spiritual way immediately he said the feeling of the divine is awakened in me when I see a great crowd of people see what and what now this person was talking about the gathering of people because of the congregation the graduation ceremonies were going on they still put on the special type of dress and all days but Saddam o Krishna is telling when so many people are there naturally the manifestation of God whether they understand or not each and every soul is nothing but the diva divine divinity all coming together small small suppose one the small this lamp is burning right now all the hundreds of that is a big light similarly for a spiritual person the moment we sees so many lamps are burning so that is a new can see in that fashion like that Moya see that's why Ramakrishna the moment you hard about this he was no forget about that you have no nothing like that he was encouraging but he was giving a new turn to this feeling of the divine is awakened in me in Saddam o Krishna when I see a great crowd of people and I seen that neatly I should have been overwhelmed with spiritual father so that is Ramakrishna and the next day was a Sunday many people are coming to meet ceramic ISNA the monied al-malik a businessman he also came so the conversation is going in that recently he has visited banaras where he owned a bungalow and serrano krishna is in credit from home so these are the special tea we always used to ask people what have you seen that that type what is the what is that all integral it's a master so you have been to Banaras did you see any holy man there he is incurring about the holy men then money large yes said I paid my respect to try lunga maha Rami and bash Quran onda vas Carranza was a very famous st. and thrilling the xiaomi you know the master tell us something about them the manila trail Unga Swami is living in the same temple where he lived before on the moniker nikka heart these are all famous names of that place near the Benny madhab minaret people say now you see people say he was formerly in a more exalted spiritual state he could perform many miracles now he has lost much of that power see the ordinary people the all is they try to find faults with like this they don't understand anything but they'll be always saying commenting something as because that Xiaomi he was in a different mode it is not necessary immediately the Saddam o Krishna is telling that is the criticism of early people the one should not live like that manila trail angusamy keeps a strict vow of silence unlike him oscar ananda is friendly with all then he is telling master did you have any conversation with the wash car ananda manila yes sir we had a long talk among other things we discussed the problem of good and evil he said to me don't follow the path of evil give up sinful thoughts that is how God wants us to act perform only those duties that are virtuous the master said yes that is also a path meant for worldly minded people but those whose spiritual consciousness has been awakened who have realized that God alone is real and all else illusory a different ideal they are aware that God alone is the doer and others are his instruments look at the difference immediately is Ramakrishna is rectifying where some people are good their morale but morality is not the ultimate is a spirituality Sosa Ramakrishna is giving that boost he is giving that immediately don't think only performing some good works will do no it is only a little but actually you have to transform yourself how by realizing that everything is nothing but God and marsh or other money Davy in a very simple language she said don't criticize others don't find fault with others whoever is doing whatever they're doing let them do appreciate because God wants that then afterwards the conversation goes on those whose spiritual consciousness has been awakened never make a false tape they do not have a reason in order to shun evil they are so full of love of God that whatever action they undertake is good action they are fully conscious that they are not the doers of their actions but Mayor servants are God when Shami be vague on the came here and he is all american disciples they were he was telling that we have to do in a group way in an organized way and I many conserved very much organized people immediately they were telling Tommy G we have to sit some day and we have to make a policy we have to make these go to that netting sharmaji to it I do not plan I only follow the models command and perform that so they it is very difficult for ordinary people but this is actually we are discussing about the people who have realized God they do not think what is going to happen now because whatever thought comes within their mind comes only after the inspiration of God otherwise not they will never do that sometimes there are some stories they're like it goes in the different books they have written the their experiences to one Shami Shami Prime ananda ji maharaj he was scheduled to go to bangladesh now bangladesh and people have come already to take everything is ready everything is fixed he only went to see ramakrishna's the temple old temple to just bow down and then people heard from below he is having the conversation he was alone but he is having the conversation he's telling Keeble Joe jevona what do you say shall I go a not he is asking Taku can you imagine only tacos picture is there still there the same picture same room and he is asking Tucker they what do you say shall I go or not you say I should not okay I want then he came down and he said I won't go because taco is not giving the permission there is no more us that everything is arranged to all programs people will be there and now you say no no i am not telling that allah is telling i won't go it's very difficult to understand so this way they were connected so every time the guidance came from God and that is why some thoughts are coming and we have to go on praying to God I am thinking in this way this is my thought they'd forget it if you are giving me this thought please help me so that I can perform it and when the things are taking shape constantly have to come and thank him because of you only all things are taking shape and that is called submission to God and when the submission comes when there is a faith God is there because of his wishes and working so that is the main thing in the bhagavad-gita when the arjuna was arguing then the sri krishna is telling my way they everything we I have already done that you see or the war is going to take shape there's nothing all are already date limit the matter above a sub bizarre gene you only become just you are doing like that because i like you i want that you get the name and fame original is a great warrior ed days that's you but everything is done already so when that type of temperament is there and we see in the life of swami vivekananda after doing such a thing a young man only single person what he did it totally changed the psyche of the whole India India which was totally segregated the length linguistically religiously culturally and so many ways and he unified the whole India in one go and then after he said I did nothing he was not at all taking any credit so that type of humbleness and ceramic is mystic telling this fully awakened souls are beyond virtue and vice they realized that it is God who does everything and here it's if they say Revere said who is giving you melkin the this story is telling I think I must read that there's a way the how he is explaining there was a monastery in a certain place the monks you know this is also the speciality of ceramic ISNA whenever he will say something immediately he will give a support to a story anecdote so the people to remember the only giving and advice there is a chance for people to forget but the moment they say something the story they in the story fully awakened soul are beyond virtual rice that is the advice and then he is telling the story there was a monastery in a certain place the monks residing there went out daily to bake their food one day monk while out for his arms sawed a landlord beating a man mercilessly the compassionate Hmong stepped in and axtell and lot to stop but the landlord was fully food filled with anger and turned his work against the innocent mom he built the Hmong till he fell unconscious on the ground someone reported the matter to the ministry the monks ran to the spot found their brother lying there four or five of them carried him back and laid him on the bed he was still unconscious other monks at around him and sad at heart some were Fanning him finally someone suggested that he should be given a little milk to drink when it was poured into his mouth he regained consciousness he opened his eyes and looked around one of the monks said let us see whether he is fully conscious and can recognize us shouting into his ear he said really odd said who is giving you milk brother replied the holy man in a low voice he who bet me is now giving me milk look at it but of course in the eye of law it will be difficult the person who is helping her barrister but here we are discussing the mentality of a spiritual person he can't see any difference a person who bet him made him unconscious he is not a person the same God he was doing that look at it and that is called knowledge and that is called love then Manila said what you have just saved applies to a man of very lofty spiritual state and then afterwards this is master was doing on asking and the people of mushy heart rakhal's birthplace had been suffering from a severe drought during the summer months Master to Manila he was a very rich man see the master the ramakrishna mission helping the poor how by going and begging and getting some help from the rich people and then giving to the poor people and who started it ceramic ISNA himself here we find he is asking that money log just now he was talking with recalled says that the people in his native village has been suffering see Syria seriously from a scarcity of water why don't you build a reserve were there that will do the people good you have so much of money what will you do with all your wealth he's asking the man to do money log of course then the master Masha is commenting Manila was a calculating man and though he he had lot of money the latter years and he set up an endowment of 25,000 rupees and for the maintenance of the post own exit etc then he also helped to get so this way inspiring the people who could afford to help the others by doing that they are also getting the blessings of God master you talk about the Prima one person has come and he is talking about the Prima and Master is telling but is it such commonplace thing there are two characteristics of prema we he was talking about the Ghana and suddenly when a person has come and talking about the devotion the prima immediately master switched over to that and he is giving there are two characteristics of prima what is that fast it makes one forget the world when you have that devotion which is called prima in that then you forget the outside world the total devotion goes to God we cannot imagine that it makes one forget the world so intense is once love of God that one becomes unconscious for other things chaitanya had these ecstatic love he took a wood for the sunday Grover brindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of Gemini oh there is for him everything is even govern so the German are and as no cleaning up minus toward the body which is so dear to man one whole one holy gets lead of the feeling that body is the soul that we see in the life of many different saint and pages also those who are practicing devotion they are following the path of devotion they are having this type of team leader by for example titanum approval of course but Niaga all so this is an excellent way there are certain signs of God realization the master is still now the man who is longing for God manifest its glories is not far from a changing slowly a person who is having those qualities manifested then people can understand that he is going to realize God sometimes some people will be talking about the holy soul he has mastered and he has realized but one has to understand by seeing his character so here we see Rama Krishna is giving what are the glories of the longing that means how we will know that he is a holy person has realized God first and foremost discrimination bichara then dispassion not at all attached for name fame etc compassion for living beings serving holi mein longing their company loving their companion chanting the name and glories of God and telling the truth these are the signs of a holy person and if these things are there in a person that means he is going to realize god that's for sure that's certain so these are the things Quinn's one that lady st. came to the Schnee sure way to be brahmani and she was when she saw see Ramakrishna immediately understood that he is not an ordinary man but in Avatara and she wanted to have a discussion with other religious people and the pundits so that she can convince them and how she convince them quoting from these because these are the characteristics it has been given in different scriptures and but ticularly devotional scriptures that these are the symbols by which you can understand a man has realized God are going to realize God and he never he always tell the truth when you see those signs of longing in an aspirant you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek a devotee sad should one fast practice discrimination to attend self control he is asking a very practical question should one fast practice discrimination now I should not do this I should not do that i should do these i should do that shall we go on doing this and then only we will go for practicing Joppa and so that we will get realization nearly duckling is asking it that is also fact the an illusion they all say in the Shankar Acharya in the BBH Romany he refers this thing that you have to discriminate fast sravana manana needed Iassogna these are the parts of the gianna yoni and the master is telling is called the path of which are reasoning Nadine ET not this not this but a brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well vision why solana business degree the inner organs are accomplished that way it is rather easily accomplished since places appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows can the all this done devotee says how can I develop love for God then the master is telling repeat his name very simple repeat his name how can I develop love for God he was talking about the love the love means that he's having tea particular things one that he forgives the old world even including his body and these two things and then he'll say repeat the name of God to cultivate the love repeat his name and seems will disappear does you will destroy last anger the desire for creature come forth and so on the devotee how can I take delight in God's name this is very important most of the people we can see the moment would you come to I don't know how many times a lot many people will come why was a active so all they will come and see they will charge and the book is there this is a little bit nothing is on but at the same time quietly sitting and taking the name of Lord for one hour how many people can do very very few so that's why unless and until we develop love for the name of God attachment for the name of God it is impossible so how can I develop love for God repeat his name how can I take delight in God's name repeating name is all I Raj unless and until I have the love for that particular name how can I take that then the master is dealing pray to God with him yearning heart that you mean take delight in his name he will certainly fulfill your heart's desire that is the only way one can do it you have to pray to god oh god please bless me so that I can love you I can take delight in EBT your name do not take away that thing from me so very simple today in this Hogan fine for us he's giving us the direction that devotion is the easiest way to reach God the dhianna Martha of course it is there but the devotion what is that the devotion love for God what is the love ramachandra is there one gentleman came and he was telling I have given my the whole house big house they are having 15 rooms to the ramakrishna mission in allahabad but now I am staying in only one room because I my wife passed away longer and one son and the daughter they don't want anything then then I told them can I give the property to the ramakrishna mission they agreed and they have given in writing also so i have given ramakrishna mission allowed me to stay in to that to house they are taking care of me in one room I am leaving but Shami me they have made once trine in the ground floor and living I am living on the first floor how can I leave on top with the Taku this video how can I leave it with this look at it is it good for me I told tackle is everywhere teeth because he is a virtue ated to live in his own room now if he comes down to be difficult and below the all the ground-floor rooms are now hospitals different doctors are coming and sitting and all now so many people whole day they will come he cannot leave over there that is good one for you but I appreciated the way he was thinking how can I so i have seen sometimes some people they will keep taco only on the floor and when you are going and standing on the floor is the same level of your feet you cannot at least some little you know that at least raised platform should be there where Taku should be there and when we are placing the photo on just on wood or stone they will place like that how can one see it now we have to change their all the chairs why because there is no cushy cushion and people sitting over there hard surface and we are sitting over here in a coup nice to feel so bad every day somehow some our devotees came forward they donated and of course you know our all things are in your pocket our credit card only with you so naturally then i told i will give you the cushions chair if you donate they donate it ever so this me only but the feeling i can God's it like this if he is not so this is called love feeling the moment that feeling has town no one you need not to get any guidance from anyone you will understand how can I stand like this and the god is sitting over there and the same level no he should be raised always high so these are the things salam o Krishna stealing and then he said he will certainly fulfill your heart so saying the master sang a song very important song in his sweet voice pleading with the Divine Mother to show her grave on suffering name and he says douche guru no amisha call to shirley li doobie morning sir ma deuce cuddle no I sang his song because today the chain is shipped including a great and today is the Tuesday and Tom said on Tuesday and Saturday McCauley is always very good mood in a very good mood if whatever you pray she will grant so always remember one taco said is must be true whatever the prayer on this two days so this is the am I am not blaming anyone mother and he says Oh mother I have no one else to blame alas I sing in the well these very hands of duck shikata Shalee late do be Marie Shama I am thinking I am dying because of my karma the gods grace will save us now up to this today and then next day again and before I conclude let me tell you that the coming saturday and sunday this weekend the for the first time we will go to attain the book fair the little quest they say of the nice by Chicago to do this is opportunity for us to go out and mix with people and dipped in the Vedanta division under our devotees in jail young groups of people because morning eight to six o'clock so i told choose

different places but if they could properly speak about the books so it would have been better now it's a first chance let us an experimental that we'll see how it goes so that is the one thing and i
