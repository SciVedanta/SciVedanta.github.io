[264: Panchama Veda 264 : Fight (Maya) From Inside a Fort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzD2Mu9HRT4)

namaskar dear devotees and friends today this wednesday evening we'll be studying the gospel of krishna the panchama veda so let us begin as usual with this verse of die seen facing utterances bring life and hope to those scorched by misery so who can truly appreciate these words of bhagavatam krishna those who have experienced the world and in the world most of the time it is the misery the suffering to when they have realized it all through the life so many things we have done but what we have got to those hearts only these words will have meaning means the speeches the teachings it's like the nectar that save us so that is the first criteria those who have realized the futility of this worldly life for them this is so they are extrolled by the wise sages and the mayor listening to them should bestow auspiciousness on all they confer very prosperity those whose spread them broadcast are verily magnanimous they distribute what is completely satisfying to the hearers so this is how the they are explaining the bhagavad-gita teaching that in his hinduism there are many gods and goddesses in reality there is only one god but before we go to that the today is the the page that we are going to read 660 the page number 660 of the gospel of sri ramakrishna by she we find that sirama krishna is talking about in one page about the faith then he says about one god though appears in so many different gods and goddesses then third he talk about the love of god how we will understand a person has developed love for god and fourth fight from within a fort that for the householders he is encouraging so we will read and then try to understand how he is telling then finally the fifth we find either it continue continuing this the gospel that we are reading the qatar originally in bengali how the lord himself is inquiring from the recorder more three more the master mahashiya than binder not gupta he is recording all this but three the master masha is recording krishna sometimes he's asking tell me what i say like that we will read to that too so that gives the authenticity of this wonderful book the pure authenticity because many of the books spiritual books are they that is recorded much afterwards the lord buddha passed away almost 100 years after they had a meeting then slowly slowly the repeat occur they that came after that after a long time not immediately after the lord and there were of course two three people were there they were telling like this and that so to repeat occur about the bible also they could not note down immediately they memorized and from their memory only they wrote so four bibles so that is the way but the gospel of sirama krishna when the lord was leaving and talking that was at that time it was recorded and sudama krishna himself the lord himself was inquiring about the it should not be the written in such a way that his idea is not properly expressed that is the wonderful thing in prada gospel the authenticity is there anything that is impossible for faith that i am starting with this page 660 is there anything that is impossible for faith he has already discussed about the faith faith in the existence of god in sanskrit this called astik kabuti astika means accepting the existence of god and another they say the existence and the faith in the words of the veda darshan nasty darshan means we are accepting the veda as true whatever it is recorded and some they are not accepting so gnastic here the accepting the faith means accepting what the existence of god and what is this god many people they ask how to realize god what is this god so this is the confusion is always there oh what will happen to me i have not realized god yet i like to realize god is it like something somewhere hidden that we will go and search and find out it's not like that the god means the all purity and purity means all love and how it is possible to discover to get when we completely withdraw the mind from these worldly objects bishaya bishabatyarja in the many places they always say it should be discarded as we discard the venom the poison when we are discarding the poison the like that we have to discard the bishaya it should be discarded and when we are discarding where we will keep the mind will keep the mind on the positive idea and that is the consciousness which manifests as love that's why l-o-v-e swami vivekananda said is god and that love how that love will be expressed on selfishness the love and unselfishness together we can say is that god when one is developing that the love without any boundary the love that can embrace each and everything without discriminating the caste creed color language religion nothing the sakes nothing all love so that embracing is called the religious love tomorrow is the 24th december and the they say of course a lot of controversies are there so when exactly jesus were born but they have taken it as a 24 december because the jewish people that is and also the christianity side by side 24 december is a great day for the jewish the afterwards those who broke from the that they decided 24 december should be accepted as the birthday of the jesus in those days there is no record sir the birthday of jesus the 2 000 years people are worshiping the lord jesus he was not a king he was not a scholar he was not a rich person then why people are loving him respecting him because he had the tremendous love for the humanity because he was completely unselfish these two qualities we find in him so tomorrow at 6 30 from the vedanta society the live stream and the very humble very simple way we'll be celebrating this great soul the christianity is different it is the process and all those things we are not that way that appreciating the christianity as such but we accept jesus without hesitation bhagavan sirama krishna himself also he saw the jesus that the mary the mother mary and on her lap the child jesus sudama krishna saw the light coming and sudama krishna realized the jesus sudama krishna saw the jesus in person coming and mixing in his person so that suramar krsna's song and that all those so this is the lord jesus we have faith that is god why love and unselfishness so what is god to develop love and unselfishness and these two things are already there within us so what is the faith faith that i have the capacity to manifest that divinity that is already within me that is the faith and what is god those two qualities which are there already been with us we love but we love only our kit and cain and very small group of people and when that love goes beyond all boundaries that is called spiritual love that is spirituality when that unselfishness manifests within us oh this is my brother so i should love him and that is not so i am not not like that the unselfishness means no desire for anything so that to when we have then that is the faith and the faith is i am that purity i am that which is known as god this three-letter word god means this quality and i am having that i'm going to manifest that and if we don't have the faith then we cannot do anything that's why bhagavan sirama krishna he denounced in many places in the gospel we have already read and we will be reading in other afterwards in the pages that he is telling again and again why do you talk about the weaknesses that may be their weaknesses maybe that i did something wrong now and realize that that is wrong now i realize that time i didn't it is a mistake so i say i am sorry and i take the oath that i am not going to repeat those things now the new year is coming we are going to celebrate the fast year the first day of the year 2021 and all people will be celebrating with the food and many other things but that is the time one should go back to his all record what have i done so these are the things i have committed these are good things these are bad thing now i should take the oath the bow a promise to myself i am taking the promise to myself committing the promise that i will try to do all good things the good thoughts good activities and i make the promises and i those will be my goal in 2021 these are the things i'm going to do so that is the way slowly slowly we become purified we will draw our mind from all the saints objects and we purify and that faith should be there faith in the existence of god the god means that purity and purity means love and unselfishness and who is going to achieve that me from where it is already within me only thing i have to manifest that in many millions fold that's all so that is where it says a true devotee has faith in everything now he is telling that krishna that true devotees are everything what is that everything he meant formless reality god with form and rama krishna whatever dhaba tara that come formless reality what is the formless reality consciousness it is not having any form all pervading the sanadana dharma from the beginning when it began we do not know but the sanadana dharma the eternal religion means the complete faith in the existence of this consciousness which is all-pervading and which is one so that is the way sadama krishna is giving the teaching and he says in this way a true devotee has faith in everything then he said the formless reality god with form then rama krishna and the divine mother the tree formless reality is consciousness chaitanya in bengali many a times he said hey that means the jagged this world it is saturated in consciousness and nothing but consciousness everything is that consciousness everything right this moment we cannot see this wood is that also conscious of course it is but the manifestation is so less we cannot see this that scientists chandra bosu the heat proved that the plants the trees are also having the life if you are going and beating the plants every day whenever they see the plants see the man is coming with the stick they start throbbing that's a fear but they but expression is so less we don't that is not affecting us sometimes some people who they talk about that we should not kill the for the meat the animals and all that but we should go and plug the vegetables do they understand that that is also the same way they are also afraid they don't like to die so that is also proved but as because the manifestation is very less it is not affecting us and when we are sacrificing some uh the animals we can understand we can see it is so palpable that they are suffering that affects us do we say no to that there is a different question whether you like it or not but the truth is this the consciousness is present everywhere the consciousness is present everywhere that is why the hindus the sanatana panties when they used to go to dig a place for construction of the house they will be doing the bhumi puja what is the bhumi puja they'll be worshipping that particular place the bhumi the land where they're going to construct the building almost all the two foundations stone laying that puja hindus they always do puja now what is this puja they'll be going accepting that that particular place where we are going to d naturally the earth it will be heart and there will be so many other small insects are there we are going to kill them harm them so we go and pray to them please forgive us but it is necessary so for us to do so we are doing so this is the way we have to understand everything is nothing but the consciousness but manifestation are different and it is most manifested in the human being and that too very sensible in a religious person a holy person a spiritual person because that mind become broad like the sky and he can feel everything xiaomi vivekananda those who have gone through the biography of swami vivekananda you all know the shami vivekananda is writing or telling to his the brother disciple my mind i don't know whether i have realized god or not but my mind has become so broad i can embrace everything even eve there is something like the saitan the devil i think i can also stay with him i can forgive i can adjust that broadness and that is called god realization understanding that truth is called realization and second is god with form but as because this is very difficult for many of us to realize god or to conceive god and to understand god without form so hindus are allowed to think about your god or goddess you think god like this no problem you think god like that no problem so that is why they all are hindu but one a group of people they will be worshipping god is durga if you go to bengal the great celebration durga puja again another group of hindus they are also hindus if you go to maharashtra the huge the ganesh ganesha puja so it in different places but all are hindus the bengal is when they are going to the maharashtra they are also dancing and singing and praying to the ganesha the maharashtrians when they are going to bengal they are also praying to goddess durga and all we accept everyone but we choose one particular god or god is whom we like that is called ishta devata or easter means those who are going to give me the blessings and it is my choice if we don't understand these then we will confuse about the hinduism the hinduism is this it is formless and is everywhere at the same time it may be with form and many so that is according to your condition you are progressing slowly so this and it says abu tara in the human form the rama the krishna they're all in the human form they have come the divine mother the divine mother has come in different form bhagavan si rama the great soul full of love sympathy can't we tell them the god then whom shall we call god so this conception should be very clear and when that is there the faith will come and with that faith we can do anything so that is called savage rama krishna is telling the faith then he is giving an example very funny way once while i was going to kamarpukur kamapukul the birthplace of krishna i was overtaken by a storm i was in the middle of a big meadow the place was haunted by robbers i began to repeat the names of all the deities rama krishna and bhagavati i also repeated the name of hanuman hanuman is a powerful god so to have to save myself who is going to save me so he is going on i chanted the name of them all what does that mean now he's explaining what does it mean why not one god does is it means that i don't believe in particular god i do but at the same time i believe that all these forms names and forms of gods and goddesses they are the same so what does it mean let me tell you again he is giving another example while a servant is counting out the money to purchase supplies he says these penis are for potatoes of course nowadays the penny can't purchase anything there's no value but that is the penny in those days it was great value for the potatoes these are the pennies and those are for the eggplants and these for fish he counts the money separately but after the list is completed he puts the coins together so this is so clear this is so simple then when we are counting when we are praying to what the particular god then we go to another god but all god and goddesses are the same consciousness ultimately but i like to pray to srama krishna i like to pray to maha sharadamani devi because i like them that is my choice you suppose like to pray to sharashvati or to lakshmi or to kali or to ganesha or to hanumana or to sheba there are hundreds and thousands of gods and goddesses and you can create your own god and goddess there is also no problem but we all know they all are coming from the same one consciousness and that is the uniqueness in the hinduism so it is all combined anyone who is coming lord buddha came he rebelled against the hinduism because some of the the hindus the practices particularly on those times he was not favoring those things so he rebelled swami vivekananda said is the rebuilt child of hinduism the rebel child of hinduism he objected those things not the complete veda or the philosophy but some of the things like the young girls and all that you know the old system slowly slowly accumulate many bad things bad habits so he was as a sort of uh the changing the things but anyway afterwards his followers they made it as separate it's okay so this is buddhism and their philosophy they developed and afterwards so different type of philosophies but that is a different thing christianity it is a judaism he was a jewish christ and he was in that community and he objected to some of the ways they were explaining the religion he objected to those then afterwards his followers is a separate so this is the way they all separating it's okay but when we go to god the ultimate what it is love and unselfishness and if it is not the love and unselfishness the love that embraces the each and every one with all varieties with all the shortfalls it is not divine love it cannot be so that everything encompassing enveloping the whole thing that is called the divine love and then also the unselfishness because i don't have anything the hidden agenda i go and do like these and then there's all political people that do because they like to grab the power that is natural politics means grabbing the power but spirituality is completely different giving up all this so that's why politics and spirituality cannot go hand in hand it is not possible our the spirituality always go to the conscience of the people and really politics is different so then that is the thing we have to understand that what is spirituality this spirituality is this fast is the faith faith is the existence of god and god that is nothing but the whole love and unselfishness and when you find that love and selfishness manifesting in one person we call him avatar we call him god even the little thing we call maha purusha the great soul so that is that we have to understand and what is this god is one the second he is telling he counts the money separately but after the list he completed he puts the coin together the god is one when one develops love of god one likes to talk only of god now how i will know that i have got the faith in the existence of god and that i have developed love for the god because my likings if i don't like that particular ideology the the philosophy or the concept then naturally i won't be able to practice that i will never do that so naturally thought comes the faith in love the love in love god the faith and the love love for god this is telling it is love for god how you know the man has developed a love for god then sudama krishna is giving the sign that he will talk only about god only about the high spiritual values only about the morality only about the love and services that is the way one can express that he is truly loving god so this we have to understand when one develops love of god one likes to talk only of god but this is the way we have to understand a holy person only of god maybe he is mentioning these and that because living in the society means many different things are happening so it if you go through the pages of the biography of bhagavatam krishna all these gospel of sadama krishna we find he is talking about so many things why this is happening what is that who came about everything he is inquiring why is a the god and also he's a devotee of god you should be only talking about god no other way to understand in a very practical way as a person living in the society and whatever happening all around the society the people will talk about that and that is the way sometimes we talk about the social changes sometimes political changes economical changes other changes do we talk about that too and at this moment the pandemic 19 that kovite 19 is going on all over so people are talking about that the monks are also talking about because that is affecting each and every one but the major portion of his mind his love for giving a talk is only on god and nothing else when a monk as a person that the devotee is a lover of god wherever he goes or she goes they'll be talking here how are you and what are the things about all those then we'll go back to the god and he'll talk about god and then all those talks will be about the services about the love about the sacrifices all about god so this is the way we have to understand suramar krishna now addressed muhimacharan who was a householder this householder means he was a married person he was having the family so the householder it doesn't mean that a householder won't be able to do anything sometimes some people used to come to bhagavan's ramakrishna used to tell oh my god he's so close to she's so obsessed with the worldly objects and always trying to grab those things is obsessed and according to sirama krishna one should not have the company of those people but the husband and wife taking care of the family the children their relatives their friends nothing wrong in it that is natural that is normal and sadama krishna is will be giving the the teaching for them you can have that you should fight from within the fourth that you will come to that now but why he is mentioning because this person mahima charan who was a householder master marshall wrote to introduce mahmacharan why he always talked about the vedanta and he'll be reading all books and talking about the vedanta that there is no other thing but the consciousness the brahman the atman will be he'll be talking but at the same time he has a responsibility as a householder he has his wife his children his property and other businesses so that that is the reason this man don't talk about this but in reality he cannot follow those teachings so master master introduced that he is a householder master sadama krishna what need is there of renouncing the world all together sirama krishna the great renouncer ma yogi but now when he is talking with this person who says something and does something this hypocrisy is not at all good so one should not say something and then he can't practice that but that won't help him people after listening to those words they will be considered oh this is a great soul look at him but you know that you can't do that so don't be a hypocrite that is exactly what suramar krishna is telling he was he used to talk and we have already heard the mahima charan he always talk about the high vedanta and that is not for him he is not in that condition that is for completely different type of people so not that vedanta ultimate vedanta advaitha is not true that is true but at the same time some people who are not ready to follow that for them other things are there so he says like this he says what need is there of renouncing the world all together we don't talk about that some people are renouncing bhagavan sirama krishna he is helping a person and for that he is not breaking the condition because if you are not capable of understanding science and if you admit yourself in a course in the science what will happen you will suffer unnecessarily you will never get good marks and that don't won't help you in future life why on you have to study science there are so many other subjects are there and if you are good in some other subjects it is better to choose that and be successful in that that is the thing here the vedanta is there a vedanta and renouncing everything that is for swami vivekananda brahmananda that is for some joyous people a group of people who can really do it though swami brahman and the rakhal maraji was married even then sudama krishna understood that you'll be able to do it and he helped him to renounce the world and but for the mohimacharan what the master masha is not doing that is called the great teacher he understands the what is there in the mind of the student and accordingly he guide so here he's telling to mahima charan what need is there of renouncing the world altogether it is enough if you can read yourself of attachment this is the word that we should mark even if we are there in the world as a householder and doing all the duties that a householder is supposed to do attending all those responsibilities but on attached way then he becomes sannyasi you know you should consider him as the true sannyasi who is not attached to anything and not also averts to anything whatever comes is okay it doesn't matter to him people are criticizing or praising he knows there is nothing it's just like in the air so many now the tremendous wind is going on in chicago and we see all the dead leaves are all flying here there is it contaminating the air no but this moment these all slips are there but the air will flow somewhere it is very good it goes in its own way is not affected by anything that goes for some time with it so that is the under we have to understand if we are not attached to the objects then i am free whether i live in the householder's life or amongst life that is very important if you can read yourself of attachment but you must have sadhana you have to fight the saints organs but to give up the attachment for the saints objects means you have to practice a lot sadhana that he said like that then he says it is a great advantage to fight from inside a fort it's a great advantage to fight from inside a fort what is that fort family and if you are a monk and if you are living under a tree then you have to go somewhere in the night time or in the rainy season or in the winter time to take shelter and in india in different places the rich people they make some rooms called dharmashala that means the people can go and stay over there you need not to pay anything and who were those people these monks wandering monks and when you think of that we are you know there's an adventure we are walking through this path going to that village adventurous life i don't know where i'm going it is okay but what is the purpose god realization it is not the tourism i go from here to there there to there and every time i am traveling in india if you are wearing a gerua cloth and having the beard if you are a sannyasi even if you don't purchase the ticket in the train they will allow you the great respect for the monks that is the national that psychology so they allow them and if you go and stand before somebody's house you will get the food if you go to temple you will have some place to lie on so that is not the thing why are you roaming around and begging is that the purpose then is completely different a vegan life but if the purpose is god realization in that case is it not better to stay in one place and make a nice routine and no disturbances and not that much of the physical tiredness and mental tiredness be worrying about the food about the clothing about the medicine about the place to stay nothing you need not to worry about anything isn't that good so stealing about that the monks life are completely different but those who like to realize god and still they are in the household should not break their mind oh what has happened to us why i cannot realize god why i am so sorry that i married no not like that nothing this is rama krishna he is embracing each and every one and giving them the blessings that each and every one can realize god friends this first january is approaching the 1886 first january sirama krishna at exactly at 3 10 sometimes they say 3 8. that he manifested his divinity in the human form the divine how blessings each and everyone whoever came whoever came he blessed them and that is why they call it kalpataru wish fulfilling tree the devotees have so many desires wishes prayers so they came and they touched the feet of sudama krishna they did not to pray for that immediately the thought whatever they were having that was fulfilled so that is called the wish fulfilling tree kalpatur we are going to celebrate and this time 2021 will be in the morning from 10 30 to 12 32 hours the four very senior swami of the ramakrishna order they will be speaking and two very good singers from our france center grade center they will be singing so if you like you can join if you go to our website you will find that you can join there so this is a wonderful way again on the first at three o'clock we will have the prayer session three to three thirty that will be all also in the life so sirama krishna is telling this is a great advantage after enjoying different things you should give them up one by one after enjoying then you should give them up one by one at the time he's talking about the householder not about the sannyasins on the first january he blessed only the householders not the sannyasins for them it is totally different they are totally different psychology mentality attitude and their discipline is different but for the householders we need not to give up the whole world in this life we won't be able to realize god no it is possible only whatever you are doing perform it do it properly and get unattached to that and when you are giving up you give one after another a little little slowly slowly one step then next step step by step proceed to that and that is the same goal the same place and sudama krishna giving the example after enjoying different things you should give them up one by one once i has a desire to put a gold chain around my waist and there were rich people they used to have that in the the india was full of gold at time when sudama krishna is talking about that damn india already became very poor because so many people plunderers came from outside and they plundered there's so much wealth from india and took it out but that is history but even then the rich people now also if you go at the time of marriages the all these ladies will be so much so much of gold and all that they like it saw it and he's he told his the disciple mathur babu i like to put that and around i obtained one at last and put it on but i had to take it off immediately why because his mind was not accepting that that is a sannyasi mind all the decorative thing and the costly thing and it is not in that mind his thought is completely different he thinks completely different way but the householders suppose they are having those that jewelries and no problem there some people i have seen that some people are having two two rings in one one finger and they're having i don't know the the four or five fingers all in two that means ten rings let them have some time then afterwards slowly slowly they can go on removing and say enough i put on all those things and now it is enough the costly watches they put on and afterwards they give it to the younger people no you can take so this way one by one enjoy and then give up and never think of that again that is also possible and that is the way we can have now a musician will be coming and he will be performing and the few pages next few pages next day we will study that and where sirama krishna is talking about how everything that he spoke he corrected for the recorder for the master master so okay friends i think one or two questions are there so let us talk to that so the first question is from santa banerjee the question is how we should overcome miseries when we are hurt by the worldly people here the very practical questions on ita very practical and yeah truly it hurts the mind that's true but you know that if we are going on pondering over that thinking again and again then it will go much pain much more pain and if we go to tell people other people they will sometimes they will show outwardly sympathy but afterwards they themselves will go on discussing about that that is also not good so what to do whatever has happened happened only people the cruel type of people whatever they have done done but now if we go to god and pray god i can't bear these things it really pains me can you please do something and please give some good idea in their mind about me let them be friends if not at least take me away from them from their companion i believe if you pray like this and try to forget that with the prayer a tearful eyes with the if you pray your mind will be very calm and then if you can overcome that then you can say okay let them do what they do i am not affected by that so that is another higher condition of the mind so if you can do that in the beginning you can go and pray to god instead of going to other people for sympathy which is very rare to get better go to god alone pray to god in the tearful eyes and god will save you and you will find a situation will develop believe me a situation will develop just because of your prayer sincere prayer and god will help in that way those people either they will be friendly with you appreciate you or they will go somewhere else they won't disturb you the next question is from ashutosh chaudhary he's asking how do we balance work comma family and spiritual life this is also a very practical question ashutosh babu and ashutosh means sheba and the shiva balanced everything so now i'm just kidding so this is how you can do it first is your duty and your family and spiritual life what is spiritual life just now i was reading spiritual life nothing but detachment so when you are attending the family the responsibilities if you do all those things and then you tell to god god you have kept me in this family now i am enacting i'm having this particular position of a father or a husband or a brother or a son so i'm whatever i have to do responsibility you have given me i am doing but please don't leave my hand please don't leave my hand so this is the way if you go on praying within yourself and this problem will be over spirituality is nothing but thought of god and worldliness a thought of the worldly objects now we are in between we have come to know that we have to be spiritual but most of us we are in the worldly life then what to do understanding that this is the situation from here we have to go out and we can go out utilizing all this the work as a in in the offices and also responsibility in the family and the society and the only way detached way whatever you do whatever you think mentally you need not to show it before others mentally you give it to god every time god i give it to you and please make me free of all this by this way you will be successful the next question is from srima vishwas she's asking being a householder in bad times cannot control my wife bad time means some difficult times in the uh situation the control that that is that you know the bhagavatam krishna is telling practice detachment but then the next sentence he said you have to practice tapasha the taposa means practicing again and again and again then suppose i say that i am not going to fight with anyone not going to think any bad thoughts any wrong thoughts that should not cross my mind but suppose it goes suddenly some bad thoughts come and i behave badly with some people again i will go to god and say i am sorry i will try again and if we are going on trying to that is the advice of the lord krishna to arjuna obviously practice practice practice if we go on as i am telling again and again if we go on pondering over that thinking over that again and again brooding over that who is going to suffer i because that thought is pinching me so give it to god and tell him this is the situation i can't control my anger and i go and fight i shout i tell some bad words which i am not supposed to so please help me and give me the strength in my mind you will get the strength and your realization your understanding your behavior will be far better matured and very peaceful and the people will wonder how he can do like that or how she can do like this because god's power will be within you how through prayer sincere prayer thank you thank you very much friends thank you for attending this class and if any benefit out of this reading that it's a blessings of bhagavatam krishna so let us say shanti shanti shanti three times and pray for the peace peace from the nature from the neighbors all around the people and the animals and other things and also from my mind and body o shanti foreign
