[37: Panchama Veda 37: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppRS6iX1z1I)

let us begin foreign he was response giving the reply to srima's question master masters some questions last time we were hearing that in response to srima's very wonderful questions srama krishna said last and greed alone is the obstacles to yoga god realization we can say the god realization only two things kama is telling two things you must know these are the obstacles for god realization but we go to so many details but we do not care about these two which are very very important for spiritual progress kama asia krodha this is the desire and when the desire is not fulfilled the anger these are the two things bhagavan si rama krishna said last and greed almost same thing he is telling karma the last desire and at the same time is going on demanding craving like that so this is the karma and krodha if these two are there then one cannot realize god about the food about the clothing about the circumstances about the language it is nothing but people will be giving so much of stress on all those things for getting this two important thing that's why we find that spiritual progress is stagnated they are practicing religion they are very sins here but their spiritual progress is very very stagnated i have given the name this kathamrita as panchama veda this is really veda and then veda only speaking about some ideology here siram krishna is giving his example his own personal example his life that is more important sis and then he said perform your duties in an unselfish spirit this is also a very unique thing master mashay was asking whether one should do work because that conception that the moment you are doing the work you are getting the result so don't do any work that was the wrong conception you cannot stop like that you are going on doing some work and all that work that you are doing that is also creating some result why not you do all sorts of work but knowing that how to do it the cigarette of work that is what see ramakrishna is telling so practical the majority of the people they misunderstood when in the bhagavad-gita to explain the bhagavad-gita the shankaracharya is telling the karma that work binds what type of karma he mainly made the yaga and yankya all the sacrifices it became so important in that time so they were protesting they were guiding the people that is not the main thing bhagavan buddha also telling his dad his followers perhaps misunderstood and of course others against whom he was fighting they also misunderstood so this is the problem when they are giving a teaching people are not understanding it properly bhagavan sri ramakrishna is very in very simple language he is telling that do every sort of duties but in an unselfish spirit this is the important in the present-day world if we are not working or doing we cannot survive each and every one is working and different situation they are working it doesn't matter at all when you were working work then he was asking what type of perform your duties without desiring any result that's also sirama krishna is explaining perform your duties work and duties sometimes we do some work which are not our duties not our responsibilities but we do but there are some duties responsibilities blindness is they are bound to do even in that perform your duties without desiring any result unselfish spirit then he explained without any result then master masha raised the question of secular and sacred whenever a person is performing puja whatever he is doing inside the temple and that is considered as very holy of course that is holy no doubt but that is not the holy thing that's why about swami vivekananda margaret noble sister nibedita when she was writing she has mentioned a very beautiful sentence about swami vivek he is writing that sentence in him all were equal secular and sacred secular means these worldly things and sacred means something special something holy even today major of the people who claim that they are practicing religion go to them for them only those things are very very holy and they are practicing they are in the society but at the same time they will be telling no we do not look at the ladies so you go through something else somebody else and who has given the birth who has raised you and they are thinking that is a practice of course they can do but at that time they should be in seclusion but when you are in the society you cannot insult people like that when some people are coming and offering the food they say no no i cannot touch your food but give me the raw items i will cook it what type of things is it not hypocrisy so this we have to understand very clearly those who are really trying to practice they must be bhagavan siram krishna started his life on that he was not accepting even the prasad of goddess kali he was taking the raw the cha rice and all this and then cooking himself then slowly slowly he raised to that height and he said so that is the spirituality that is the religion and here he is telling about when the master moshe was asking secular and secret work what type of work one should do his clear reply was without exception all type of work without exception perform work there is no way of renouncing work all together so do your work but again he is giving that surrender the result to god this is a very simple way but very perfect way most perfect way if you are surrendering the work what will come humbleness simplicity and that gives the purity and moment you are pure you are surely going to realize god no doubt so that's why one should be very very cautious about not the work but how he is performing it he is within the mind there is any desire and desire comes in so many different ways it's so difficult to understand the mind is constantly deviating us our mind because the prakriti because the sudama krishna will explain afterwards to sri mom the shame same shakti the same power of god is binding and at the same time giving mukti it's binding and putting in the will of birth and death and all sort of shots of pain misery and at the same time giving just like the little light flashing light some type of joy and to get the joy they go on go on go on rotating suffering suffering suffering and at the same time seems force if you can please that force gives mukti we will get that and here he is telling in bhagavad-gita same suramar krishna as krishna mentioning look at it yatu karushi whatever you do and then ashnasi whatever you eat you take jehoshi whatever you are offering even the charity that you are doing yeah this is also very important when a person is doing the job meditation puja he's doing the tapasya or fasting for god taking his name singing his name is glory but that he thinks that i should give this is my merit as much as it comes is good and if you purchase the ticket in the same airline they will be giving you some merit some plot and then if you can get so many thousand of that number then you may get a free ticket from here to saintly that's right and for that we are going on purchasing the same airline again and again then i do not know when we are going to complete that number to century and so what is there so this is the way always we are tempted always purchase one get two all people are after that because we always want to get something free and this is the reason we are always hankering after this free thing when you are going to the god it is creating problem but suramar krishna he is telling give everything to god work on a test we is an excellent training excellent training his disciple his son swami brahmanandaji he is explaining it more simple way he is telling when you are going to your office to a place of work just before starting the work remember god just then in between when there is a tea break coffee break or lunch break again take out the picture from your wallet look at the god and pray to him a little and again finally when you are close closing your work from your duty or coming out remember him and say this is what i offer to you good bad i don't know i'm giving it to you you have to karoshi you're the asanasi the moment you are going to eat anything just remember god you are within me i am offering it to you brahma panam brahma that we always chant that is that only we only two myself and bharadananda will be chanting all devotees some will be looking at some will be wondering some will be chatting among themselves and not bothering about it and those who are chanting also don't know the meaning of it what they are doing this is the thing we have to understand no each and everyone should understand i appreciated i liked i brought that ah many other centers our vidanta societies they keep the papers in the hands of the devotees of course i have seen that very small group of devotees so it is easy hours is big number of people come but still i am thinking that we will be distributing and there is a prayer after that chanting brahmaganam then they will explain the meaning of it then they will pray to god in english it is there with me i am thinking that i should ask our devotees also to do that so that it will have some meaning that is important and offering uh your sacrifices of yourselves whatever we are doing that the young that also and the dharsaja when you are offering something to a poor person helping someone like your people are coming and donating before the societies the temple is going to give to god oh god please accept it i was just remembering a one incident that happened in the life of one of our stronger listeners to the vice president one person was very rich but he was not accepted by all in the society because his way of earning was not good he became rich and somehow he wanted to serve the swami we didn't disclose anything to the swami and this was totally a person who was totally new to him he never knew anything about him and when he brought a very new car just from that showroom and here swamiji you must come to this car he was not ready to he was refusing no no it is all right i will go to that car another car came a small car very old but still he was liking that no no i will go to that car somehow everyone floats so he sat over there the moment the gentleman started the car maybe a second or so the one a wheel burst and it stopped over there the new car how it happened the gentleman himself was driving he got down but he was not able to change the wheel so he was asking some some others help some drivers etc in the meantime the swamiji got down usually whatever happens he is quietly sitting he never moves until he is asked to but this time he opened the door got down and started walking then he found that person who was the first person who came to receive him he was there is the humble hey you are the person now you came to receive me where is your car swamiji little guy can walk no problem go quickly and he almost very fast he walked saturn i also ran because i was in charge i should be with him he's the shebac the swami who was looking after him he was going on telling how how that man will feel it is nothing but only two three minutes it will take to repair the it will change then they will we can go that's a very good car uh jerking will be less air condition is good then he said you go but i'm going to in this car he never used that car how he could i don't know of course i didn't disclose anything to anyone that time and when he reached the astra next day all the devotees they brought some food and a lady also brought food from that house and in the beautifully in a decorated way they gave the food so many items in a big thala the plate they brought it was there before the swami he took from everyone's little little from the spoon without touching that one without knowing who ascended then the shevak again told swamiji take from here a little he said no my i'm done i'm finished so i won't take it then when he was this is this has come from his family how can i say that you have not taken he said you take you like it you take you like to satisfy him you take i'm not going to take how even if you want to serve it's very difficult god don't receive it the gentleman the businessman who came to see ramakrishna wanted to offer 10 000 rupees he didn't accept it but he was requesting the master washer to bring two dhotis to cloths this is the wonder we do not understand but whose services god is accepting know it for sure he is blessed and that's why he should be very very humble blessed that those who have been chosen for his work in one place swamiji is telling think yourself blessed because you have been chosen to work for god don't complain whatever is possible go on doing and you will be blessed sure so this is what is telling ya yes this is the golden rule to get peace that we have to remember then on the basis of this on the basis of this mainly swami vivekananda has created this monastic organization it was totally absent the buddhist used to do it the christians is to do it services to the society to some extent but hindus never this time swamiji introduced till now the hindus do not understand till now they will be criticizing not understanding this is the true religion here we find that master moshe he is asking another question how long one should do one's duty and so that i can re renounce the world i can take sannyasa and can go but surama krishna is replying as you advance near and nearer to god he will reduce your activities little by little have no fear so you need not to bother about that but if you are really sincere then only it will be reduced one of our swamis i was asking him that you have worked very hard do you like to go on a vacation then he said swamiji only one thing i want i like to die quickly and to go away from this world and to go to sirama krishna see what type of desire because constantly he is thinking that i want to merge with god but he is very sincere in his duties to perform his work whatever he will take up you will do it perfectly but in the meantime he is constantly praying to god please reduce my all duties and take me to you that is the way one should practice sadhana just because i am not liking this world the life is difficult over here so i give it up and then i go you cannot continue the religious life is very very difficult then what he will do he will cheat others and he himself will suffer and make others also suffer so this is the reason the katamrita the gospel is so important we are so eager to read the veda and majority of the people do not understand what is there in the veda and they will be simply telling oh i have read veda i have read these i have read that one gentleman was giving order over telephone to two upanishads he could not pronounce the name of the supernations he was failing and then but he is interested to read those upon upanishads what you will understand very little but if you read only the gospel of sadama krishna in a very simple manner the truest thing the best thing the secret of success in spiritual life it is there very few few people will understand it most of the people who are in so called other groups they don't bother about reading the gospel of sunama krishna it's a mistake that this is the knowledge it's not only for men for the disciples of sudama krishna it's everyone so what he says you need not to give away the work only do it in such a way so that it is not binding you how give it to god perform it perfectly and every day mentally offer it to god and then you are really sincere for sannyasa perform your duty perfectly just by giving away the duties on do but at the same time within your mind go on praying oh god i want to be with you constantly he will reduce your duties responsibilities and your mental temperament will be such that you will feel joy in repeating the name of god now master musha asked a very tricky question three questions he is asking is the meaning of realization of god in bengali what is the meaning of realization of god second ishar darshan what do you mean by god vision kamun kuri ishad darshan hoy how does one attend it see this very important questions how does one attain god realization and what is god realization what do you mean by vision of god many people will be telling swamiji almost every day i see goddess kali and then what i don't know what i should do with goddess kali and then you ask ali why you are asking me kali didn't come to me to tell this you asked god is kali he is imagining or she is imagining god is called the moment you see the goddess curry whole personality will transform transform it's not ordinary vision and we see right we see these we see that but look at the life it is not changing there is no love there is no purity there is hankering for everything and then at the same time demanding i have these have that i was reading a book and they are telling within seven days nirvikalpa samadhi within seven days what type of need because i don't know but it's good that if if they can't teach a person to sleep properly there's nothing wrong but this way people deviating others cheating others it's not true sudama krishna is very clear now when he is asking this question this master mashay it reminded me of the great conversation between that in the upanishad it is there the great conversation between jagger and gargi one king announced that i have few thousands cows in those days that was the wealth but i will give it only to him who will declare that he is the brahma-gyani he has realized brahman all the assembled but who will claim that i am the brahmagani no one can claim in that way because the moment you are claiming that you are a brahmagyani that means there is something wrong all are sitting and thinking what to do and suddenly yagya balka a very famous saint he came there and he was shouting to his disciple hey take those cows to my asthma you know all others we are sitting over here for a long time do you think you are a brahmagyani yagawaka said i offer my pranam to the brahman ghani but i need this cows for my asthma so i am taking you cannot take like that you have to argue with us and then gargi that lady saint now in our country some of the rigid people so-called orthodox people they are telling the ladies should not read the veda ladies should not be forefront in the spirituality so wrong this gargi maikri all who are they and gargi she she is arguing with whom young all others were afraid even to ask a single question he was such a great personality then gargi started arguing that wonderful question and answer then gargi understood that it is impossible to defeat him then she asked a very tricky question what is brahman yat daval understood no one can explain what is brahman it is subjective knowledge he understood that to answer this question he must have to say i do not know and then gargi will say see he does not know how can he take all the cows yagavalga then he said gargi knowing well that no one can answer what is brahman you are asking this question this is very wrong you want to defeat me defeat in a proper way or you are insulting me but then he said i am giving you the caution if you are playing this trick just to insult me before everyone just to defeat me before everyone your head will burst then jaggi sat down offered har pranam accepted the defeat so that was the conversation because the question was what is brahman now master moshe asking the same question is what do you mean by god vision god realization how it is possible and how siram krishna is giving the answer he is not giving the caution rather he is explaining with the help of the vaisnava philosophy swami vivekananda said one person was standing on the earth and he was looking at the sun he is seeing the sun and he is explaining sun is like this it's just this maybe that two feet by two feet is a round thing he is correct and then a person who is traveling in an aeroplane may be 35 000 feet high he also looks at the sun he explains it in his way he's also correct and the another one who travels in a rocket goes nearer to sun goes out in from the orbit of the earth looks at the sun his explanation is also correct but all will be different why because all are looking at the sun experiencing sun but the experiences is having different degree all are correct but degree of experience is different look at it very scientific way he is telling similarly sirama krishna taking the help of the vaishnava philosophy is telling there are pravartaka sadhaka siddha and siddha paravartaka means just set food on the path of god he he came to the temple offered pranam one young boy american boy he comes and says i like to be a yogi aren't you well you're welcome to be a yogi what i have to do i told first few days you just come offer pranam to taco and try to sit over there for 10-15 minutes as long as you feel peace sitting over there i found him coming but he sits only for two minutes then he goes and can i talk to you one day you can but the thing is i told you to go and sit over there for 10 you are like you like to be yogi yogi don't depend on others he has to control his own mind and now i have some questions so he's a public he's setting his foot he wants to know he's asking questions he's reading book he is also having some conception about god but that conception of god is very very shallow we can say i told what do you want after practicing yoga you know what he said i want to open my third eye and then what will happen when the third eye is open that i don't know but i read somewhere that if a little tada is open you can see everything in this world and suppose you see everything in this world then what will happen i don't know but i am interested to open the third eye look at it this is called title very good try to open your third eye but it will take long time you have to you should have patience now he has not asked me whether you have opened your third eye or not so that way i am safe now this is the conception the third eye should be there four faces will be there so many hands will be there all this in the beginning all you ask so many people they're all devoted people ask them the conception of god all these things who are they they are only the beginner that is also having a conception of god second sadhakar those who are practicing some spiritual discipline like doing puja doing japa chanting god's name fasting going to different holy places they're all sadhaka they're trying to understand it more clearly and that is the reason we have to understand that different people with different notion they are coming and when they are coming over here they are thinking that whatever they know that is perfect without knowing not knowing the total clear thing totally totally because it depends on the experiences spiritual experiences so this swadhaka he has started the work and then sit there he is real he has realized but in know from his inner experience that god exists that's all he feels the god exists as i sometimes tell see the huge program that we could organize over here almost from the the from wherever all help came we do not know but it came so that proves the help of god the god exists even sometimes i do not know the takus titi puja day the supposed to be a snowy day rough day rough weather but that morning i was praying to god that this is the only day once in a year that people like to come to you and if the weather is like this how they will come can't you make it up to two o'clock so that they will come and they will take prasad and go some people and up to three o'clock it was very clear weather november when people were almost all of them the local people they were telling that it is a very wrong decision because it may rain and ganges and hair it may rain it may snow it may be difficult all those days a very clear day can't we think that all this is the blessings of god we can so that way some conception of the god faith in god believe in god and many many times when it is happening we start the way yes it is this i i think i told you that thing that happened in my life the incident four of us after sannyasa we went to kidarnath from the base you have to climb almost 11 or 13 kilometer climbing on the top it's a very narrow path and you have to walk sometimes the people are going by the horseback also so obviously you have to be very careful it is slippery and we purchase some plastic because sometimes it will be rain it may rain so some plastic so that ah we will cover ourselves if it rains you are not having the umbrellas or the raincoats we went to kedarnath you offered our pranam but when coming down it started raining and it was snowing also and some storm was also there we opened the plastics it was of no use because of the wind gusty wind it immediately we had to leave it we were almost wrenching there was no place to take shelter now i pray to taku taku all the four of us will die when we'll reach over there the 11 13 kilometer is not a matter of joke it will take long time the road is becoming slippery we have to work and if it goes on raining like this i don't think that we will survive please stop it and in exchange i will go on singing your name songs then i started singing whatever songs i could remember i was singing believe it or not rain stopped immediately and there was sunshine then i was going about continuing the song while walking is very difficult because descending you are coming down from the hill so in one place i forgot that i promised it and after some time again i found the wind the rain and the snow i remembered i am sorry sorry i'll sing then i started singing it stopped again the sun shine then in one corner we found as a tea shop the country tasha we sat over there to have a tea then i told my friends the swamis that this thing happening but it is impossible for me to continue so you also join with me i will sing one line you also join so that i get the rest one of them the scientist he told all these things he was still keeping in your mind this is nothing this is in the at the hill it always happen in this corner there is uh there's rain in that corner it is sunshine don't be like that right okay if you think like that but the moment we got out of the shop and was walking it started raining i told please join me or you will die then you started singing it stopped we came down safely then after coming down our guest house that guest house it has broken the uh the big guest house of the bharat savashar sangha it's a nice guest house it was so that we could see the door is over there so that we let us stop we won't sing let us see what will happen and when we are walking stop that prayer it started raining and it rained so hard torrential we drained we ran and somehow entered into that and i prayed to takur please excuse me long afterwards i was it was also very much it was raining in one place we went to chirapanji heavily raining the senior swami he was sitting he's supposed to go what will happen even on the road there is water accumulated what will happen how to take him then what to do some discussion then i told narrated this story to him and said swamiji do you think it is really because i prayed to tagore and it happened he looked at me still doubting he said still you are doubting so this thing happened happened to many people's life and that way slowly people get faith in god because their experiences and so many people experiences he will find it is like that ramakrishna nandaji who was in south india in madras people were not knowing sirama krishna over there so naturally donation was very less one day there was nothing not a muscle of food to cook for taco and then he went and shouted to taco okay you won't give some food okay i i will offer the sand i am going to the beach bring some sand then fry the sand and offer it to you and i will also eat that sand let me try you don't like to you like to make that uh take that examination okay let's see my faith he was about to go out of the door certainly one person unknown came with so much of vegetables and other cooking things other things to cook it happened when you read in the life of ramakrishna namdaji we wonder we when we read in the life of lokeshwaranandaji it happened so many things in so many lives can't we believe it that there's a grace of god so that way slowly slowly when one realize god within himself and feels that the existence of god every moment sit there and then finally perfect siddha means perfect supremely perfect there is no doubt in his mind so it does sit there supremely perfect that is we find that our swami all these great souls supremely perfect because they know that it is possible and they believe in it so in the vedanta also we find brahmagya brahmabid brahmavid baryan and brahmavir barista this four type of classification in brahma-yana also suramar krishna was explaining from the point of view of the vaishnavas pravartak sadak siddhya and siddhar siddhya that means the one just started a beginner sadaka who is practicing austerity siddha a perfect one and supremely perfect one and similarly we find the brahmagya brahmavid brahmavir baryana brahmavir barista so it doesn't mean that one the moment he realized god immediately he is equal to everyone no there are differences and differences of this type of classes of his experiences then suramar krishna is telling you know how one goes in this way suppose someone is searching the master in a dark room and he goes inside it is so dark it is difficult to see anything he goes on touching first he is touching the almirah then a table then a chair and every time he is touching he said no no it is not my master it is not my master it is not my master like this when he reaches to that bed and touched that person he said yes you have to advance like this you have to say this is not god this is not god this cannot be god this is not this and then finally when you really realize god from your within from your inside you can feel this is god and there'll be no doubt about it you needed to go and ask anyone but then he said but in order to realize god one must assume one of the attitudes santia garcia madhura the five different attitudes master mahashay sriman he asked three questions and the last question was how to realize god sudama krishna is explaining how to realize god you have to accept one attitude what is the attitude according to your temperament santia shantia means it is the attitude of the rishis so many things are going on but i am not part of i am not disturbed i am not attached nothing is affecting my tranquility i know all these things but he will never raise his finger to stop it something bad something good so many things are going on it's just like observer going on observing without any reaction physically sometimes we do not do but mentally oh this should be like this that should be like that why they are not doing like this why they are doing like that we go on thinking so that is not the attitude of the shanta they are completely tranquil they are not at all perturbed by anything all the changes and so many things happen in this world seeing all these they are unperturbed because they know this is the work of god this is called shantia the industry is perfect he is having his personality his knowledge is everything but at the same time totally dedicated to god that's why again and again as an example traditionally they say it is mahavira anumanji anumanji was a great saint it was a very perfect knowledge in veda physically also very strong courageous he could do anything and everything himself he was a yogi he could took the form of a very small thing or a very big one even then all his knowledge he dedicated at the feet of ramachandra is not just a slave i have written an article swami vivekananda his in his in one of his poems he's mentioning this he's mentioning about sirama krishna and masada i am the servant of you too how a personality like vivekananda can say that i am the servant it's not humbleness it is his realization it is this way to realize god totally dedicated to taku and when he is coming back to india the people are giving praising him he is telling don't do that if you have to praise praise the name of sirama krishna so that humbleness that is called dasya shakya like the arjuna he was very free with bhagavan sri krishna it's like shakyabhaba i think oli bhul she was having that relation with swami vivekananda and she used to go to swamiji and she used to say that swamiji is my friend either miss mcleod or oliver i may be making other and one of them that lady she helped swamiji here in america in so many ways she arranged everywhere swamiji's lectures see how these devotees are working the devotees they are working as a second line of defense how they organize the program then invite the swami and then spread the message they will be inviting their friends and relatives and the neighbors spreading the message they'll be and this miss oliver and the this ladies over here in america they did so many things about swamiji spreading the help him to spread the message and she used to say i am the friend of swamiji i'm not a disciple when the young swamis used to ask what is your age she was elderly she used to say i count my age from the day when i met swami vivekananda and this is the devotee so devoted she used to go with her shoe on to swami vivekananda's room this is my friend's room why should i have to put off my shoe she used to go and sit on the bed of swamiji my friends wait i have every right to sit over here so she is to behave swamiji because our attitude was friendly so this way we find the santia dasya sakya then batsalia yashoda again and again this is the classical examples yashoda she used to feel and she has seen krishna when the krishna opened the mouth she saw the whole universe is within the mouth of krishna she saw it but again she used to feel no if i am not protecting krishna what will happen to that child if i am not feeding him if i am not taking care what will happen that is the motherly attitude even to god cons constantly thinking about god but not as a devotee but as someone with love trying to give service and protection to god so that is called motherly love motherly affection both salia and madhura that is the attitude of the radha and then finally we find srama krishna is introducing another attitude santana attitude of a child a child only believe that my parent is there my mother is there my father is there and careless the child knows the parents will take everything all care will be taken by them i need not to bother about anything about the food about the dress about anything only what he has to do or she has to do the child has to do believing and then praying i want this much money i have to purchase these i have to go over there i like to do that i like to do this he is sure that i am going to get it because he is the father suramar krishna is also telling if you totally believe that god is your mother or your father you have every demand on you you need not to pray go and demand what is it you are my father and i am suffering why should you not give you are bound to give so like that only how it comes complete faith so master mashay asked three questions and sirama krishna gave the reply first what is the meaning of realization of god suramar krishna said at different stages the meaning is different then he said isha darshan kake bali that reply also he gave in that the one he may feel that there is existence of god another who is supremely perfect knows it well so ishar darshan means that idea sometimes people will say i don't believe god because no one has seen have you tried to see it if you have not tried then how can you understand it so that is the way you have to uh understand the isha darshan different labels are there some people only thinking about and some people they have really realized it see ramakrishna is one another place is telling some people have heard the name of milk heard the name of men some have seen it white liquid some had drank the milk and became strong they are supremely perfect so the difference of degrees are there in god realization too how to realize god then he said you have to take one attitude i have to ask myself what is my attitude there are different type of attitude different type of temperament accordingly i should develop that attitude towards god so today after this and next we will discuss about how sirama krishna is explaining these examples let us offer our pranam to takur nirang foreign is m namaste you
