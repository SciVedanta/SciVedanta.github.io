[25: Panchama Veda 25: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfi72wWU_SA)

listening the answer that bhagavan sri ramakrishna has given to the questions the doubts that was raised what is the way for householder to realize god that was the question what is the way for the householder sri ramakrishna gave the answer again the question was what is the good of holy company jaja shangai palki what is the good of holy company then the third why does a man have sinful tendencies so that also answered by sri ramakrishna why has God created wicked people that was the fourth question and today we will hear the answer of ceramic ISNA to the question said is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life of a householder is a very important question they are very few who are sannyasins maybe one person of the total population may be less than that then this huge people mass number if they don't get their realization only point one person who will get the realization is it possible so that was the doubt and this huge group are they out of the blessings of God what is religion then only maintaining some of the norms some of them it hurts so these are the questions so nicely answered by see ramakrishna solving all the doubts as i was telling and mostly we all no when the method is very simple we don't like it when the method is very difficult we think that is the religion we must practice otherwise what so this is the only problem what is religion there raghavan see Ramakrishna he is giving the answer to this question huge then householders said is it ever possible to realize God while leading the life of a householder then he is answering certainly but as I said just now one must leave in holy company and pray unceasingly continuously pray the continuous spray what happens to for by that because when we are praying to God our thought is in that prayer and what is the human being is thought so naturally when we are constantly thinking of God we are transforming slowly purifying slowly what is the purification ego self consciousness I consciousness body consciousness which can be termed in one word selfishness so that is the main thing main idea and that way we are changing the more we are thinking of God more these things are changing one of the subject that will be discussed in our paint and a member program because that whole program is on the basis of swami vivekananda's call that he gave on 27th September 1893 the last lecture in that problem to religion help and not fight assimilation and not destruction harmony and peace and not dissension that is the whole of religion now different religious people they will becoming Christian Islam Buddhism Jainism they will be expressing their views from the point of view of the Christianity how we can help each other those who are not Christians those who are Christians can they help each other can they grow together respecting each other that is the way we have to understand so this is the most of the people that make mystic the moment the thing that is a religion means some of the processes and you must have to follow that but ultimately religion lead to spirituality sri ramakrishna is talking about the spirituality when he's talking about the religion about God is telling about leading us to towards the spirituality first January kalpataru d the excellent thing happened when from the human body he expressed the power of God that He is God himself and what blessings he gave all of you get consciousness realized consciousness that's all the moment we become that conscious then the whole religion changes otherwise it becomes the method only process only and they re fight everybody has this process different type of process all processes leading to the same goal if not the process there is a mistake in the process if you are putting the rice in the hot water it's supposed to become the boiled rice which is eatable raw rice boiled how in this certain temperature if the term temperature is less it won't be papa it is very high it won't be popper so the temperature should be so it is boiling the rise and it becomings are eatable thing so you have to understand that follow that if even then the rice is not boiling that means some defect is there in the process if i am not generating love there's defective in the process though i may say that this is my religion i may kill myself or kill others in the name of religion and we go on shouting about that religion but it's a faulty path sure why the result is not there that is why I ramakrishna again and again telling when this gentleman is asking is it ever possible because all other teachers they said no without the sannyasa you cannot realize God all this that you see the world a full of misery and unless you renounce this you cannot realize God this true but suppose I am there inside the world can I not realize God yes ceramic witnesses how by holy company and what only company will teach you that each and every being is nothing but the manifestation of God so we have requested three of our armies to speak from the viewpoint of the bush neighbors from the viewpoint of the tantric us tantra from the viewpoint of the vedanta whether we can heal it help each other if you go to the people who are practicing Jana yoga they'll be constantly denouncing others they think this is the only part nothing like later as they call those who are only dealing with the later they say nothing like later everything should be through this that is their part so this is what see Ramakrishna says and what if holy person should do who can be called as only person here we find certainly but as I said just now one must leave in holy company and pray on seizing Lee so that is the constant prayer is minding and what the Guru will teach what the holy person will teach to be brought so that is the thing the person will be telling afterwards one should weep for God and when the impurities of the mind that does was to be one realizes God very clear then he is not teaching anything else one should weep for God cry for God and when the impurities are what is the impurity impurity is ego that is the ability so many people all through their life they will be practicing religion but unfortunately they neighbor raid with Ramakrishna and that is the reason they could not get the idea where actually they are tied down he is giving when justice small through a small story a wonderful model three-person dunker they crossed the river to drink maybe that there are the drinks were without tax so it was cheap so they went over there drank and then when you were coming they knew how to row the boat when they were coming or all through the night they weigh in down during the board but the next morning they found their only there because they forgot to untie the boat it was tied by the row it is there similarly all through our life we are practicing religion religion religion and we are so sincere about the holy water and holy food and holy this thing and that thing but the unholy thing is my ego that is living within me so without that without eradicated that I cannot move even an inch we do not understand that we do not know that the people who are practicing Vedanta what is Vedanta the God is in every being that is Vedanta he shava shava Dom sarvam a comes a bit prob Adama than all this Vedanta and the people who are so serious about Vedanta they don't like to see the faces of others I went over there i SAT with our devotees when they were serving the food Prashad they say Prashad means that something which God has taken so it is very purifying when you were accepting that food you are supposed to be purified but how can we when they're throwing it from almost three feet away just ruin the liquid thing can you imagine on the plate and the people are sitting like this covering their body so that when it splashes and then they are eating it I told up come let me be sinful only what to do what I won't eat that way one cannot eat so that is the peculiar idea of these people were thinking that they're so pure I am holier than thou attitude don't touch me don't need all these things come so this is way they say Sri Ramakrishna stealing can you cry for God we for God in impurities will go automatically you need not to do anything else only simple way like a child with a simple only pray to God I want to see you I want to talk to you I haven't to feel that you are here can you not come to me Who am I i'm also a creation of you then why should I have to serve like this maybe that I have done something mystic some in my past life so I am in this condition but you are the person who can give the punishment who can eradicate that you are the doer and undo I so please come please come please then the person will automatically come God will surely come and ceramic kitchen is challenging to one person he said the e Phi R turn the name of Durga three times and then died it is the duty of the mother Durga to take me because I have taken her name and the moment I take her name I become pure even even then she is not coming as a mother of the universe then people will not have any feet on earth so it is hard problem i will tell people so I sincerely called upon our but she has not come I mean durga durga durga bola jodimarie akira amari not ro kimoni the Akasha big ocean is a challenge so here the similar way see Ramakrishna's kept telling then again the person is asking then householders too will have the vision of God owned a doubt is not great because so many years they have heard the householder means they cannot have so that is the problem what is the household some of the duties that we are performing and if that duty we can perform in this as a service of God what happens it becomes a Monday it becomes a temple so that is the attitude only when they are changing that is why I ramakrishna is telling if you just turn your mind if you are turning the mind you get everything so simple but it is difficult for the people to follow if you give the process then only they like it natural normal thing is very difficult to follow you must do these you must do that otherwise is not attractive if you say these you have to do the some name you have to be very attractive name and then you give one two three four point six points you give and then your 10 people like it they think they are doing something this super Barcia the fasting in all religion it is their fasting suppose I am NOT eating food am i becoming pure really then there are hundreds and thousands and millions of people they don't get food they're hungry all the time at the hall pure just because they couldn't get eat food can that be then people think that if we go and wait in the Ganga we become pure of course but who is becoming pure your body or mind if it is body thousands of people living with a side of ganga on the bank of ganga regularly they go and wave regularly so one mirabai she is telling millions of fish and other things are there inside the water are they all pure only realizing God just because they are there in the water so that is the idea some people are thinking just by worshipping is small piece of stone I will realize God Meera is telling why stone Eve by worship in stone you can realize God why small piece I will worship the whole Hill Chris small piece she is telling if by eating only fruits and milk you realize God then all the monkeys would have got the realization by this time full moon  Alima late bother bother I she is a bish Nava that is the excellent way you have to understand is not the food it is not the bathing Serrano Krishna is telling you go to your holy company what is the holy company who will help you to understand these and that is very rare and that is why he is telling the householder to will have the vision of God all day every body will surely be liberated but one should follow the instructions of the Guru this is the difficulty do love'em try me by thought the evonik a to give a doula bomb try me bata de van a girl a to come Devon ooga booga here to come Manu septum moo moo shu trunk then maha purusha Thomas Raya this is very difficult the ultimate thing is Maha Purusha thomas doyle only with the grace of God we get this Maha purush on Australia otherwise no today we went replace the whole day we were there and naturally when they talk a Swami religious questions all the doubts and come and one person nowadays I up everywhere the hindutva there now it is going on so the question was like all other religious people why we are not having one command I told bless God the place by the blessings of God we are free not not under any command if the person who is in the command making mistake everybody left suffer if the person over there on the top if you accept him as the one man and if he says all our ladies should cover their face what will happen to our ladies if they say no of our lady should go to school then we had to wait for the another Malala then so many difficulties are there just because of that you are not understanding this what is the problem for you now we are not United and what you are not ignite everybody is united so this is the conception but it is very difficult to hear a white bra with the Bronco dharna the wrong conception the moment you become spiritual all these things will go that again and again I tried to make them understand there is a religion and then spirituality the religion has all this sort of thing but it is making it is in the process then through that process one become a spiritual person and if you kill that spiritual person that spirituality only go for the ritual only go for the methods what will happen you will suffer look at this look at the history learn from that then only will understand very educated people they are not illiterate villagers I'll educated people conception is not clear about religion so that is why I Ramakrishna is so important that is why be waken and is so important why no nothing no new thing they are not introducing anything new only they are telling the what it should mean that's all what it should be so this is the way we have to ceramic ISNA is answering every body will surely be liberated and the same thing Shami be vacant is telling that we have every demand on the god page we have to realize God and then we will say I am God myself that is our demand OD god I'm a general dirty Carla the moment we take birth in a human form human being you have every right to realize God why because this community power has been given to you and through the discriminative power you have to understand thing then with the emotion you have to proceed first you are going in with the emotion you are attached you can never come out of that this is the thing when we are working for God the only thing that should be in our mind not the clapping zuv the people are the good and appreciative walls of the people it should be only the blessings of God after the whole work that we do we have to go to God and ask Kaku are you happy and I done everything all right is there any mistake if there is any mistake please don't take it otherwise i will try to rectify it please help me to it you that is the prayer constant constant xiaomi ranganathan used to tell are you a better person every night you must ask yourself are you a better person are you feeling for others that is the process in developing almost everywhere no one says like these they'll be constantly telling you calm you do you did and then what happens is a shot of it because we like to work within ourselves we have so much of power so much of strain so much of intellect and we do like to utilize a new you utilize for the holiness holy thing but only small one thing is left that nobody points out that is what's ramakrishnan is telling turn your mind when you are turning the mind means understanding he is telling if you are living in the worldly life no problem but apply the oil fast and then break the jackfruit without applying the oil if you are trying to break the jackfruit it a sticky thing will be there on your skin it to be very difficult to clean similarly when we are entering into the samsara what is that samsara the household what is that only motion what is the relation emotion and wonderful emotion and they that is the binding force cementing force but we doubt the oil without the discrimination if we are applying it suffering suffering and suffering so this is the thing whenever we are developing that so this is the way he stirring anyone and everyone can but he is asking you just refer to the instructions of the Guru how shall we find him the very wonderful question how shall we find the Guru anyone and everyone cannot be a guru categorically is telling why the guru means who has already passed that otherwise he cannot teach all these things he have already covered till now siyum bhima baba Yaga in the be a catcher ominous and greater is telling tierna crossed siam he himself was already Ross this ocean of samsara what is the ocean of samsara attachment it is me and mine that's the and so difficult to cross that very very difficult these NASA me mama Varnado everything we are doing is meme it is mine everything part inside you know nothing is going to stay with me nothing is going to go with me everything will be here only why should I suffer for them Mon Charlie Joe Nick attorney oh my mind now let us go back to the own aboard mona Charen new journey kéthani so that is the song that swami vivekananda sang before see ramakrishna and he went into Samadhi samsara videshi BD she's wishy like a foreigner you are here in this world this is not ours just like a foreigner you are here so the when the coroner comes over here he never cares about the election that is going on over here for who is going to be the president of America with this from what party conservative or what so please not bother he is going and taking the snaps of different type of places and he is very happy Oh neat and clean everything is so nice if they are not harassing in the airport he's acting unlike that he is enjoying everything without suffering white no attachment but the local people are very very attentive to know who is going to the president because the whole policy will change because we are will be affected by the policy so that is the reason attachment those who are in the politics they are constantly calculating who will be these will be that where I am where I'm not and those who are not in the politics no problem for them so everything in our life we know it is the attachment the moment we take it so seriously this is the problem so this way we have to understand and then one thing will come in the mind that is a wonderful tranquility solace the tranquility the soulless will calm you know when we are joining in this organization and then learning the things it's not so easy so very difficult those who are coming we are not uneducated people all of the majority of them they were very highly placed people now they have joined they have asked them to go and do all menial things and then they'll be scolding them then all these things you have to go on on and on you know there is a one sharmaji in belair mod and in the in our training for the two years you have to do everything right from cleaning that bathrooms and going to the shrine and practicing all these things cleaning the shrine also there's a one Schwalm EG who was doing the puja what used to do is to sprinkle de that is called the paste white paste on the white tiles and very white tiles and jungle and he'll be sprinkling jungen here and there white and on the white tiles obviously right thing you cannot see and then some of the rice white rice you'll be putting here and there then years ago clean so naturally the boy will be clicking how he will know where he has sprinkled days and they're certain general the clean but sometimes you have to go and rob otherwise it don't come out to stick things and then he will come he knows where it is oh you have cleaned very good let me then you'll come a it is this then he'll score so that our ego totally good and I was so lucky the Brahma cherry mirage who was just before me he was handling giving down the charge to me to clean he said secretly as because that swami ji was not there he said see this is the way he tests then I told how to find was I have developed almost at the end of my duties two months 60 days so either in the 50 days and the up to that I'd understood that if you lie down and see like this keeping your cheek on the floor then you can see that these things at the end then you lie at the center and as we do the pronoun you know put her face like there you see this side and like this they see this side there first thing that you go and clean that then you will be free other things are normal all my two months duty he could not find me and gave me a wonderful certificate so he is the only person so perfect because I knew the secret so similarly of course after me everybody understood then what is the sacred and he understood that that examination won't work some other things you have to follow so this way we are tested and every time you are scolded so that is the way you grow why then the ego will go ego will go ego you go and the moment ego goes you were renovated it's not that the person who is shouting at you he is not benefited benefit it for the person who can understand it take it properly and then he gives everything that he is having because these are the people only giving the training my goal is Saroja Krishna my goal is the god so obviously they go on like this ultimately they realize god this is the wonderful thing and have the faith faith like that milk maid who cross the river walking though the Guru was not having the faith though he said but she was having the complete faith if a person taking the name of God having faith on god can cross the ocean why not what ocean is the so big thing when a river I can cross the river so that simple faith sri ramakrishna told the story if you have the faith don't bother about who has given you the instruction we were gives take it seriously and then we create faith you just go and the only thing that God loves is that dear if you can cry sincerely with a playful heart but the difficulty is to get the Guru of course then how we our I will know who is my guru I have some attitudes and that attitude some people and one person may be guiding properly and that is called the perfect guru see Ramakrishna is giving the training to Shami Vivekananda same salaam krishna giving training to others different he is telling master much I too fast practice fast that will be good for you and for xiaomi Vivekananda you never said that you must trust he said the God is in everything why don't you practice that so because be wakin on there was an advanced student so it was not necessary so one thing is not for everyone I love to serve people and when I am serving people I should think I am sobbing my god even the person is not praising you doesn't matter I am serving my god in my best way that's all so this type of attitude when I am following know it for sure perfect guru will come perfect teacher will come because in the form of that guru God will help you when Drew was a young boy he wanted to sit on the lap of his father was a king but there is another mother stepmother didn't allow him to go and she banished him from there the poor little boy came to his mother and said I want to sit on the lap of my father as my other brother is sitting why I am not getting the opportunity the mother said son I cannot help you then he said who can help me that above God that is above the king that is God if you pray to God and only you can then he went to the jungle the little boy not knowing what is jungle there are all ferocious animals of the air Tigers are there d him seeing his faith when he was walking and praying to God neruda him God send him go guide the boy then our other told this way if you are doing it don't do you take the name of God one name and go on praying and meditating then only it will be helpful so one name of God Narada gave him that name and asked him sit over here don't go here and there seat over here call God then he will come he went on taking the name of God see the through the stories wonderful idea they are giving he went on taking the name of God so who gave the name guru who sent the Guru God how could he understand because guru was all this positive and helping neighbor will ask I suddenly there's a never never if you are serving okay not serving there's also okay the best way to serve the Guru is to follow his words so that is the thing we have to understand the physical service anyone can give even anyone can come and sup the Guru but who will really serve the Guru by following his words who is becoming real educated in spiritual life that is the good ones so when the Gruber was meditating brain slowly slowly God one day when all mind was verified God came when the Vishnu came before him and ask my son what do you want he said I want you but but remember you came over here after leaving your mother SAT over here with a prayer what was the prayer that you will go and sit on the lap of your father isn't it though I don't bother about that now I understood that that is not the place i must get you if i get God if I realize God all these father mother everything that we all right but now so that we start a team with a small prayer can you please give me this position can you please help me in this way slow to but the more the mind become purified we understand that God is the only thing that we must pay for look at the examination that see Ramakrishna touka-sama Vivekananda that time whole family was starving vivekanandan or in the North they graduate in those days were not finding any job ultimately he came to see Ramakrishna for help and ceramic is marks today is Tuesday Saturday Tuesday and Saturday a very good day for goddess Kali she is in very good mood in this those days whatever you will pray we'll get today's Tuesday go and pray I say whatever you will pray that will be granted by the mother and you ain't win for what asking for a job so that he can help his family after reaching over there when he saw the Divine Mother fully presence is not the image but original Divine Mother he never made mistake because his mind was pure before him and that's why he prayed to mother Oh mother give me my raaga vivica etc etc that the power of discrimination devotion all this three times that is called purification of the mind we don't want anything of the worldly things but to do something good for the people when we are praying it's also pure when we are praying for god's army we become the spraying to taco ma I like to establish an organization of the young boys and girls educated and never care for themselves they will be spreading like the wildfire and then they will go on telling people that you are holy inside potentially divine when he visited divinity that they will do for the development of the whole human race I want to establish that organization he was praying to taco mother pray to tackle her organization why for the benefit of the others that type of prayer is not bad of course now I am praying can you guess what I am praying I think all of you know the word I am praying now after November that prayer will change now the one point we are only going on so this is the way when I what for I am doing not for the name or fame or anything nothing when a majority of the people cannot pronounce my name properly I am happy so they will forget only thing we want that let them be happy let them be good when the people are good families are happy when a happy family society is happy when the society is happy God is also happy so that begins with the individual unit and from that you need the whole thing and that's why again and again we are giving so much of stress on the human mind character behavior lifestyle this is that you live as you want only thing you pray to God that is exactly what ceramic ishness telling and he is telling what is knowledge the moment you were going to a religious person is true guru instead of making you confused one of our Swamiji jokingly used to say and sometimes in the meeting there will be question answer session and some people that will be always there in that one any group always leg asking question not for the answer not for to understand only for the question so they will go on asking question for the question sick so naturally they get all the importance all the time that is only thing so we have seen so one person who has begun asking question and that many swamiji's are sitting over there I tried in my best way to answer them afterwards when you all went inside Kostroma we are taking tea together then he said that's how much it jokingly say see if you cannot convince a pupa person used him so that is also to get lit your disturb so that is jokingly we should not make any confusion is very clear see this is our life and we are we will go on like this we should not deviate so this is the way the political movement social movement that is for the people who are in the society but the synergy they are totally different and what is what happens when the Guru comes he give a sachidananda alone is the Guru search it ananda who is a satchitananda the Bremen the God Himself when you order the word God it becomes a limited the Brahman all-pervading but we cannot concede the Brahman idea Brahman so God when the God is coming from that power coming the person before you in the Islam they say imam imam means the faithful one faithful to whom to God so that is the reason he is so since should be sincere that in no way I can have the people how do I know the god is not calling him if anybody is coming hey you should not come to our place you should go away you should be doing like these that we am I to say that some of the norms will surely maintain otherwise you know there is a table and on that table whatever they keep without my permission nobody touch without the schwa me jeez some movies except that it is their popped rice the nobody is touching if we say no everybody can do then next day I won't get that is the reason some of the that is not you don't come not like that one person came and he was asking why this boundary why we cannot go to the god you can but if everybody is going that purity won't be there because people do not know they won't understand so one person was leaking his fingers and then suddenly he is a good you wanted to serve me he said you wanted p sub chapati then with that you wanted to give me the chapati I don't know no it's okay thank you for you take that one you don't keep it you do it because he is already he is holding his saliva is there at least that tape a little thing we should practice that is for hygienic the doctors will also say that's why all people here whenever they will be serving they will be putting their gloves and then only they are solving what for it's not the head trade so this simple thing we have to understand for each and everything if you are questioning that it is difficult in the general normal life in the society like there are some things that we have to maintain so this is the thing we should not mix of it the religion and that is called guru means such it on and thus aruba God himself and what is God love purity patience perseverance all those things combined together do you get that in a human being very little hole percentage it is impossible except the God accepted see Ramakrishna it is impossible I told them you perhaps one person came to one of our Center in the Midnight Run ker with a bottle of wine and he said hey open the door I'm girish course he did he has read the books of ceramic ISNA and girish and all that suddenly after drinking he thought that his giddy she came and knocked from inside the schwa me say there is no Saddam Krishna here so you go so you may be the girish but who is the other Krishna we cannot accommodate you as the donkey schnapp good so you cannot expect that thing but God saying the Guru and that guru is achieve Ananda and he gives the knowledge what is the knowledge and what is the nature of this ego God alone is deur and none else that is the knowledge God alone his doer some people will be so Sid sincere in doing things who is giving that idea to them God if you think I'm doing wrong again if I have got some idea to do something good is it God's will that is the way guru teaches why ego vanishes the young when i joined i went for marketing came back I was getting scolding and criticism from my gosh swami ji when I was little angry then he said you were expecting praise from the words of praising oh this boy he has done this thing that think you're expecting that and that is why you are not happy the moment I will praise you you'll be happy but are you doing the work for me if you are doing for me you will always suffer if you are doing for the human being you'll always suffer but if you are doing for the God know it for sure he is constantly watching and he will be benefited blessed sure Swami Vivekananda's telling who will be working for that this thing and he will get the blessings of divine mother I coated that in our this thing so many people coming forward to hell can I bless them have I am I have I'm having that power no I can only pray to God so this all people came and they are helping me in so many different ways so many and they're doing much better than me please bless them and do you think God on surely whoever will work for God will get the blessings of God sure so whatever work that we are doing then he says therefore I say o mother thou art the operator and i am the machine thou are the indweller and i am the house they are the driver I'm the carriage I move as da movies I mean I do as thou makest me to do I speak as thou makest me speak not I not I but thou but thou swami ji who came from portland he was telling everyone they will between ipad iphone now he has changed it now paired out one because we are learning it right from the or childhood not I've a doubt and in our later also when I am writing I am mentioning we are very happy that you are coming then they taught me in American should not right we who are we resume responsible so always right I have received your letter I am happy i will be doing aye aye aye aye so when we are type typing I all the time I am mentally telling Tucker it is you so what to do yes mean Daisy udara in whatever place you what you have to behave because it is also true you are supposed to when you are writing you are supposed to be responsible it's ok but that I should not bind me that is the thing then see Rama Krishna is teaching from the Purim that piranha Krishna's housed the master went to Cornell bisha knots and from there to Lily cottage that Bichon up here in English they have not given that conversation I don't know why maybe afterwards but in Bengali they put it this Swami who came they were doing this chronologically so here it comes in the kisha and that it is 1875 first time ceramic is not made tea shop chunder Shan it would only say a few words and ketchup jungler Shane was very famous in those days even the Queen Victoria invited him to dine with all that type of know what's called respect and honor that he was getting unthinkable for any Indians in those days then obviously everybody was talking about Keisha Keisha band Kesha and he was known all over the undivided India and that keshab he was fluent in English he was very scholarly person he was known to all him ceramic is me wanted to meet him now who is surround kisne he is a priest only in the dictionary and that to you neighbor control is done so obviously when he said I want to meet keshab his companion that his nephew with Iran he was afraid he knew his maternal uncle yes no he will go and say something and it will create problem so he tried to persuade the ceramic ich nur not to go to keisha but he said no mother is doing inside means always whenever he used to do something or say something it is from the command of the Divine Mother so obvious is no no I must go I have to go then the meeting was arranged before see Ramakrishna's meeting khushab this hour that nephew went his eye round and he wanted to give a good picture about sri ramakrishna my maternal uncle is a very religious person he did because that is the only think that he can say about the Ramakrishna he has no property as no education is nothing to what to say did he say he constantly go on talking about God thinking about God meditate on God etc so that to impress kesha he was giving the introduction of Serrano Krishna and he was perhaps going on praying the ceramic yishun of behave properly but when see Ramakrishna first came and he said Oh Keisha you have lost your tail look at you k sharp 21 lage cautiously Jimmy still means what the monkeys or something like that is other animals the other people they were taken aback why this person is talking like this but Keisha look at it she'd never took this word as an insert he said when he is telling this it must be having a meaning then he accept what is the meaning of it that you were telling my tail has now gone off what is the meaning of it then he was narrating the wind there is a they call it taught that pole they'll bang Ajit at Paul the sir that is there is having a tail only and it can be only in the water it cannot come up on the dry land but when it goes and it becomes a frog it can live in the water it can come out of water also so you are like that now you can live in the society you can leave as a sannyasi both qualities are there within you k shop said look at it through the very ordinary apparently insulting word what he is telling the highest regard he is giving to that Kishore Chandra shame so that way he is meeting and then he is telling all this conversation next day we will discuss next tuesday we'll discuss about it ceramic ISNA said that we must have to go on chanting days anything and everything that is going on by the will of God otherwise not I am really feeling here many of other places see I came here only seven months and now so many people now I know the sunday the evening the program that we could organize at the university of chicago think of it that the university of chicago means it was so difficult nineteen thirty in chicago arizona started and now this 2013 we could enter into the university of chicago to organize the program that too on Vivekananda is it just because of me know so that is the power of God is thinking that it should be done I am only in front at least that is my luck he has chosen me that's all so that way things are going on I believe it and I will ask you believe it it's not an ordinary thing that you are doing 150th birthday anniversary or Vivekananda that we are going to observe in different manner so many different people so many different proposals whatever it may be maybe they're little chaotic it may be in the only for Swami's came to from outside one from Portland and myself but on the gphi and there are so much of care as the food is not there we go so now and of course different type of swami one swami came he will never take salt in his with his food so a separate then another came no I'll at our salts of all right but no I was another and little salt little Oh another so like this so many and naturally those who are serving they are confused and then when 50 of them will come I don't know what is going to happen but anyway those who have offered that to become the host that is their problem I don't know so it is really like that it will go but everything that we are thinking really i'm feeling so shockingly tomari ichcha eat chow mein tera to me tomorrow coeur MO tommy kuruma looking for a korea me it is your will only and people think that i am doing that should be the attitude that should be the attitude i know that i am not doing is all you were doing so that way if we can lead our life know it for sure the bureaucracy ramakrishna has promised we are going to realize god obviously no doubt so that is way we should pray thank you very much for coming let us agree to taco and offer our pranaam needin janam nityam anantara bum bak tonneau compa Drita big tomboy yavitt arum para misha medium tamarama krishnam sheer asana mama home Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry home that's it sweet ama krishna eponymous to the coming Saturday there will be the Durga Puja not coming saturday morning will be coming will be distributing some of the papers then we'll be trying to chant the trendy and then some prayer song and do like them and the pooja will go on well done performing puja and we be so this is a unique thing not this is the time when all the divine power manifest it is not that it's not there every throw out of the year to the air but is a special thing sometimes some that yoga as they call more they come that particular term this is the time from thirsty to the shebeen this is the five days maximum power of God that manifest but that is the time we must go or consider at his face of the Divine Mother at meeting so that now there are three and all those things that the practice so that is the reason because that divine power absurd and we must take the benefit of that you
