[122. Panchama Veda 122 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCBEYlv5vJo)

let us begin with this stotra tabaka Tom rhythm dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Cal Mashaba ham shravana mangalam srimad additem booby green aunty a buried Arjun aha today we will find the other ones Ramakrishna the very exalted mode and here master Masha he is giving the whole account of the Wednesday October 10 1883 is the page number 301 of the gospel of sri ramakrishna other had invited the master to come to his house on the occasion of the durga puja festival it was the third day of the worship of the Divine Mother that means ostomy thirsty septa me and ostomy when see Ramakrishna arrived at others house he found others frame sarada balarama father others neighbors and relatives waiting for him this is the way see Ramakrishna started giving out his messages Lord Buddha after the realization he came to the kashi banaras he invited other knowledgeable people pundits and then he talked about his own philosophy and the same way we find a Shankar Acharya but the vagabond see Ramakrishna he is going to the very ordinary people the simple people is going to a devotees house and then asking him to invite the neighbors and frames and that way he is giving his own messages the master went into the worship Hall to see the evening worship when it was over he remained standing there in an abstracted mode and sang in the praise of the Divine Mother out of my deep affliction rescue me Oh Redeemer there's a bengali song and he sang that song he was a very good singer and when he is to be in that mood is to express his feeling through the songs and that was wonderful the master wing to others drawing room on the second floor and took a seat surrounded by the guests still in a mood of divine farver he said gentlemen have eaten now go and enjoy the feast this is where the aim master Marsha is giving the comment see Rama Krishna didn't take any food he was invited there but how come that he is telling and in that mood he is telling that i have taken the gentleman i have eaten now go and enjoy the feast the other master marsha commenting and very correctly he is commenting was the master that means the ramakrishna hinting that the divine mother had partaken others offering this is very interesting and a point to note the wind the serrano Krishna he is one with the divine mother that very moment but the people all around him so many people are there they are there they couldn't understand but from the feeling only and he said in this way did he identify himself with the Divine Mother and therefore say I have eaten the master Mercia he is thinking then addressing the Divine Mother see Ramakrishna continued shall I eat o mother or will you eat o mother the very embodiment of the divine please did the master look on himself as one with the divine mother had the mother incarnated herself as the Sun to instruct ma'am mankind in the ways of God was this why the master said I have eaten so he is going on pondering over this particular thing when you go to a holy person in a holy place or hear something or read something if we can go deep into that particular thought we cannot understand what it exactly mean suppose someone is just going reading the book that is the gospel of the Ramakrishna in this page when he will read I have eaten out gentlemen I have taken food you go they will naturally think that the normal usually the people just see like this Master Mercia was present over there so he is giving this idea but he has not taken food why he is telling like that then again he is talking with the mother divine mother in that state of divine ecstasy see Ramakrishna saw the six centers in his body the Yogi's usually they see the six centers when the meditate the shop tabu me as according to the yoga the human body is having this up the booming and then here Sri Ramakrishna is talking with people it's roaming around not that he is sitting closing eyes are meditating but that time even he is seeing the six centers and the Divine Mother dwelling in them he sang his song to the effect again he sang my pop keep heavy pour on Galu my mind is over armed with Wonder pondering the mothers mystery her very name removes the fear of color Death himself beneath her feet lies mahakala this the kali puja is coming and of course this weekend we will go all to all of us to the Ganges and we'll have the discussion on the Tantra and of course in the Tantra about the colleague that discussion will come and hear salam o Krishna said coating that Kamala Cantor I do not understand what actually mother is an overall amrit wonder why because just to heal her name that take away all fear and look at her mahakala that the Sheba himself the destroyer are lying under her feet so this is a wonderful way of expression you know some people as a group of religious people so I went to Bangladesh I was travelling in a train and from dhaka to somewhere or from somewhere to dr. something I forgotten and it was a first-class compartment but still in a Bangladesh they are not that we developed so there are four seats were there in the one Cooper I was occupying one the one gentleman came I could see that a group big group his followers they also came and then they started discussing a modern themselves the way that the mail should be ruled by the woman or not that was the discussion as always it goes like that so I was not taking part at all because i am not in that group I went over there as a visitor so I was trying to look outside the window but they wanted to have my opinion and I was thinking whether it is necessary and where should i because the situation you can understand then suddenly that gentleman he told what they will say he is a Hindu and he worshipped a lady we standing on the chest of her husband mentioning the about the Kali so how they can't say anything about the women women should be always under the feet of the men so that was his thing ok that is the rupee then I don't that is correct that's why I am not commenting because our goddess his mother Kali we standing on the chest of the Shiba so here sree rama krishna is singing and he is telling I my mind is over them did wonder pondering the mothers mystery there's a mystery why the mother is it standing over there is she really a oh man or what is she so that discussions is a wonderful that's called Tantra then again he said the fear of the devotees flies away if they but seek the shelter at the feet of the Divine Mother was that why the master sang again following this song I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the mother these are all very famous Kali Krypton they sing as a collie particularly in Bengali and one great tan tantric he composed these songs very peculiarly in the tundra we find not that all the time all people they go to the cremation ground and see it and meditate on like that there are great personalities in the Tantra the only composed song and sang and then realized goddess so that is we will come to know afterwards in our retreat we will discuss that and this song is a very famous song is to sing oh boy body prana peachy Amy are icky jumeirah very catchy oh boy body prana peachy like the bowling of the original tune of the bengali song so it seems like that so i have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the mother and I am fearless now so sorry da now again he masked amateur giving an account and he was taken with the grief on account of his son's death so other is frame taken him to dakshina sure to visit the master sada was a devotee of sri chaitanya and serrano krishna looked at him and will inspired with the idea love go wrong now just this moment he was inspired in the cali dhaanto and this moment he is not in the totally inspired by the gauranga vaishnava in Hinduism there are three major path Sudhir Vedanta den bosch Nava and Tantra the bead on thur that follows the path of veda knowledge and bosh Nava the bhakti they say the Vishnu is the original and then the Tantra they are the followers of Shakti here he is singing about that go wrong but one thing we always noticed anyone coming to him with any problem see ramakrishna's to sing some songs mostly and these to be totally free from all anxieties and misery's that way he is singing there is not only the song but that was the prayer so that God's power is to that power invoked through that songs and then the master continued to sing assuming the attitude of you oh man devotees infatuated with the love of gauranga in the bhakti there are eight different ways that's called different eight of these and also the approaches to God were different one was as a lover so one is looking at the god as her lover and then continuing her spiritual progress and that is the way of Radhika is that in the Mishnah between 0 and here see Ramakrishna assuming that tire mentality temperament he is singing why do my neighbors raise such a scandal why do they cost and aspirations upon upon me simply because of gauranga because they go wrong now we know the chaitanya mahaprabhu as his he was very fair complex people is to call him gouranga the fear hunger the body so go wrong he's singing and then bolarum father was a never hence the master also saying of the divine love of the gopis for their beloved Krishna afterwards he fine Balaam's father he is giving and wonderful account of a person though very rich at the same time devoted but still not getting any spiritual upliftment why so Saddam o Krishna is giving the answer Balaam's father was a wealthy man with estates in different parts of the Orisha an orthodox member of the bush nieuwe sect he had built temples and arranged for distribution of food to the pilgrims at various holy places he had been spending last year of his life in Brindavan bushna verse for the most part had be got it in the religious views some of them harbour malicious feelings toward the followers of tantra and vedanta but see ramakrishna never encouraged such narrow outlook according to his teaching armistice and yearning all lovers of god will ultimately reach the same goal the master began the conversation in order to broaden the religious views of Balarama father very interestingly Balarama himself was a great devotee of ceramic ISNA balarama's father said Balarama also he was that time active jahmene de he was looking after all the property and he was a devotee of ceramic ish nuh very humble the bull Rambabu was very humble and that is why I Ramakrishna's to like him and see Ramakrishna visited that house more than hundred times we can understand how lucky the ballroom was but the ballrooms father though he used to follow all these things but in reality he was not doing to help him to go into the real part and realize God and get the peace Salam o Krishna tried many times whenever he met he always said this thing he said once I thought why should I be one sided therefore I was initiated into bushna vism in Brindavan and took the garb of a Vaishnav among the ceramic rishni is giving his I spent three days practicing the bush nabha discipline again at dakshina sure I was initiated into the mystery of Rama worship I painted my forehead with a long mark and put on a string with a dime on drowned my neck but after few days I get them up in the in the bush Nava always you have to have all the marks otherwise they will never accept you whether inside you were thinking about God or not that is not the question the bush never sect means you have to show that outwardly that you are a followers of which never sect in the rom I'd sampradaya those who are the followers of Rama Chandra they are also bish never because the Rama he is also than incarnation of Vishnu so the followers of Rama at the bush neighbors and they also follow this different type of dresses cinema Krishna said I also took like that but afterwards agra betta then he is giving a similarly a certain man had it up people would come to him to have their clothes died the top contained a solution of die whatever color a man wanted for his cloth he would get by dipping the plot in the top one man was amazed to see this and said to the dire please give me the dye you have in your top so this is a story that he is telling through this if you are having the love for God then whatever path you are following it doesn't matter you will reach to God sincerity and love for God yearning for God that is the only thing whatever path you are following a certain man had it up that is that he was telling was the master hinting that people professing different religions would come to him and have their spiritual consciousness awakened according to their own ideals Saddam o Krishna was the leaving parliament of religions he practiced all this and then he propagated also he saw Jesus Christ dear induction Asia and Jesus Christ came and embraced him and then vanished in his person he saw was earth mama he saw the Buddha and all these one after another that's why this is a specialty in cinema busines and with authority with confidence he could say all paths are leading to the same goal the only thing that you need is sincerity here I find that master to Bolam father don't read books anymore but you may read books on devotion such as the life of Chaitanya now when we are reading the book to naturally the story and whatever the writing all the impression is coming on the mind but a spiritual seeker particularly when there is not much time left in the life is better to read those books which will help me to proceed as balram's father he was a devotee the Serrano krishna is guiding him you must read the devotional book maybe the life of Sri Chaitanya the whole thing is to love God and taste a sweetness in the land human life if we don't get the taste of that God's love it is the wastage we are trying so hard we are given up so much but still we couldn't feel anything that narrowness that jealousy that ego everything is there but years together we are attending the churches and sermons what is the fun in that so see ramakrishna is very practical then you must get it so he said the whole thing is to love God and taste his sweetness he sweetness and the devotee is its enjoyer the devotee drinks the sweet breeze of God further God is the Lotus and the devotee the be the devotee seeps the honey of the lotus again as a devotee cannot live without God so God cannot live without his devotee then the devotee becomes the sweetness and the god its enjoyer the devotee becomes the loaders and God the be it is the Godhead that has become this tool in order to enjoy its own blaze in this line ceramic is telling the divider two and two there is a devotee and a God and because the devotees devotion God has become the Lotus at the flower and devotee that be enjoying and then again the devotee itself become the Lotus God is coming to the devotee and enjoying then immediately so that we should not miss understand we should not take it so seriously that God is different and devotees are different he said Godhead that has become this to with the devotee and with the god same thing now just because of that that is the baton to advaita the god has become everything in order to enjoy its own please that is the significance of the episode of Radha and Krishna when you read about the rather hand Krishna when you see the pictures when he see the movies based on that they depict in a totally different way who was rather Krishna himself and Krishna also was that other other was the Krishna so that is the idea so that devotee and the God are not separate they're all same ruin the not he wrote a wonderful that those who can understand Bengali they can enjoy tie tomorrow Anand o amar poor to meet is a Chunichi am I knowingly three Veuve on a shore to mark promote Oh Jamie Chi it would have been the falls hence you have come down on the art to me the devotee though you are the lord of three worlds sharjah Martha and potala still without me whom you could show your love the devotee is so important salam o Krishna is telling that Balarama so you are also so important so obviously you are part and parcel of God the why should you always be so scared of God the love of God is necessary and that love with this feeling advaitha now salam o Krishna is giving the instruction at the beginning of spiritual life devotee should observe such rights as pilgrimage putting a string of beads around his neck like the bush neighbors they do and so forth but outward ceremonies gradually drop off as he attains the goal the vision of God what is the goal vision of God then his only activity is the repetition of God's name and contemplation and meditation on him now when we are beginning when a young boy is going to attend the school and he is carrying so much of books and then the bus is coming getting down the Tiffin box water bottle friends and so many other things are going on on and on and thus when the same person has received the knowledge now he is giving that knowledge to others you don't need all those things it's not necessary to all the time to go and follow all the curriculums of the school so that is the idea when a devotee is coming to God we are beginning with all these rituals and the disciplines then slowly we are developing what the love for God why I can love God because i am god i am loving myself so otherwise we are loving ourselves so I identify this body as I that is the problem when I can realize that soul that is within me as I I can see that the same soul everywhere ceramic ISNA will give that idea then ceramic ISNA is giving again the analogy the pain is equivalent to 16 rupees makes a great heap but 16 silver coins do not look like such a big amount again the quantity becomes much smaller when you change the 16 rupees into one gold mehar and if you change the gold into tiny piece of diamond people hardly notice it see that way he is describing when we start we start with the temple and then these and that and that and that so many things then slowly slowly one thing comes within the mind constant flow of God's holy name and the joy out of that so that is the idea one should develop that cinema Krishna that is why it is his speciality he never goes on giving all the outs are outward expressions of religion or their religion is having these having that having that when we will study the Tantra you will find so many Jogi knees so many mother the Divine Mother so many the Yamaha that is another way this jamala is telling the bead about the so many names and so many other things if you go down in the way our in our one picture is there so many gods and goddesses everyone is giving so some idea so if you that I think in one Sunday a group of students are coming from a church from Chicago they wants to learn about the Hinduism now what is Hinduism it all this so many so many so many is impossible to remember but then it comes to only one point I am God that's all so that idea when it comes people hardly notice it Sosa Ramakrishna this wonderful way he is giving this Orthodox boyish nawaz insist on the outer insignia of religion they criticize any devotee who does not wear these marks was that why the master said that after the vision of God a devotee becomes indifferent to outer marks giving up formal worship when the goal of spiritual life is attained I read one book there's a in Muslim saints rabia she was a lady and she is to serve her master then something happened and they were not that way respectful to the women and this to think the women is not having the soul that is a man is having the woman's are just like the inner things like the wood or stone or like that so when they were taking food they saw there's one born and they were wondering whether the human bone is also same like that so why not see the Ark's rabia and then asked her to lie on the table and they just opened her League you can imagine the terrible pain and they were all like this Exeter or then again Oxford to take away and he she was thrown in a small room rabia instead of crime she was praying to God God you have given this body and in those forms of those people you wanted to give me pain you just for the fun of it so now you please forgive me and give me your darshan and she was going on praying praying and praying one day the master he was passing through that room hard rabia is praying to Allah the God that the master is innocent he never knew that I have a life I feel pain I am a human being so innocently he did this please forgive him the Masters mind changed then he gave her the freedom she was a bonded labor now the freedom she got she went inside the desert as a small hardship erected and started meditating praying then the people who is to pass through that this to give him lot of food and respect slowly slowly everywhere they came to know about rabia and she started drawing lot of attentions and respect from the ordinary people then a group of religious people so-called religious immediately they felt oh they are not respecting us but they are going to rub yeah but she is not recognized so let us go and challenge her they all came and told rabia as per the customers but the system before praying to God you are supposed to criticize the devil the site on do you do that the Ravi has answered that is why all the story just what this answer she told I don't have any time to criticize that they real so this is the wonderful idea that we always find so I hear they say the God is everything and everything is in God in English they call it pantheism all is God and pan in theism all in God all is God all in God so when one see the all is God so that is the idea of the bed anthem and again when a devotee is seeing everything that we see in the outside world it is inside the god only nothing outside so that is the two different views but the same thing the master he was telling Caravaggio group of the devotees in the cart abuja group say the devotees into four classes cart abuja most of us we do not know them but that time it was a very famous way of spiritual practice kartha means the God kartha means the master and who is the master the God and all these people they are following the mountain master the god now as because that we cannot see the god so the in charge of the person he was considered as the Carta and the people is to come but they were not having good names and their acceptance in the society but Saddam o Krishna wherever there is anything good always is to pick it up and then give it to the devotees he said they actually made the four different type of devotees one prabharaka the prabharaka Sedaka cydia cedars cydia pervert ekkada beginner prabharaka and that is called beginner he puts the mark of his religion on his forehead where's the string beads around his neck observe the other outer conventions all this is Robert acha is the beginner then the sadaqa the struggling devotee does not care so much for elaborate rights an example of the class is the bowel in the Bengal there is a group of people they always see the god in all beings and particularly in the body so all they pray to God not in a temple they don't have any temple and they constantly move from one place to another and go on singing praising the God and the particular attention is giving on the body that is called ba all this bound group they don't care about the external marks and all the that the perfect firmly believes that God exists the sheet of the schita the supremely perfect like Chaitanya not only has realized God but also has become intimate with him talks with him all the time this is the last limit of realization so mostly we see the beginning and that's why in all religion when the people are going over there we see in the churches you have to put on this type of dress if to go over there and then you have to behave like this it like they stand like this and you have to go and do this all this paraphernalia and in the Hinduism there is almost everywhere all these things at the end and in the Islam also you have to go and then wash your hand up to the complete hand and then the neck and these you have to go and sit in this particular fashion facing this particular site and all are there now after the realization of God where is God God is everywhere when the God is everywhere why should I have to sit in this particular position and pray so that is the main question so I we have to reach up to that situation not that just anyone don't believe in god those l don't care whether the God exists or not not like that they are believers and this is a realization and then how we will understand the disbelievers and the believer the love respect affection and all the good human qualities that will manifest in a believer in a devotee so otherwise everybody is is so and so many people out there they say I don't believe in God and they don't care with which side is the God who won boy I found him lying down over here putting the leg towards taco then I said you what you are doing I am receiving the blessings of God and the god will bless on your head y con the league so turn round and put the leg that side and hey to God so God is placed on your head not to your leg so he ever realized it and that's true there then he turned it so that way only they are thinking God will give the blessings on the head nothing wrong it goes in this way and slowly slowly slowly we develop now previously the Hindu will never visit any other thing other churches or the mosque and all others and still now many people the sooner you minded they think we should come only to our church or mosque or synagogue or the temple we own we should not go anywhere else there is narrowness God is everywhere wherever the people are gathering together and praying for the God thinking of higher level there the manifestation of God is there and what is that God is the all Summum bonum of all good qualities summum bonum of all good qualities a god and that can be said in one word l.o.v.e without any discrimination and in the teachings of sri ramakrishna be fine again and again there are many kinds of spiritual aspirants those endowed with satwa perform their spiritual practices secretly they look like ordinary people but they meditate inside the mosquito net now the meditation what is the meditation not that constantly you have to see it and close your eyes meditation means 1.8 thought one flow of thought so that is called meditation whether i am driving whether i'm working whether i am talking with people or i am sitting and concentrating my mind My Mind's flow only in one direction that is called meditation and this type of people are SWAT think so at the guna we know the very good quality then as parents endowed with Rajas exhibit outward pump a ring of beads around the neck a mark on the forehead and oka robe a silk cloth a rosary with all gold beads and so on they are like stall keepers advertising their wares and signboards Sri Ramakrishna is not at all happy with these people and the third grade Thomas acha is not talking about because there you cannot consider them and then salam o Krishna is giving this 3 all religions and all paths call upon their followers to pray to one and the same God look at it one and the same God one God only la illaha illa llah ha that is the Muslim to say there is no 2 there is only one Allah here in the Christianity also the same there is only one God it cannot be to Hindus also considering only one God not so many so this way when we see they age all paths and all religions all faiths the teaching that there is only one God they are therefore one should not show disrespect to any religion or religious opinion now it is slowly people are opening up there is a group of people they go everywhere they are mission one gentleman from South Korea he has formed this group and they mainly the ladies from that part of the country they are here in America they go to different cities of America they organize meetings called different type of people and they give their Christians and they give one subject to discuss from different point of view the scene from the different point of view or the god different point of view and this way that way but they always try to bring all different religious groups to express their views sitting together on the same table and to exchange their views not fighting trying to understand each other so this is called therefore one should not show disrespect to any religion or religious opinion this is the modern age and ceramic ISNA he has given this flow flow of thought and now it is touching percolating each and every one of the society there are accepting it it is impossible a few years before to think in this way even even today in India some of the parts are there where a bush never cannot think to go to Kali temple or the Collies are the curs think to visit any Bush Naboo temple they will never that is the narrowness and Saddam o Krishna is breaking it and he said it is God alone who is called sachidananda brahman in the Vedas the bather they call the goal as Brahman and in the Puranas those who are followers of the Vishnu sachidananda Krishna and again sachidananda Shiva in the Tundra's it is one and the same shot cheat on and Seth cheat Ananda and these are three words that is giving the complete definition of the real truth what is its earth existence cheat there's the knowledge and then under the blaze and we are all that particular Brahman or Krishna or Shiva so that's why Sammy we become the said service to Manny service to God service to man is service to God why how could he say that emotion emotional statement no it is not an emotional statement the statement of the realization each and every in the tundra we'd find they say Kuhn Tucker there's a terminology the Chaka means as in the bed antha they say Maya and we are bewildered we are all under that what is not true we think that is true what is not permanent we always accepted as permanent what is unhappiness we always think that is happiness for me and you always suffer always suffer and they say remove that ego that is covered with Maya and you see that you are the Shiba and in the tundra they say kuhn-tucker there five and the same way if you remove those things from your mind you are the Shiba the jiva that means the individual being is Sheba the all-pervading God Sosa Ramakrishna said the Shiva in the tantric away there are different six of which neighbors that which is called that Brahman in the Vedas is called Alec niranjan bushna bisect Alec niranjan is one of the bush never sect Alec means that which cannot be pointed out or perceived by the Saints organs are lekha alayka you cannot express about it you cannot perceive it with this five sense organs the I the nose the here the touch and all so that is called Alec niranjan on Jenna under means the different type of desires and when there is no desire free from the desire so that is called niranjana according to according to this sect Radha and Krishna are only two bubbles of the Alec according to be danta there is no incarnation of God Vedanta means Advaita Vedanta no incarnation of God the Vedanta say Rama Krishna are about two waves in the ocean of sachidananda in reality there are they are not to there is only one a man may call on God by any name if he is sincere in his player he will certainly reach him he will succeed if he is longing that is the most important teaching and there is a a colaba in the Mahabharata there is a story young boy he wanted to learn the archery from a guru but guru understood this boy is very talented and he'll be a parallel to Arjuna so to give the arjuna the space he told no i cannot teach you because you are not kshatriya or not brahmana so of the forecast the upper to cast brahmana and kshatriya they will get the opportunity to learn from me and not you what he did he loved the teacher so much he went inside inside the jungle and then he made an image of that gentleman the Guru and he learned himself and one day when they came to the jungle for hunting they found that boy as a master Archer we're from you have to learn from you sir but I don't see you but here you are the image he kept the image and he went on believing this is the image which is teaching me so whatever the teachings came within his mind he learned he learned and learned he became the master so that is called the faith when we are worshipping a small piece of stone thinking that that is the embodiment of the Vishnu naran Sheila or the trip Sheba or the Durga that faith takes us to that realization that is exactly what see Ramakrishna is telling and he'd say that they make so many pilgrims and repeat the name of God so much now he is pointing out to the father of Valor ambush Robert was his great devotee as a great supporter too he used to give all the provisions and the money but the Solano krishna was completely free not that you have to go on telling the rich man so just comforting him so that he should not be angry should not go away not like that he said what is good for them and that is the teachers character a teacher real teacher should not hesitate to tell or to speak out what is good for the disciple so volumes father was a good man but he was not understanding the truth Sosa Ramakrishna with these words he is telling they make so many pilgrimages and repeat the name of God so much but why do they not realize anything it is because they have no longing for God God reveals himself to the devotees if only he calls upon him with a longing heart the jesus also that famous story there he pushed down the head of the boy the gentleman who wanted to know how to call him God he pushed down his eight under the water and till he was almost dying then he left and this man came out he asked how you were longing for air oxygen similarly if you long for God without you oh god I'm dying I cannot take breathe without you dad love then only you can realize and cinema Krishna I was going on at the beginning of the yatra performance the he is giving an example again whenever he says something immediately he gives the example in the yatra I don't know whether you have seen or not in the villages Heather the open-air performances in the beginning just to make the people aware that something is going to happen there will be lot of light and singing and drum beating and the people will come and dance all these things on the people will come o the jatra is going to start when all they are attentive they are looking at it immediately those people will go Nora the will enter and the Narada or a person who will go on telling about the truth see if you are not following these you are going to suffer so that way all over India every village these to spread the high moral values and this way there's to spread not that people where they were able to read and they had no time to go and listen to the Sun months but through the yatras through this dramas they learn then it was Tuesday October sixteen eighteen eighty-three ceramic ISNA was in his room at dakshin Asia with Raquel again Bala roms father then Bonnie Paul M the master Michelle Money Malik ish on key sherry and other devotees master masha has given all these names why because the account the record and all the conversation that he has published those people that time they were alive so naturally they could protest oh no you have written in or one way I was never there or I didn't talk in that way or the master never said these you have added you know that is the historicity that is the specialty of this gospel and we will find that the master ceramic richness just this would one or two sentences liberal-minded devotees accept all the forms of God is it wonderful the two sentences first he said liberal-minded devotees accept all the forms of god krishna cali Siva Rama and so on then the ballrooms father yes sir immediately see Ramakrishna he understood that he has not understood understood the Valerians father couldn't get the right point immediately he said the next sentence but again there is a thing called mr. single-minded devotion so that is called nishtar so I have chosen an idol and this I chill i am going on practicing ideal that is very very important some people they come and ask what is initiation accepting an ideal hydrology the ceramic ishness ideology and that if you are accepting you are accepting the initiation of ceramic ISNA so that is called that way one should go next day we will read from here the broad minded accepting everyone at the same time for the personal spiritual development one should be one pointed and ceramic ISNA is giving the example of the gopis you will read in our next class let us chanted mantra need an genom nityam ananta rupam popped on compa Drita Bikram be ye shabe taram para Misha medium-term ramakrishna shear asana mamu Shanti shaundi shawndie hurry you that set three Ramakrishna her eponymous to
