[12. Panchama Veda 12: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy32Zm5PH-0)

so let us begin foreign we are reading the gospel of sri ramakrishna and the last when we were starting this one we found that the sinful words bakya dosha we have to be careful about that that these are the paths of towards spirituality we are moving towards the spirituality towards god we like to realize god and before that all these things are necessary what is the sinful words they say that means harsh words so we discussed last time that one should not behave like that should not use this type of words second false words on ritambakya one should not use the false words thirdly means criticism one should not use those words by which we are criticizing others and finally on related discussion awesome it's not bhakya prala there's no meaning why we are discussing like that so we last time i discussed how people the most of the time they'll be spending on gossip they will be spending on unnecessary discussion and that way the time is lost and then we discussed about purity the moment we are thinking about the purity it comes only as if we are taking the ganga water drinking little ganga water or doing little japan this is purity of course this is purity but purity goes in three different stages jesus said blessed are those who are pure in heart for they shall see god if one wants to see god realize god then how what type of purity then it says and this way we are understanding very core of the things because all this in a superficial way we know but the purity means first gross purity stula prosperity means not speaking telling lies or this that that way just body and mind that purity and that is that also so difficult for us even that we cannot practice and we expect that we will realize god second is subtle purity inside the mind subconscious mind also should be pure there should not be any impure thought when those who have read the life of sri ramakrishna then he has mentioned many times even in dream the worldly thoughts never came to me it is so pure even in dream the worldly thoughts never came and purity means always thinking of god and god means all pervading consciousness and when that all-purpose pervading consciousness constantly within our mind within our consciousness within our thought what happens we always feel so much for others love for others concern for others there will not be any averta any small dot of jealousy of criticism of narrow thoughts nothing will be there so subtle mind also and then that won't do ultimately we have to go to the causal purity karna pavitra in the root itself it will not come and once our system debated european lady swami our scientist because the scientist was presenting a paper so swamiji asked her to help the scientist and she was doing and she stayed back in the paris for a long time jagadish chandra bhosh the scientist when afterwards she was not coming and then swamiji wrote to her why you are not coming there's a lot of work is there now the paper is already ready and give it to him and come back and join in the work jokingly she said are you jealous as because i am with the jagadish chandra bush swamiji replied that is one thing completely absent from my birth now jala say nothing can you imagine the causal purity swami vivekananda when he was traveling in the cairo streets of cairo the devotees who were with him they were also not knowing properly about the city so they went to a place which was not very good all the ladies were standing over there gesturing question immediately those they understood their mistakes they have strategy to come back swamiji come back but swamiji totally in a different mood he went near to them and martyring telling to himself oh my mothers where you have brought you or in this place as if sorry lokai saying he was telling to himself and the effect was the whole hell turned into heaven that very moment all of the many of them could not bear that vivekananda in their front so there anyway some of them closed their eyes and were shouting god god and a few those who were little pure they came and they touched the feet of swamiji crying to save their souls so that is the power of purity that is the power of love so this is what we have to learn and we were reading that yoga says the mind of a person is very the master of the world when we are proceeding towards god realization spirituality we read a lot of books you go to many places they will be simply chanting they have mocked up we were discussing that previously people were there who who could recite the whole four vedas that's why their title were chaturvedi surname was chaturvedi they were supposed to recite all the four vedas but does it mean they were religious people realized people holy people no we have to see where their mind was what when you are performing physically that is not the work that is not the turn what we are thinking that is the work and that impression we will carry not physically what we are doing it is nothing sometimes people will be always careful that we are not uh stumble on or stepping on the uh say and such that type of things very very careful they'll be carrying the broom in their hands sweeping all the way and putting their feet like that ahimsha is it ancient physically doing can we do practice on himself that way and the same person will be criticizing others planning to harming others or behaving in a totally different way so that is the reason we have to understand the scripture perfectly otherwise we cannot make progress we are thinking that we are progressing that is also another difficulty when be studying the uh yoga philosophy and every sunday morning there we will come to know about this we make our whole world like that we start thinking he is mentioning in the village and the daughter-in-law is so silent but the mother-in-law right from the morning till night she'll be shouting and cursing now the people they could hear her and could see her because she was on the first floor and from there she will be looking on the ground and will be going on criticizing the the daughter-in-law and like this everybody used to think see the mother-in-law is so good sister daughter-in-law is so good i'm sorry and she never says anything but look at this old lady senior lady instead of loving her she is constantly criticizing her rebuking her and using the bad languages but one young boy he thought they never action and the reaction it is obvious there must be two things together then only sound will come in one in one hand you cannot clap you have to have two hands so then he climbed a tree and from there he found that that young lady that the daughter-in-law she is sweeping the coat here and sometimes looking at the mother-in-law that dad is sitting over there in the parantha and showing that room to her and then again quietly she is doing it and this lady will be angry and going on amusing and shouting and this will continue and when she is tired quiet and down again she silently we are doing not doing anything physically there also that lady was doing physically showing the broom no sometimes we are so quiet so good so loving always smiling for us but sometimes these people will be so dangerous because their thought is dangerous because their thought process is totally very dangerous time so this is the one person is angry then again he is laughing and then again normally behaving is a normal person it's okay you can understand but always angry difficult and always smiling be away because we do not understand what he is thinking so that is the manohar so mind is the doer through thought not the body through action body is nothing just like our machine what we think the body does body has nothing to do why again and again we are discussing about the mind because that is very important for us and bhagavan sinan krishna is telling that how to realize god then he said then we will come to because this is our mind which can immediately give us mukti freedom and this mind is the cause of our bondage this is the reason again and again we have to understand but don't keep your mind over there you are free those who are poor people standing over there homeless asking for food asking for help because they are not having any property not having a new world not having bank account not at all they are at just more at first but there will be many people under dust having lot of money respect social acceptance was totally detached but that is one minister he was coming sitting on it on an elephant and the disciple of caitanya caitanya asked him to go and meet him he went to the this is the man caitanya asked me to meet he is a bishoe he's a minister so many people surrounding him and naturally his mind was not oh this is not a good person but when he talked about caitanya mahaprabhu about the god he started crying tears rolled down so much of love only one word immediately broke the whole thing his mind was so pure so devoted so concentrated on that holy ideology so this is the same is explaining this thing in a very beautiful way we will come across again and again afterwards he's telling about two frames both of them are walking and suddenly one form that there is a temple artha is going on and music devotional music is going on he said let me go but let us go over there and the other friend said here all old people only goes we are young people why should you go over here let us go to some other place i will show you you see the music you see the dance you will see that they are distributing the wine freely there are so many things that they have come with me i said no i'll go over here he went and sat then the one person was reading the bhagavata and perhaps i don't know i added it perhaps he was reading the bhagavat and krishna and all these things are going on and this fellow got bored oh my god where i've come it's so boring maybe the reader and the speaker was like me so making everybody bored and he was thinking it would have been better if i would come with my friend over there he's enjoying so he's sitting in the temple and thinking about the protherm and the person over there was lamenting in his mind oh my god what the hell i mean why have i come over here so fill the things everywhere so all the the way they are dancing and talking and singing so nasty and why i am here i could go over there with my temple he must be listening to the holy words to the holy songs the both of them they were thinking their body was one's body was in a filthy place another was in a holy place but the mind was just opposite when they died the one who was sitting physically in the brothel went to god heaven and the other went to hell then they were wondering why i was in temple only then they said but you your body was in the temple but what you were thinking and that is the reason that rani rashmani she was sitting in front of the goddess kali and was thinking something else about his property she was a queen devotional song and he could understand the mind of the people immediately gave a slap and it was unthinkable a priest is slapping the queen rani rashmani and her personality we cannot imagine when you read the biography life of that that running but rani understood because the touch of sudama krishna transformed the heart it was not an ordinary touch so here we find that the mind is the thing that we have to be very very careful others won't be able to understand me from outside how one can understand the mind only people like salaam krishna came i told you perhaps the one gentleman came and said and he was looking at me that i told do you have to say something he is looking then afterwards again i i do like to say something third time when i asked he said you know what i like to say i don't have time to read your mind you now tell me what you want to say and save the time of you and me also so if you are thinking the moment you reach over there they will be understanding this all miraculous thing doesn't happen all the time very very few people like krishna vivekananda masha are the very high spiritual people they can understand perhaps but mostly they will never use it and here we find that sri mah is asking some questions about god in for or without form that conversation is going on in the beginning we've known and what was the answer of krishna god may be informed maybe without form whatever you like you stick to that suppose you are liking that god without form no stick to that but never think this is the only path this is the only way this is the only method that is the teaching of surroundings we are recapitulating that is the only thing what i am thinking it is good is correct correct for me but what they are thinking that to a god and good and that is for them then the question of how to fix our mind on god and then he said sirama krishna that important point he is telling you have to break the ego that is important the answer god is giving the answer that's true the holy person giving the answer that's true but who is listening suppose he have the having the ego you won't listen properly that's why sometimes we go to the doctors unless you can love the doctor you that medicine may not work it's because of the psychology oh this person doesn't look that smart like a doctor will he be able to help me i don't think so like that it will be difficult even for the teachers also if we are not having the sartar we cannot learn from the teacher properly so that is why this word afterwards we will come to that but the before that our ego should be removed no i have come over here and he is a holy person he has given his life the whole life of this purpose can i be compared with him no and all through the life he has practiced this not done and committed any mistake then why not we listen to him maybe his explanation is just moment this moment i am not liking because i am not understanding and suramar krsna's explanation was not liked by more srimad master marshall mahindra when he said both he was all right with form was thinking how it is possible the how one thing can be informed and without form when the without form is everywhere the same everywhere god how it so this and afterwards again and again sri master masha's ego was broken by that is very important before we are listening to the holy words we have to understand this when shri ma was confused about whether god has a form or god without form siram krishna sort remember that god with form is just as true as god we doubt for look at the way he is telling as true that has without form then he said this is very important but hold fast to your own conviction suppose i am today morning i am a devotee i am thinking god is there i am here and afternoon i'm a gyani i don't believe in the form of god that would do that will not help us the other day i think day before yesterday we were in a place i was talking about the one gentleman said that god is everywhere then why should i pray why should i have to ask i said that is for you if you really think that god is everywhere and god is within you and you are the god good for that but you have to take the whole responsibility when it is good everybody is praising i am when everybody is criticizing oh god god that woman your all the blame to god and all the praise to yourself i don't do that's why he is telling but hold fast to your own conviction why that is the way we can go towards spirituality the same thing sorry we find in the tantra explaining almost the same in a way he's telling advaita dwell dwell team advaita engaged in each and every sun like advaita one only tweeted you cannot fathom you cannot understand the total god that's why again and again bhagavan is telling don't try to understand the whole of it it is impossible even the sukadeva could take a little water out of that infinite ocean so whatever you are thinking it is good that's good for you in come bengali take mango why you are calculating all the leaves of the tree first who is the owner then how many branches how many leaves what for you need the mango you take the mango be satisfied it is not possible for us to understand god is impossible one part and this same way again we find that daksa is telling beyond so these are the wonderful way we find and bhagavatam krishna he is explaining the whole thing in a very unimaginable way in his own the special way he said mother cooks different dishes to shoot the stomachs of a different children the different type of people are there so according to their taste they'll be myself and vardhan and the jewish side by saying having lot of what's called peanut butter and all those things will be there i'll be just glancing but i can't take so and what i am taking if i offer also you'll say thank you this is all peter and without wire so naturally mother cooks different dishes to shoot the stomachs of a different children see how simple way he is solving the whole problem everybody is shouting my way path my thought my ideology my philosophy is correct yours and not only they won't stop over there my philosophy is correct it's okay they won't stop yours is not that it also says this is the problem but some people may think why when we are reading siram krishna and when siram krishna is telling it is sufficient why should we have to quote from different scriptures why should we have to make all these explanations about the words of krishna which is so simple so this is the question it may come in the minds of some people you just read which is so easy is it is it so easy to understand one brahmacharya one gentleman you can say he was reading kathamrta and he said to a swami senior swami nowadays i am reading saying don't read you first read the complete works of swami vivekananda you are so simple so easy but so difficult to understand because as if we have understood you but next moment if i know so so depth and moreover the this is the tradition of india whenever we are going to establish something telling something immediately you will find even the shankaracharya in his explanations in his commentary he'll be quoting from different philosophy can be quoting from different persons why shankaracharya is sufficiently knowledgeable whatever he says is sufficient no he will be quoting giving the argument giving the answer so that whatever he wants to establish that is perfect so this one when our arjuna he understood that the person whom with whom he was mixing as a frame rooming around and all these things he's not ordinary he's the god himself and then he said your you were the supreme brahman you were the supreme abode and you were the utterly holy person then the second sentence is wonderful why because all the rishis are ghostworld survey these things have been said about you it has been mentioned by all the rishis and what type of rishis and you have also said to me you yourself have said about you to me so this is also essential some necessary sometimes some people will be telling why you quote about this man and that man they are giving about the statement about krishna is it essential necessary for this only this necessary all those people who are talking and then for the historical uh the events also historically you have to prove you have to keep this sentence so this is very very important this is important because all the scriptures have thought in the same way and nothing new and once the truth has come it may not be difficult it cannot be different truths same truth realized by different people different time different places and expressing in different language but it is the same truth that is the way that is why we are quoting so much from different sastras and here we find he repeats the god's name and sing his glory and the first questions that he asked and how to fix our mind on god repeat the gods and we have discussed a claim how to take the name of god it's called japan in sanskrit the only jabba onto only the name on do you have to at the same time remember the glory of god singing the glory of god that means his qualities what is what is the quality of god first and foremost purity simplicity and love eternal love love for everyone and purity means unselfishness the moment we are selfish we are impure and the moment we are utterly unselfish we become god ourselves and that is why we have then visiting the gods devotees and holy men have you noticed how he is mentioning visiting the devotees now he has not mentioned that devotee means devoted devoted for many reasons devoted for many things when one of the very famous spiritual person person died passed away the supreme court had to give the judgment close the door otherwise his devotees the devotees then the word devotee within court they all came and they were taking away all the gold and wealth and money these are the devotees they understand this man is having a lot of money and so they will be there swamping and then the moment he passed away all jump over there all the committee members have become so rich why they are devotee i have 25 years standing devotee so i want 25 percent of the wealth so this type of devotees are also there and majority of them are like that only the moment they won't get the profit they will never come to are the gods devoted that is the question oh maharaja is a very and devotee right from 1952 it's good but he's truly it's not the age it's not the year it's not from whom you have taken the initiation but you have to understand and with truly god's devotee bhagavan sirama krishna using this word visit god's devotee and who can be a god's devotee totally devoted whose mind is totally to god there's no discrimination and just like the holy person same thing whose mind is always dwelling at the feet of god is a holy person is a devotee so this way unless we know it's of no use then many people will be coming and quoting that he was there that was that the relation and all is good but not that his uncle was a sannyasi so he is also almost like sunnis you know it's nothing like that the question of it just because he he's going to the asthma spending time with the monks or helping this thing on that thing with in the astra does it mean the devotee no you have to understand it so devotees company that will rise you from the worldly temperament to the spiritual temperament so the company or the thought of the person to whom i am going must be like that also so these are the things we must be very very careful otherwise what happens in the spiritual life we cannot make any progress and go to solitude now and then and discriminate he is telling discriminate bichar every month in at our ganges michigan we are having the spiritual retreat the very learned swamis they are coming they are expounding as simple as possible way they are telling the whole day but are you really utilizing the time we go over there we are happy to some extent is good but when sudama krishna is advising to be in the solute means with the thought we are going over there that must be 100 that two days or three days thinking nothing but god the group of ladies they were going on food to a pilgrimage and they were taking all the things for to offer the god but never talked about god they were talking about something else this is the way sirama krishna is explaining these people are going to the temple but never talked about the god they'll be talking about oh my niece all that he is so close to me you won't leave me like that all the words of samsara they'll be talking and she's just like mother so careful about the development of the devotees again and again pinpointing it again and again explaining it not to criticize but to rectify it it's not the criticism it's the rectification whole life we are spending in the asthma without any development i told our teachers i told our staff when you were very young came and joined in the astronaut and back in our customers there in india and when you retired the age of 16 when you go back with what you are going back only some pension money only some other things don't you think that you are spending your whole life in the holy companion in a holy place all these people they are coming from far away places only to talk to us they are coming and spending 10 minutes 15 minutes half an hour they are so happy and we are here all true with you you are not taking the benefit of it do you think you are really very clever this way also the past you have seen hundreds they will never think about that we are holy people they will never think that this is an asthma they will never think that they can develop in spirituality along with their work and all through they'll be thinking that they are not getting the proper benefit and if you ask them to speak about any religious thing spirituality and they will be towers together in a wonderful sentences they will be talking about god and all this but in practice nothing so it is not the place that you are living but it is the practice that you are doing this is very important we are going to the solution but what we are thinking there what type of talk what type of thought so this is when you go to the solitude he is asking where to go and there you have to be lonely alone how can you be lonely because in one room with two different people or three different accommodation it doesn't mean anything you're three but you're lonely when you are traveling suppose in our train or in a uh aircraft so many people are there we are all lonely there may be hundreds but i am thinking in my oh i'm just deep in my own thought i am reading i am thinking i am meditating i am praying will anybody will come and disturb me no nobody will come rather your that behavior will inspire others so this is the important thing but most of the time we never point it out why so we don't like to be disliked by you and that is wrong so if we are really loving the devotees we have to pinpoint or to tell them that this is the wrong thing that you are doing you should not so this is and afterwards we find we discuss also the ninja portion what is practicing silence and what is mawna etc now there are three different types of mentalities are there in reply how ought we to live in the world when master mushai asks the wonderful answer he gave most of the time the philosophy is telling that this world is illusory full of sorrow so just leave it and come away wrong thing wrong for whom person who is receiving it here there are three different types of mentality one they want to enjoy the world now obviously for them if you are pressurizing them socially asking them to leave the everything and come away what they will do either they will become man or they will behave in a way and two faces will be there apparently they will be showing that they are holy and they'll be behaving in other way and so many instances nowadays will find because of that and second mentally detached people and these people they don't like to be in the world so they completely dedicated to god and spirituality so this is also all right but the answer that bhagavan sram krishna gave it is for the third type of people who are they they are majority and they are they understood the futility of this world the life is is nothing is going to pass away someday and i'll be like this and that that they have understood but at the same time they can't leave the worldly life immediately to and totally because they have some responsibility like the master mahashaya do all your duties but keep your mind on god see the answer so simple but so valuable this is the first time someone is telling like this do all your duties but keep your mind on god leave it all with your wife and children father mother serve them treat them as if they were very dear to you but know in your heart of hearts that they do not belong to you why cerama krishna is asking like this i love them so much respect them so much i touched them attached with them so much today in newspaper i was reading to one person now he is 65 years old and somehow he has become a father and he's so happy the whole four pages of the newspaper they have dedicated on him only in 65 he has become father he's so happy exit to exit these are the first type of people they never think but they're good people very efficient people but not very careful about spiritual life not that they are not religious they are also religious people maybe they are going to the temple and churches and all this they are doing but they are not the people to listen to the krishna and those who have already renounced the word there is also another type of people but this is the people for whom some sri lanka is telling they live in the society live in the family but you have to live this is the truth that he is telling if you can live in that way you will be happy ultimately because ultimately we have to leave the more we hug and more we clings to these people we cannot keep ourselves and they also cannot be with us we came alone we have to go along if this truth is there in our mind then only we can love god and then he is giving the udharan the means is giving the instances and that's it made servant in the house then the tortoise moves about in the water but can you guess where our thoughts are that they are on the bank where our eggs are lying in andaman we saw huge tortoise they're coming and they usually swim from australia to andaman they live in australia but when they give the a they swim across the whole ocean go to the shore of india and then they will go up deep and lay the egg close the whole thing and go in the water i don't know why thousands of people they will be coming mostly from the euro of america america and with all camera all over night they'll be lying over there to have the photograph and glimpses like this and this is prakriti this nature i can't explain but the thing is their mind is always there that will be where their eggs are maybe they won't find it again but the mind is there so similarly we have to keep our mind on god then mixing with all these people and he is telling if you enter the world without fast cultivating love for god you will be entangled more and that more a story so one dog was there and constantly it will be lying at the gate the the people that are living in the house they never liked the dog they used to beat the dog they used to try to push it away they never fade but dog will never go then suddenly one holy man came who could see them but through and through he saw that there's not a dog there's a person with him then he talked with that who are you why you are here then he said i am actually the owner of this house all these people are my grandchildren and their children they're all my relatives i love this family so much that i cannot leave them so first i came as a cow then after that death of my cow body i have taken the form of a dog am lying over here but they don't understand they beat me and i am guarding them so much attachment then this holy person said they will be taken care of they they know how to take care of themselves you take the name of god and be free from this bondage so this is the company of evoli man how they slowly develop there was a dog he used to leave with swami vivekananda in bellurmont you have raid above that dog even when the swamiji said leaving on the other side of the bank of the ganga he came away and again he was there after the dead body then somewhere they placed the dead body but found that the dead body is floating just in front of the bed maybe sometimes so this is the way we cannot explain but there are so many things are there so one must be very very careful about the attachment we love the household we love our children we must do that but not with attachment that is what is telling you will be overwhelmed with its danger its grief its sorrows and the more you think of worldly things the more you will be attached to them then he is giving how we can be free from all this he is giving that update the instruction very simple first rub your hands with oil and then bring open the jackfruit which usually in the villages the ladies they do first they will be applying the oil in their fingers and hand and then they will break open the jackfruits but the green jackfruits particularly first secure the oil of divine love see the word he is using the oil of divine love and then set your hands to the duties of the world then he say but one must go in to salute you to attain the divine love he is telling that when you are living in the world you use the divine love as an oil so that you are not attached with the word and when we develop that where we will get the divine love he is also telling that you have to go to the solitude to get barter from milk you must let it set into curd and into a secluded spot and that way he is explaining further by meditating on god in solitude the mind acquires then the three words is telling the very interesting when we are meditating in the seclusion in a quiet place three things we get what knowledge then dispassion then devotion see the three words is telling and how one is getting the knowledge at the same time devotion and he is using the word dispassion in between the two it's not just that randomly saying if you have to develop the devotion to god you need dispassion if you have to develop the knowledge for god about god you need dispassion so dispassion is in between supporting both and here he is telling he will get the knowledge dispassion and devotion together with this you must practice discrimination so knowledge dispassion devotion we acquire through meditation and then what we have to practice he said together with this you must practice discrimination do you understand he is asking him said yes sir now if we look at this this is this knowledge means gyana and what is that knowledge no jayati knowledge doesn't mean the information about many things knowledge means this realization what is that realization every sunday morning when you are chanting that is knowledge and there is a wonderful knowledge not jayate i never born many people will be asking what is the date of birth and all children will be so happy happy birthday they will be telling and they will be celebrating but the atman never gone now so naturally it is not death also not birthday it never grows no pikati never decays because nitya is constant eternal every moment everywhere is nitya this is the knowledge just by hearing we can understand is so difficult it's not so easy one person is to come to surama krishna and hypocrite he will be telling that i am in the path of knowledge i don't like devotion all this the path of knowledge i follow i'm a gyani i am a gyani he used to tell every time and what happened he took some loan from somebody and couldn't repay it back so naturally they went to court and quoted the same the order that his whole house and the house of properties that they will take and then sell and then money will be they will take away the money etc and then he was crying oh my property then why you are crying now you are a call he used to say tell himself means akasha sky and naturally nothing can touch akash the space so much of dust is flowing as if it is contaminating the akasha no it's nothing the sky is always free though so many things we see on it so he used to tell himself as a cop when takur is telling why you are crying now some of those people are taking away your utensils and nothing simple things and now you are crying so much you are attached to so much and used to see yourself as call a call call and call means akasha so this is the if you have to be a gyani that knowledge means this way ramana maharshi he practiced this path it's not so easy very very difficult vivekananda was again but at the same time within his heart there's a lot as a devotion and that what is devotion then we find that pita whatever you do we are giving it to god before food after food at the time of cooking everything all these things that we do we have to give it to god ramakrishna namaste i couldn't take the name of god i never could remember him that bakulatha that is called bhakti and this gyana and bhakti is achieved supported only by dispassion and then come discrimination about these two we will be discussing in the next day so let us this is now changes needed foreign is so my you
