[144: Panchama Veda 144- The Gospel of Sri RamaKrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75px3Jcl0BM)

good evening mrs. Chang dis mantra then he'll start reading Tavo khatam rhythm dr. G Burnham Kobe very rhythm Calma Shaba seven among golem three Magatha tum to be green and de bourree dodging aha we were discussing about the Avatar God's incarnation very interesting that topic Raghavan Ramakrishna is mentioning about it and he is giving a complete idea about the God's incarnation and what is the purpose of the incarnation it says the page 359 that we are studying now it is God alone who incarnates himself as man the God is incarnated that's why in Sanskrit they call it Abu Torah is coming down as if so God is incarnated himself as man to teach people the ways of love and knowledge this is very important usually in the bhagavad-gita which we frequently quote what is the purpose of an Avatara why he is coming to establish the Dharma righteousness when the rise of unrighteousness come then the God come and then clean that a to establish righteousness and here see Ramakrishna the same thing in a different way but very uniquely he said to teach the love and knowledge now whom we can love to love we need at least to the association without the association how can we love that God we cannot see we cannot talk we cannot touch we can smell and then how we can understand God the reality whom we cannot do anything with our five senses how we can like God how we can love God that is the reason the human being right from the beginning they are confused again and again they are becoming someone is coming in a very convincing way he or she is telling this is the God he must have to follow some people nearby getting inspired and following then ultimately they find nothing so this is the reason that God Himself is coming to give this teaching so when we are trying to develop the Lighting's Association can help us with the Association of that particular being of the God of the reality if you get the Association how the God can come and give you the sensation so he comes in the form of human being otherwise it will be very difficult suppose the God has come and leaving in our neighborhood having ten hands and so many double the legs and so many aids do you think we will be able to go and talk to him will be afraid we won't be able to have the association forget about the love and that is the reason the God is coming just like as a human being and when he is coming as a human being that association people are coming to see Rama Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu see Krishna whether Hindu incarnations and also we consider very strongly that Jesus is the incarnation of God but the Christian the world did think that he is the second personality of the Trinity and he is the son of God something a little not exactly like the Hindus a little different but the incarnation of God when we go when we see when we hear my god this man is so unselfish is full of love full of compassion and he is constantly inspiring people and forgiving us for so many different ways we are making the Mystics and he is going on for giving us all these good qualities we see manifested practiced in that particular life so he like and when we are liking him following him naturally his words are inspiring and I am getting influenced by his not only words but his life so that is also reflected in our life but only Association on do we need to have the knowledge otherwise God is here now the Segawa Tichenor he passed away in 1886 so obviously so many people lived with him that time it was a but the modern age many people is to come to him but after coming after mixing after seeing him after talking with him they were not inspired at all rather these two could easily say Ramakrishna in many ways so the only if you are coming and having the association of the God manifestation of God that won't help you have to have the knowledge but once I Ramakrishna giving a beautiful story through that story he is narrating explaining and he sends a huge piece of diamond to earth there in the beating heart and the villages is to come to be in that pond and the days to come and this to rub their heels on that not knowing what is that that's rough thing so to clean their field is to rub their feet on that and that was the use of the diamond Association were there everyday DS to come this to see this to touch but they never realized how what he that was once a person diamond merchant he came he understood immediately my god is such a costly thing so naturally he said I will make this pawned in a different way give this to me then you can take the villagers they never knew so they gave that time on to the diamond merchant so you need your own knowledge to understand a person who is really pure and that is why Shankar Acharya I always called you all wrote the three things are necessary for a human being and that is possible only with the blessings of God the part of the human being Manu Sutra that the desire to be free from the bondage of God standeth the circle again and again we are taking birth and then suffering and little enjoyment and again we are dying it goes on and on and on so the desire to go beyond this moment sugar but these two is again it is possible who will guide you the Manutius to Momo Sutra then he says third Maha Purusha Shyam Estrella it had to get the blessings of a real good personal person who has realized God himself in the present-day world if you just google search the holy people who were here around immediately I think in Illinois you will find minimum 10 more than that all holy people there clearly all over America over all over the world millions they are claiming I am available how you will know you will confused so and then they know how the impress people so obviously people are all running towards those things unfortunate they had the desire to get the knowledge of God they got the human but they had the desire developed the desire to know God but the third thing is that is the mistake and that is raised knowledge is necessary who will give the knowledge incarnation of God and that is the reason the last time we read bhagavata-dharma Krishna's day when the greatest manifestation of God is through incarnation the devotee should worship and serve an incarnation of God so we read that the devotees should worship and serve an incarnation of God this is very very important the incarnation of God otherwise it is impossible if the God reveals himself then only we can know it about him so this overturn so before we go to this and I was just going through to checking what the Islam is talking about the Incarnation the totally denying no God cannot take the for you and for no for the God is completely beyond that the Islam never accepted even the fractions of Islam the original the real the that they don't to accept but the bhai we also do not some of them so Islam in that way Judaism also do not accept that Buddhism is an artistic religion they do not believe in the Creator so the part of creator of the manifestation of the creator they do not believe but a fraction of the Buddhism that is division Buddhism be accepted Lama Dalai Lama so Dalai is the name Lama is their actual title spiritual title so the Lama means highly virtuous feature and they are the emanations of the Buddha's so that way they are accepting again and again they are coming to help the humanity to give them guide them etcetera so that is called the lamas and about the Hinduism we have of course incarnation and then in DSM says the sometimes God is coming with full power that is called Pune avatara the complete manifestation of the power power of God and that time millions and millions are getting that knowledge and becoming free it's called Pune abogado again there is called am sure Avatara the partial manifestation of the divine power that is also like the arch area son garage area Ramanuja acharya they are the teachers spiritual teachers they come the guide and when they are coming they are going can you imagine a 8 years old boy he has learned all the scriptures mustard the bad answer eight years and in 12 years is the teacher and the great scholars were accepting him as their teacher and in a beautiful way in a couplet they say look at that wonderful picture the teacher is a junior young boy and the students are all mature people elderly people sitting at his feet teacher is not talking at all but even then all their doubts are removed so that is the way Shankaracharya how it is possible obviously the manifestation of power in him otherwise it is impossible you know that 1893 Shami Vivekananda 29 years young man he stood over here in the Chicago parliamentary religion and he addressed the gathering sisters and brothers of America and all they were mesmerised they stood up clapped and whole America immediately knew about him all the doors of the high and rich people were opened for him he started visiting so many places giving them the table and they were appreciating him is it possible for any ordinary person just go and talk and immediately they'll be impressed it is not this is the manifestation of God the power of God and there are some Hindus they accept Leela Avatara with a mister they are born and because of their manifestation a divine play goes on so the Sahaba thora the thing about the incarnations of God is listed in the Hinduism they are that classification but we Hindus we accept our dollars the incarnations and see ramakrishna is telling the formless God is real and equally real is God with form so these are the two things formless God is real and equally real is God with for mr. and Leela the two Sanskrit world is using niihka means eternal no change that is called formless condition Leela with form so obviously different type of divine plays goes on both are real that is the speciality of ceramic isne majority of our people come and they say this world that you see are all usually in the vedantic a hardcore vedantam they say like that this world is completely illusion it's nothing but you feel hungry as long as you feel hungry as long as you feel I consciousness so long you cannot say this is illusion that is real obviously that reality may be temporary but still it is real when I am dreaming the dream is a reality at that time at that moment I cannot deny it but when I wake up that time the dream is a dream and that has no reality so you had to wake up first you have to know you have to realize you have to feel then only it is possible otherwise not just healing I have read from the new book and then altering and telling that is not that I am he I am that most of the people are nowadays in baton so they are telling like that is good it is true but to whom who has realized it otherwise it is not possible and sometimes some people you know in India now they are arresting some of the people they were claiming that they are medical doctors but they were showing some fake certificates to now they are getting arrested people are complaining so they were claiming that we are doctors and society also accepted them but when the started treating then they understood they are all fakes a doctor won't treat a person a patient in that way so obviously if you are a fake even if you claim the diamond avatar and God I am on the Brahman after some days you'd be exposed to the world and people will find you the true thing is necessary now it is 2000 years have passed a millions of people are accepting Jesus why truth was there that is the reason that so many people came claimed and now they're in Oblivion who remember them like that although avatar is the great avatar three Krishna only the last this Monday yesterday that was is the birthday tt John mass to me all over the Hindus they celebrated that Christian man when Krishna was born more than three thousand years before and some people they are calculating that is the calculation comes according to the position of the stars 3102 that is the year when crucial world was form and then Krishna was acting person obviously we can understand that it was something like there at least before three thousand years so naturally the our reality otherwise how it is possible truth was there and now we have to follow so Miss Tia and Lila are the two aspects of the same reality Raghavan Ramakrishna he is now mentioning indirectly about himself why because the contemporary people they do not understand when the sri krishna was there when now we are accepting him as incarnation of God the God himself and worshiping me meditating on him and fasting to get his blessings doing so many things when krishna was alive how many people went to him recognized him accepted him respected him very few similarly when sadhana business was alive how many people came to him so many people saw him the god but didn't recognize the lord jesus would claim that i am the son of god seeing me is as if seeing God that is true but how many people understood that other they misunderstood rather and killed him so brutally so naturally the contemporary people cannot understand see Ramakrishna is giving the game to the very close group so that they can understand about his divinity he said the once my father went to gaya a very famous building place where the manager there the deity is the Vishnu Lord Vishnu and this is a Vishnu the god from whom all this incarnation comes once my father went to Gaia they are Raghuveer rather will is the Rama Chandra say to him in a dream I shall be born as your son so this is very important Vishnu the conception of Vishnu all-pervading God but as because when it is all pervasive we cannot concentrate we cannot get any idea of this all-pervading consciousness so therefore the Hindus they understood that we don't be possible so they have made in this way the conception of personality impersonal became personal from the Rigveda time the Rig Veda is a very very old scripture of the first book of spirituality very first book of spirituality and that Rig Veda he's understood that all pervading the consciousness how many people will understand that so they say Sahasra shisha Purusha sahasrar option SAR shabad in sanskrit salsa means thousand Shiva means the eight thousand eight thousand hands thousand faith is it not exactly the thousand is unlimited whatever you see is nothing but the manifestation of the same God and I was giving that example when a person came to Jesus and said you are asking that we should forgive the brothers even if they are making any mistake my brother is constantly doing this mistake how many times you think that I should forgive him then the jesus answered seventy times seven does it mean 17 to 7 that many times I should forgive no infinite times all the time so here also this is Sahasra so also means thousand it doesn't mean the thousand exactly all infinite the conception we can understand at least to some extent what is infinity when you close our eyes and can imagine that all the heels that we see is nothing but the manifestation of the same God and all the hands that is working is the God God's hands of working so that we the vastness that comes so impersonal become personal even then it was not possible for meaning so slowly it is narrowing down for the benefit of the ordinary people to understand then the same power seeing God is coming descending in the human form just giving occurs here we find that the great God in the form of Raghuveer Sri Ramachandra he is asking that pious Brahman Sri Rama chatter birthday is the father of the three Ramakrishna he said I like to accept you as my father God is telling why because he is so quiet he is the pottery he's the devotee of Rama gender his only Idol was the Raghuveer this is how much under the manifestation another form of the Vishnu so he was worshipping him that God in his dream requesting I shall be born as your son thereupon my father said to him Oh Lord I am a poor Brahmin how shall I be able to serve you then the God is killing don't worry about it Ravi replied I will take care of it so this is the wonderful conversation you may believe in me not but it is hundred-person truth if you don't believe the loss is yours and if you believe the wonderful conception that will be there that God is coming to earth and he is arguing us but to whom that all Sunday is not any Tom Deacon added God is coming to a person who was so pure in heart he neighbors till our turd a single ball thing leave a heart anyone his heart was so pure because he was completely unselfish his love for each and every being is love for God his concentration for God his detachment for this worldly life all those things made him so close to God God chose him for that so this is the reason he is trying to come manifest as a son of that Brahman then see on Krishna was born he is giving the hint ramakrishna never could say hi there was no not a single out of ego in him he could never say I and all the time we are so proud Ramakrishnan neighbor could feel that way even then he's giving these descriptions why so that we can understand he was not ordinary soul he is telling once so my sister he there is mother Rheda Rama and he is to serves the ramakrishna he was very close to see Ramakrishna my sister used to worship my feet with flowers and sandal paste you know the Hindus they used the flowers and Sangha based his sister is to worship Him one day I placed my foot on har hailed and say to her you will die in Banaras men are as it is to know that is the very famous plug-in Center is of the in India the centre of India the Vanaras on the bank of river Ganga the Hindus they believe if anyone is dying over there in the small city immediately he'll be liberated so he is giving the heat not that you have to go to Banaras that particular place but you will get liberation as because the sister understood that my brother is not the ordinary person and that failed that love that has a situation grew in knowledge my brother is God this is something very very special so that lady and the God in the form of the small little boy God odda is giving the blessings that you will be completely free he is giving another incident once Mathura who said to me father there is nothing inside you but God your body is like an empty shell it may look from outside like it pumpkin but inside there is nothing neither flesh nor seed once I saw you as someone moving with a veil on mother burger was a very rich person he is to support Ramakrishna is to donate a lot Ramakrishna is to consider Ramakrishna the holiest person is to call him with great respect and love Baba the father spiritual father one group of Japanese lady came they took initiation from one of our Amagi and they learned that Baba and one lady came she was telling me Baba the little Japanese work no the new work and if okay wherever you learned the bava bava means the father you are so respected that this is called the spiritual father so he is telling that Motul Babu who's to call him as Baba has respect him so much he realized it because Association because the love because the knowledge the motor bubbles knowledge direct association with Ramakrishna motive over once saw Sudama Krishna is pacing up and down there are two buildings if you go to dictionary is all there still and from his own place he could see the Ramakrishna facing up and down and he was wondering this is ordinary man to the village man so he is just here I don't know why I am respecting him so much is it worth me when he was killing like that thinking like that suddenly he saw season o Krishna going down as Goddess Kali and then coming up again as Shiva it was the knowledge and action that is called Shiva Shakti the Kali the goddess is destroying creating also the whole action of God done through that form goddess Kali is the power of God and the god Shiva is complete knowledge but without any action doesn't do anything they do not do anything so this is the motor Babu sir and then onwards he developed so realization knowledge only gives the real love so he was salam o Krishna said I am shown everything beforehand he's mentioning about himself I am shown everything beforehand one I saw go Ranga and his devotees singing Krypton in the panchayati the pancha booty means the place of five trees and below that five trees if you go and meditate your spiritual awakening becomes very quick so that is very sacred place holy place I think I saw a ball around there and you too bholaraam also was a great landlord a German God but very humble very devoted so that is even though they were very rich but they were very humble so this is the way Ramakrishna is mentioning and you means the master Russia was noting down the words was published this book that great teacher he was a one heir the principal of a school and that master Mercer the ramakrishna saw him in that and not only that you know those who have gone through the biography of Swami Vivekananda when the pivot under the young boy of sixteen seventeen years old young man came see ramakrishna saw him and immediately stood up and with the folded and he was thinking that you are the Narayana you're the Great God from heaven you have taken this form the power of Shiva within you the boy was thinking oh my god boy this man is talking like this I am the son of so-and-so why he is behaving like this why because he could see all through us friends this is see Ramakrishna we have really experienced some of our Swami's I am not mentioning the mean because Ramakrishna mission don't like to mention all this type of miraculous power so one of other Shami he was blind and is a excellent person realized solely consider him one young broom Jerry came and he was claiming the barometer he was claiming that I have seen realized goddess Kali I went addiction issues what is Carrie revealed us said before me I had a talk with her now I'm a highly spiritual person I still liked that drama Chen he was almost my contemporary I told you it's okay you have realized Kali then why you have to say that you have realized God keep it in your mind that's all no I have to go and discuss with the president vice president or some spiritual hate something like that then ultimately he went to him you know that he was in a very high hierarchy in our order so they had to take the appointment and then that particular day he went the Xiaomi stuff to all of the work and he was perhaps he was eager to know about the realization of that young man the Brahma Charlie means the novice in the spiritual life so when this boy winged Swami that all others they went out the door was closed so there is the private talk and the moment these young men dust his feet the Xiaomi couldn't see him but from the touch itself he started telling almost shouting hey will this you told that a young man will come who is who has realized goddess Kali but he is a sinner over here he has done these he has done these he has done this old lispy was going on telling all through his life what he was the bad thing he has done everything was revealed before him in a flash just it touched his feet can you imagine the tremendous power so if that is possible then why not it is possible for God the Ramakrishna to see each and every so I can see your mind as I see the things kept in a glass Almeida used to say ceramics yesterday I can see your minds I can see everything we cannot hide anything from God so it is better to be kindness is better to be open just a child is coming to God I have done some something which may be good which may be bad I do not know I liked it I didn't even have done anything wrong please forgive me that's all he's our Father he's our mother then naturally his love as no bound at all the ceramic richness teaching that that I am shown everything beforehand whoever is coming then he said I wanted to know the experiences of go wrong let me straighten the Mahaprabhu almost I wonder 600 years before see Rama Krishna he came this chilton democra boo he was also the tsunami simple guy with an thin sannyasi like us but he was too for the betterment of the ordinary people given complete the dedication was to develop devotion to taken the Mahaprabhu I wanted to have experience about that person he was so many years before even then and I was shown them at the Shamburger in our native district I wish that you should go to India and all these people assess that they are still there almost like that at the time of serum occasion like that still there and so many things happened over there so ceramic is NESHAP go down go mahaprabhu it crowd gathered they even climbed the trees and the wells and wall sorry they stayed with me day and night for seven days I had no privacy whatsoever thereupon I said to the divine bother bother I have at enough of it the Jesus was walking and the multitudes were following what was there in Jesus he was not throwing the gold he was not giving money he was not giving anything but the multitude gathered wherever he went manifestation of God's power when the manifestation of God power within that attracts you were bound to come to him there is no other way so this is who was the king that time who were the rulers who are the people who have known unless and until they are connected with the light of Jesus Christ now we read the words of Jesus the life of Jesus then he come to know though that was the king that he was at time and the access meant was going on tax was going up all this information would have bothered about it maybe somewhere in the corner of history it would have been but as because they came in contact with the Jesus they also became known thousands thousands years before afterwards so this is what he saying that Terrapins Ramakrishna understood how people go mad when a really true holy person comes I am at peace now he is now telling an ting a very interesting statement he said I am at peace now that means my all these things now complete do you he is mentioning I shall have to be born once more therefore I am NOT giving all knowledge to my companions I shall have to be born once more again the God will come again he will come to help these people how to realize God first and foremost to develop knowledge about God and love for God lost love is the last but to love a person we have to understand something about him after understanding those things those qualities that I like it and when I'm liking it then slowly slowly to be deep and then only it will be possible to love and when love comes there is no doubt at all that is the beauty of the love the love doesn't mean having the doubt again I am loving now it is not possible love means just like the flawed it goes then cover everything so it says like this I recognized you on hearing you reading the Chaitanya Habakkuk is the holy book you means that master Masha she was reading a book immediately Ramakrishna recognized unless and until a person is devoted he can never even read the holy book properly the people are reading so many different types of books but when a person is reading a holy book and if he likes it loves it and each and every word that he is reading immediately will be revealing to him or heart and the feeling will be completely different so that is the way if we are reading and it says I recognized you on hearing you read the chaitanya Baga but you are my own this is a unique way Ramakrishna is giving to the writer you are my own the same substance like father and son I and my father in heaven are one Jesus say the same substance as a father and the son so this is the all the qualities of God if it is manifested in human being then we consider him as God as Jesus claimed himself the son of God I and my father in heaven are one again he said not that I am only any one of you can the kingdom of heaven is within you potentially what is the kingdom of heaven purity and then again he clearly failed blessed are those who are pure in heart for they shall see God so only things that we have to be very much cautious about purity what is this purity show me we become the same unselfishness the more and more and more we become unselfish unselfish means love and how we can love other people those who are blaming me criticizing me creating problem for me how can he love him love those completely different those who like me respect me concern about me I can love them this is easy but those who are completely different how can we then comes the knowledge because they are also the manifestation of my same God same holiness so this is go and see Ramakrishna is mentioning the same substance like father and son he is mentioning all of you are coming here again when you pull when you pull one part of the call me creeper there is a creeper if you will want all the whole bunch come so like that all the branches come toward you you are all relatives brothers suppose Rakhal origin others had gone to bowie we were there two would you leave separately so texas the devotee during the manifestation of God calms the different type of people come together because they are God's own whoever is coming to the philosophy of Saddam Oh Krishna which is purity and love which is unselfishness and dedication anyone coming may be different language different religion different culture but they all come and become one and they become very close to God you are our my own you are my own so that is why I again and again from here only I tell the devotees River is coming on visit at least they have got the call otherwise they won't count there is no dancing there is no songs in that way it is only pure philosophy is going on not that we feel not that we see anything give you anything only few throws off is going on but even then days after these people are coming listening hearing reading and practicing this they must be there very close to the present god manifested in the form of ceramic resna before you came here you didn't know who you were now you will know it is God who as the Guru makes one know so when a person is coming first doesn't know one gentleman came and he saw I saw on your board all are welcome so I thought I can come I mean yes why not you are welcome so what is there I told see this is the shrine and there is a library thing else he said okay he came he said a 15 15 minutes he came to my office and he said I think this is the place I should come at will how come because the moment I don't know what who are those those pictures are there but I felt that they're very close to me I close my eyes and that was the first time I felt peace in my heart the people in the world that tormenting so many different type of problems burning when they come and pray to God there's no difference whether you were born here or there whether you eat these or that whether you are speaking this language of death it doesn't matter at all for God because the sovereign substance you are his own as the Son and the father so obviously that is the beauty before you came here you didn't know who you were now you will know that is the greatest blessings so that's why I always say to people read gospel we did so many thousands of books and completely confused about the religion and the wastage of time our purpose is to know what is spirituality and how to acquire the spirituality and where to go how to go so that is the thing and in the pages of the gospel of the Rama Krishna in a very simple way he is guiding that giving that and he says that before you came here you didn't know who you are now you will know why because God will help you God will become your guru your preceptor your master and you will guide you and there is giving a story that your heart from he is guru so that story in the next day we will read and that is explaining why one need a guru in the path of spirituality and that guidance is essential we can read books we can understand many much better wave me than comparing with many others but still the spiritual part we need guru to sadhana krishna will be telling about that and you will hear him in again in next Tuesday thank you for coming let us chant this mantra and then we conclude it says the salute a shinto bhagavati Ramakrishna the perfect embodiment of the eternal truth which manifests itself in various forms to help mankind and the incarnations of the Supreme Lord who is worshipped by all need engine on a stem on entire bomb [Music] popped on come for
