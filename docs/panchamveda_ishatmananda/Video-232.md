[233: Panchama Veda 233 : How Can a Person Conquer Passion?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxruBAoEyWI)

Namaskar dear devotees and Friends please chant along with me Tabu Kadam rhythm dr. jay burnham kobe be rhythm Calma sharp 'him sravana Mangalam three madam booby green and de bourree dodging aha the bhagavad serum krishna he was talking with the devotees and it was Saturday October 11 1884 being a true spiritual teacher taku never left any opportunity to guide the spiritual seekers this is a we can notice in his life his time was short so he wanted to give a wonderful message and that to the people whom he was meeting all the time they were not ready for that high standard high valued teaching very broad and very unique teaching today we will discuss about a one or two sentences that he has said and it was in the master Masha has mentioned advised to Ishaan he was talking with that afterwards will come but he was induction Essure people have come and they were talking and ceramic is new was whenever he was talking he gave them all the advices in a wonderful way he said that the scripture mentioned that the human life is very special very precious why because only the human can get the liberation all others the only can survive food and security these are the two things they only want but the human being they always think how to get the freedom freedom from the bondages what is the bondage the mental tension where from the tension comes from the desire and what is the source it is the mind so they slowly slowly understood their mind is the cause but what is the mind we will come to that this mind is such a thing that we cannot operate and take out and give it to somebody else or throw it away now it is not possible we cannot replace the mind from somebody else as a good person has passed away take his mind and replace it with somebody else no we can do the I die I Corona maybe other parts of the bodies but not with the mind the mind is so subtle but mind is more forceful and in the mind different type of desires are there but at the same time there is a word that has been used called passion there's a tremendous desire deadly desire I can say because it is mixed with many other things and ceramic isne will talk about that but before that he is mentioning among the people with all desire there's a group of people who are those who develop dispassion from early youth those who roam about yearning for God from boyhood those who refuse all worldly life belonged to a different class the people is to come to see Ramakrishna Serrano kitchen is to guide them telling them different the spiritual the ways but not to all those who were not seeking for liberation or at least something about religion Sri Ramakrishna was not interested with them he used to love them used to like them but like the children if they come we don't discuss philosophy with them similarly the people who were coming to see Ramakrishna not not ready for the spiritual life ceramic is nice to ask them to go to see the flower garden other places and go and visit and talked with your friends but those who were sincere Serrano Krishna's to tell them and see Ramakrishna could understand who is a sincere person the always is to visit see Ramakrishna this to seat over there this too eager to listen to him and when he is talking when they are listening their faces are lighting lifting up and when Ramakrishna is singing they are also joining all those things prove that these people are ready they can understand see Ramakrishna the few but Solano kitchen is to encourage them and he encouraged that type of people again through generations after generation through this book the Pancham Aveda the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna the master ma che recorded it and it has been translated into so many languages here he fine he is mentioning a group of people human but from the childhood from the boyhood they want to realize God so that is a different class the one thing is proved among the human being and human being means the mind among the human being there are people who like to enjoy the worldly objects is a one class one group another they like religion and also want to enjoy the worldly object second group ceramic esna included them too and Saddam Krishna's main students were those people the we're in the household they wanted to enjoy the worldly objects but at the same time their mind was hankering for the religion for the spirituality they wanted to know so obviously they were the main listeners they were the main students of Salaam o Krishna and the third group which he just now mentioned there's a from the right from the childhood with a young boy that when they are young their mind don't like to enjoy the worldly objects we find those people there are different class now he is telling people who practice renunciation from early youth belong to a very high level why high level this is a again one group they want to enjoy the worldly objects and a group in between worldly objects and also religion and third group they don't want to enjoy the worldly objects their mind is focused on God now from the bad antic point of view of any religious point of view this world is nothing but illusory but the illusion is so wonderful this Maya is so great it's very difficult to think that it is not true in that country and those who have tried and in the past lives also they have tried then only they have come to this condition so they don't feel attraction to these and they understand the teachings of the scripture very correctly they understand it very correctly and follow it also and then see ramakrishna is mentioning about it how can him man conquer passion the passion the word has been described sometimes in the in in the christian world in a different way is a hankering for God is the passions they have mentioned but the passion we know the strong desire for the kernel enjoyment so that is called passion that is the strongest desire and how to overcome it before we go to the answer that the ceramic isne has given let us try to understand it from the badonk point of view from the scripture every simple book that Shankracharya mentioned very nicely and that we will do today our topic is how to conquer passion he mentioned this passion and where from this passion comes the strong desire to enjoy the the flesh in my mind all desires are coming from the mind the Shankaracharya he is mentioning in one of his in the BVA kachou Romani he is mentioning mana showed on our kurta beer you have to purify the mind shodhan shouldn't means purified you have to purify the mind that sometimes the drinking water they are supplying even then we make a filter through the filter we take that water and drink there's purification shodhana the this shodhana of what of mind and how to make it so we will try to understand the purification of the mind human life is very very special because it can get the liberation and it is again in the bondage why through my mind is most important I think from 22nd and 23rd many a police Minnesota Minnesota their devotees they are organizing an online retreat on meditation the cause of meditation so we will discuss in details about this but today when we were reading the pancham of Veda we had to understand our own mind we know that we have a mind everyone knows it but what is this mind do you know that what is this mind this Shankar Acharya and the bead and they have found out that it is the combination of the mind with the gun indriyas the ganon driana chur manouschka mano - yad Ganon Brioni what are the gun indriyani Yana means knowledge India means all the senses the the Hindus they have very wonderfully the analytical way they have tried to understand the human mind and there's this understood that the in the human body there are so many other things there are also the eye the ear the nose the tongue and the scheme these are the five senses were going out and bringing information for the Maya from for the mind and what the Roopa Reza sub dispersion ganda these are the five objects the phone and taste the sound touch and the smell these are the five objects the five senses they are collecting and it has been termed given the name at Gianna indriya Jeremy's knowledge they're bringing the information the dis punch again indriyani plus mind when combined together and that is called mono Maya the kosha the sets are there five sets are there this is the mono Maya kosha this mental set manomaya kosha how it works me and mine mama uh-hum ET mono me uh-hum uh-hum me mama de mine the mama homme ET the me and mind disease the cause now we come to saddam krishna say that you have to overcome the passion to realize god and passion is the most strong desire and this desire is there inside the mind and now we know what is this mind is the combination of the mental mind at the same time it is a test with the five ganon draya's and this ganon dis bringing the information the mind is analyzing and sending out all the instructions and the ganon drear's also the common areas are performing all the india's are performing so mind is the most strong thing and this mind how it works basic is me and mine and by that way it is differentiating all things are the same no mind will say no all children's are there but mind will say this is my son and that is not my son so me and mine the mind is differentiating and those who want to want the god-realization should purify the mind clean the mind how first we have to understand the that this tremendous force that is working through the mind Shankar Acharya has given a beautiful example and he says that in the Buick Germany 176 verse mano nama maja backgro Bashir aren a boom issue charity otra nikhat chin to saw double e mu Mucha ba he's giving an example as if the mind is a tiger and the tiger is roaming in a forest and that forests are all desire all the desires make a forest and the mind is roaming into that now if you like to save your life don't go to that forest indirectly Shankara is telling don't enjoy the worldly objects so that is how you can purify your mind the mind has to part the mind is it can give you the liberation it can bind you with these desires so we have to understand this mind naturally get attached with the Saints objects we're from the same subjects come to another question the mind we have understood from the prakruti I'm not going to the root of the creation the prakruti it has come the mind is also there and in the mind again we find that it is the main spatial function of the mind me and my and me and mind it goes to the objects the Saints objects from there the mind is collecting all the information and bringing but we're from them this objects came the very unique thing is the objects were also created by the mind the mind created the objects then mind is going to enjoy those objects and then the mind is binding the person who is access to eat those things now it is very clear the mind mana Presutti Bishoy on Rosh Hashanah the uncounted unlimited objects where from it came from the mind only so mind is creating the objects then mind is sending the sense organs and then the mind is enjoying so-called enjoyment of the saints this are the sense objects and the cause is misery why because again because of those desires one has to come back into life in what form we do not know and then suffering so if mind is that that is mind is creating now again if we ask that how the mind is creating the answer the bed anther gives is called at the Aza at eásá and a pavada these are the two subjects are there the Edessa is covering what the mind is covering something that is true and first it is covering then it is super imposing which it wants to see evil and it will notice that some people they are liking their son other people from the point of view of the other people these look at that boy is ugly his color is like that the form is like that behavior is like they don't like but the mother and the father also the parents for them is the most beautiful child in the world how the same object can be two different way that is the cause of the mine when I look to someone to me that person is very good and I get attached to that attracted to that I like to develop friendship with that person whereas the other people around me they look at the same person but they are not interested how it is possible Adi aza what is the idea sir so it is a individually I am super imposing first covering what is reality then superimposing whatever I like to see into that person or the object so Odessa is that first covering the truth and then imposing my ideas and then I am loving that object then I get attached to that this is a very peculiar situation who is binding me myself how through my mind why that I don't know I don't know why unnecessarily I am binding myself so this is the work and then Vedanta says work of the Maya and what is this Maya again mind mind is also a bit dia so the mind is a very very important subject to understand to discuss and because this mind is very forceful it can do anything show me we become this telling that if you see it in a cave and go on sending the powerful thoughts that reach to the all over the world and the world will change what the Rishi is did they did the same thing and it can penetrate that wall also there's the thought there's the mind and if the mind becomes pure like the cedar Jesus Christ he was not a rich person he was not a king but the taught that he taught and that is now covering the half of the world millions and millions of people are following Jesus Lord Buddha now Raghavan see Ramakrishna within a short period of time Sadam occasional ideology is reaching all over the world crowd only but the good thoughts where it is going to the mind through the mind to the brain and the people's mind that's slowly changing so this is the way it works now our goal is purification of the mind why because mind is contaminated with what we desire and of all the desires different type of desserts the passion is dangerous the ceramic krishna is telling you have to purify that passion and therefore for the liberation BBH Romani is advising that therefore mana mine showed Onam purification Guardium activity Priya neenah menasha na those who want to get the liberation does you want to get God realization they should very carefully purify their mind is should that is the first tape of the religious life purification of the mind then what is this purification of the mind there - we have discussed many at times it's a practice people should make a routine that in the morning we will get up then after devolution should go and sit in a corner and of the shrine and then we should meditate who should burn the incense sticks and who should take the holy name of God the Guru has given then you should read the holy books from few pages and constantly try to think of those things and then we we are giving that others are also external activities like giving the arms to the poor helping the needy people so that way we can do the recently one lady rang me and she was telling sharmaji we came to know that the tremendous that storm has come and a that one Eastern a part of the India and is devastated already this coronavirus problems are going on there and then this has come the how those people will survive can we help them I told you you're welcome so this thought is there how much we can help we do not know but I appreciated that lady she's sitting over there thinking and contacting her own friends and group collecting some fun from here so that we can send it to someone so they those people who are there working further are the people suffering there what is the beginning part I should try to do something well this thought came in the mind and this shodhana this is purification I should enjoy why should I give my money to those people let them die let them suffer I should go to a big hotel and enjoy I must keep the money or sadhana that is all dirty minds now in the from the Hindu point of view from the sanatana dharma they always say no in the bhagavad-gita it also very clearly dimension that if you are not helping others when you can that there the food that you are eating it will bring all offering to you so that is the way it all goes now this is the main thing will come to our the main book now brother balsa Ramakrishna mentioned about the passion and mana Mirage the lawgiver of the Hindus he said that the true knowledge about the sense organs one can control the passion or the mind he said mine the mind actually it is there in the passion all desires are there monomers addition is knowledge what is that knowledge just we are discussing here the knowledge of the mind what is this mind combination of the all five knowledge organs and also the mind that is the mind one of Maya kosha how the mind works the mainly me and mine and why it is doing that because it wants to enjoy what it you will enjoy objects where from the objects came from the minds again how mine could create the objects that he is going to enjoy by Adi Asha and Swiss super imposing on word on the truth on the reality on the god this world is nothing but God this world is nothing but the truth this world is nothing but the Brahman this mind is covering that truth that Brahman that God and then superimposing something that he wants to enjoy the mind wants to enjoy so this is the way it is binding the person who is attached to that mind cause suffering so Manu said understand it properly and then go beyond that and another it says be sure issue produced Danny Yatta Jionni no Nick Tasha this is the teaching of the Manu be sure issue produced Ani yet again Nina to understand the object and truly how it is going to how we will do that only two things we have to keep in mind is this object going to give me a permanent joy no no object can give you any Parvin anything because object means the be Shia it has been created obviously anything created going to be destroyed either today or tomorrow so this is not going to give any that way you have to discriminate and Wow as long as we are not getting the liberation so long we should add just with this way but not getting attached to this this is the Manu - teaching yoga vasishta he is little strong in this way and he very strongly he said hanyate be beca don dana be beca Don Dina with the stick of discrimination you kill those desires kill those desires through discrimination hanyate vivica Don Dina and Bhagavan C Ramakrishna said a very unique prescription and very very difficult to practice he said assume the attitude of the opposite sex the passion will be controlled now we will come to the book and it says like this how can a man conquer passion he should assume the attitude of a oh man a man oh man attitude is it possible ceramic is needed' and he is describing that he truly practiced it but as as I said is really really difficult very very difficult completely from the mind you have to transform yourself change yourself and your attitude will be completely different I in many days as the handmaid of god I dressed myself in women's clothes all this he is telling I was reading the the biography of her another yogi and there also he also mentioned that is in the last part of his life he practiced this thing and the Krishna was his lover and he assumed himself as the Krishna's and meant by that way the last or life a practiced and he realized God in that way so but this is very difficult do you know the significance of the Sheba emblem it is the worship of the symbols of fatherhood and motherhood and he said but it is quite different when one reaches perfection the he was telling about the practices now he is going to give us some idea about those who have already perfected in this practices but it is quite different when one reaches perfection after the realization of God there is not much for a man to fear the fear from what free from this world this object even in the monks life also a monk came very young sixteen seventeen years he left the heart and home joined the monastic order practice all through his life and then when he was almost sixty sixty two that time compassion came in his mind tremendous compassion for one lady who was suffering and she lost the father and the mother that orphan young girl is compared fashion wanted to protect that girl apparently very good but in the monastic life he could not succeed he did a very good great job he helped that lady and served her and all those things but the goal to reach the God that he failed why because again Wintour's the worldly object well where how it happened compassion love sympathy so many things it will just mesmerized your mind so it is very very difficult to get the perfection and if you ask oh then a man should become a person should become very and the krill not observing the suffering of others know exactly opposite the shadow are the moms at the Mandic and other this person who has left the heart and home their mind is very soft the mind is very compassionate full of love full of compassion but detached with detachment that is the main thing without detachment if we want to do anything obviously it will be and attach to work with the world and it goes to the same circle of birth and death and the karma fella the result of the work the ceramic Ishta therefore he is telling it is quite different when one reaches perfection after the realization of God there is not much for a man to fear he has become to a great extent secure the ceramic Rashmi is constantly using the masculine gender a man he in reality in those days the ladies never came out with the people those who are listening to Saddam occasionally were all male folk so obviously he was addressing them he used this now we can say a person because it is applicable to both the important thing is for a man somehow to climb to the roof after that he can even dance there but he cannot dance on the steps again after climbing to the roof you need no longer discard what you described before you find that the stairs are made of the same materials bricks lime and brick dust as the roof the woman you have to be so careful about at the beginning to the woman because he was talking with the men so he was telling that opposite 60 must be careful because it may take your mind to that the thing is to touch the granny as the children do in the game of the hide-and-seek see Ramakrishna if we notice he is constantly forcing us to realize God in this very life he started his ministerial job he started his the giving the the teaching to the world by saying the God realization is the goal of human life every human should realize God by saying that he is mentioning that's why again and again in different occasion he said that and he said that the thing is to touch the granny there is a game the children's is to play that there should be a granny inside and there are circles somehow you have to go the circles are guarding by some people the players opposite players and those who want to get the liberation should go inside there may be three circles guarded by the players and you have to somehow touch them enter into the first circle second circle and entering into the third circle you have to touch the granny and before that if though a pole opposite players if they touch you then you lost again again you have to begin but somehow if you can without being touched by the opponent players can touch the granny you are liberated ceramic is not mentioning that game these are all real games lost games nowadays in the villages of Bengal we have seen that the pit children is to play that you have to as a children do the games of the height and see and then you can do whatever you like now he is mentioning about the different stages of our life man looking on outward sees the clothes at that time his mind dwells in the anomeric ocean taking an hour us again to the vedanta the vedanta they have analyzed the human body as a five different shapes on Nemea pranamaya manu maya big Annamayya and ananda maya this is this is the way disease the first is the under minutiae the gross body next is the circle body functioning through the subtle body that the mind dwells in the monomeric osha the gross body and the circle body what is the subtle body the mind and there it is called mana mana kosher the sanskrit terminology and the big annamaya kosha this beginner Nicosia again the the elder our sense organs and also the five the knowledge sense organs and the mind and discriminative capacity that is called big Annamayya next is the causal body the causal body it's also the cause for that all this creation has come functioning through the causal body the mind enjoys Blees it dwells in the anomeric osha anandamaya kosha sorry anandamaya kosha this corresponds to the semi-conscious state experienced by chaitanya mahaprabhu last of all the mind loses itself in the great cause the cause of all causes that is the brahman from there only all things have come Hindus they believe that this Brahman which is one without second all-pervading consciousness it was like that and there is no creation but suddenly as if assuming how you know so assuming that a desire came crossed in the mind of that Brahman supreme Brahman formless brokered consciousness and what is the desire Iike ham Basia movie he I am alone I like to be meaning and from that the creation began the moment it just thought in that way and this creation started and the creation the first born was the Brahma that is the Hindu way of describing so the Brahma came and that knowledge was given to him he created and slowly slowly all this came the same creation the follow the that is also there in the philosophy of the Christianity Islam Judaism everyone is talking like that some we but it goes ultimately to the God when it goes to the ultimate to the God that's called great cause from the great cause that is the main thing from there all this thing has come the great cause it disappears it Marge's in the great cause what one experiences after cannot be described in words what is this Samadhi marching into the great cause what is nirvana what is this Mukti of course the need wanna the world is mainly used by the Buddhists and this Mukti by the Hindus and what is this Mukti liberation this is marching it with the great cause what is this great cause sadhana kishna seed is an experience but it cannot be described in this inner more state of consciousness jatin enjoyed this experience he is giving the example of the chaitanya mahaprabhu and this experience means the enjoyment of the supreme brahman the joy of the supreme brahman so that is called the enjoyment do you know what is the state is like Diane under described it come into the inner apartments and shut the door anyone and everyone cannot enter into that part of the house the Diane endure that is another very famous spiritual leader was there at that time ceramic is new coating him he's telling it is like entering into your personal apartment and closing it you only enjoy you only know but you cannot describe it you cannot share it with others that is different way it says that not a check shoe gotcha T na mano 'no bark the i cannot go there not the mind not the speech in the Upanishads in different way they like to explain that you have to experience it and the is only your experience you cannot share it why because this is not an object it has becomes the subject the subject cannot become the object you are finding yourself so that is the main thing what is God realization understanding my true nature I am already dead only things some coverings I have come on that and I'm trying to remove it with the help of the guru and the scripture we are removing the first is on Nemea culture and this body that is sustaining with the food then goes to the mind this goes to the intellect then then goes to the feeling of joy the like that it goes goes and then subtle up to subtle is and then come all timidly it goes and merges with the great cause this great cause the moment we merge with that one drop of water we can exam give the example the drop of water it becomes the ocean that that particular drop cannot come out and say now I am experiencing the ocean is these these days no it cannot come out it cannot see anything because it becomes that for which it was a they're trying striving to reach to the ultimate and after reaching over there after merging with that no one can come back to tell that Raghavan Saddam Krishna himself in one place he said that doll they're made of salt when to fathom the depth of the ocean and when it entered into that water it never came back because it is made of salt and salt is made of the thus aligned water of the ocean and it went to its own the place from where it came his main source and melted into that it became that ocean again so that is the idea why the realized people cannot explain it they give different example but that much so swarupa lucky Ana artist election there is another to terminology the two different vedantic terminology they say it is like this Tatas direction an example and sure OOP election er is a part of it this is such chit Ananda is it is just that it is eternal shot it is knowledge and such it Ananda it is bliss the dis such it Ananda that is its reproduction of the brahman but even then you cannot say this is Brahman no this is the problem I used to meditate on the flame a very important teaching now Bhagwan is giving he says sorry he said I used to meditate on the flame of a light sometimes some people they they'll like to learn the meditation they can practice the first you have to have a candle and when the you are concentrating on the candle the holder of the candle and the candle and it is burning the whole thing in the beginning you are concentrating looking at that close your eyes try to imagine that meditate that the whole thing second slowly slowly when you perfect in that when you can see the whole candle stand candle and the flame then try to remove the candle stand see only the candle and the flame right that way it will go and after that when you can see they can be very perfectly and your mind is not roaming here and there it only visualizes that candle within your mind then remove that candle look at the flame and from here we can follow see Ramakrishna he is telling I used to meditate on the flame of alight I taught up the red part as the gross body ceramic isne is thinking the first is the gross body the red part of the flame the white part inside the rate as subtle body and a thick stick like black part which is called as the causal body there's a naturally it'll be the trade will be there it burns and you can see that black part that is the causal body from that cause everything has come now from the cause is subtle from subtle - gross so our hours will be the opposite direction we have to go back calculation from the gross body to the subtle body and to the causal body and there from that we have to go to the great cause by certain signs you can tell when meditation is being rightly practiced ceramic is not giving from his own life the example how you will know that you are practicing the meditation properly by certain signs one of them is that a bird will see it on your aid thinking you are an inner thing a bird will come and they'll sit on your aid and it won't discriminate that you are a living human being it will think that you were just inner thing so it will come and sit on your head so that is the main way to forget the body the body consciousness should go and along with the body comes the mind and the mind is completely still the mind is only thinking about the God so we are slowly slowly entering into the deepest part of the meditation the sublime thing unexpressible so that one should practice sadhana Krishna now let us read from the pages I first met Keisha at a meeting of the additional several members of the shamash were sitting on the platform Keisha was the in the middle I saw him motionless as a log pointing to Keisha I say to Mathura Babu look here at Beit Beit has been shallowed by a fish that was the expression way of his talking he said the fish has taken that bait this Adama krishna is mentioning what is that the meditation is perfect his body still and the eyeballs are not moving the eyeballs are still so that we then can understand sadhana krishna first made keshavjee under chained he saw him meditating in that way and he liked it I said to motor babu look there that bit has been shallow by her fish because of that power of meditation he achieved what he wanted name fame and so forth through the grace of God we get another hint if we want the even the worldly things like the name fame and the wealth meditation can only help us and if we want liberation the supreme joy of spirituality meditation will help us and what is the meditation controlling the mind and what is the mind let us go back once again the mind is the mana plus five sense organs that we have to go back so this Saints organs taking us to the Saints objects we have to stop that and when you stop that we stop the mind to go out of the sense objects then what the mind will do it will go inside and when it goes to the inside and slowly with the help of the scripture understanding this knowledge we can understand that inside this body there are so other things are there from this gross body physical body then the the subtle body then the causal body then the great cause is also there our goal is to - that great cause so we have to meditate in that way and salam o krishna didn't give an example we can practice meditation with an object it may be the image of God it may be a picture of a holy man even it may be the flame of a candle but meditation should be in such a way so the one should forget the body one can meditate even with eyes open this is ceramic is 'no one can meditate even with eyes open one can meditate even while talking take the case of a man with toothache so what is meditation constantly remembering God constantly remembering the consciousness and forgetting all other things so 90% of the mind can go to that and with the same person mind we can very happily survive in this world we know this world and all the objects and the people all around and the things that are there are all temporary and so very temporary so we should not give our mind to that so what we should practice meditation and meditation one-pointed the consciousness one pointed mind to that particular thing from which everything has come it may be God it may be consciousness is may be Brahman it in whatever form we think and the first thing we should forget that our body and surroundings then the mind is trained with that mind even with open eyes we can work and when with the open eyes we are working whoever is coming in my side I'll consider that another form of God has come before me the person is asking something talking to me I am visiting someone everything is nothing but that God that in a beautiful song there's also the realize the expression of the realization the Ramprasad has mentioned like this the when you were traveling in the moving in the city you think that you are suck suckling the mother mother is the center as you always do as a holy circle in that in the temple same way the mother is standing in the center of the city and I am going round that Nagar veeramani karo production of Shama Mary any work that we listen we have to think oh these are the mantras the holy words the same everything whatever I am eating when I am sleeping when I am bathing when I am roaming when I am talking all the time think about God and that is called meditation with open eyes and meditation sitting in one corner and closed eyes that is also possible thank you friend we will read this they will continue this reading from here today we mainly our focus was how to overcome the passion and next time we will try to understand the different way of meditation let us conclude with this mantra need and Janet iam an entire bum Papa knew compa Drita become by Aisha wat arum para mission medium Tam Ramakrishna m-- she does Arnhem oh my Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry he
