[123: Panchama Veda 123 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXhbql46tKg)

evening let us begin today's our discourse on and the Pancham evade the gospel of ceramic ashina by reciting this Holies Luca Tabaka Tom rhythm topped achieve annum Kobe very rhythm Cal more shabam sabana mangalam srimad additem booby grinning de bourrée dodgin ah that whenever we do some work that brings the result the good result bad result and when we are studying this book as a book but is a full of knowledge the discussions the knowledge takes our mind very high to a spiritual plane so obviously one who is explaining those who will were listening all the get the benefit of this so that is the sloka that master Masha the person who recorded the conversation he mentioned in the beginning now today the conversation took place as per the record of the October sixteen eighteen eighty-three addiction Asia in the room of Sri Ramakrishna Sri Ramakrishna breaking the walls of the institutionalized religions are transforming the religion into spirituality so these are the two words religion and spirituality and this is very very important raghavan sri ramakrishna who was born in 1836 and then he practiced austere tapasya austerities for 12 years and he realized that God and the divinity and the soul the Brahman from different angles different paths then afterwards understanding the modern psychology he is telling that you must have to transcend from religion to spirituality and that is the movement nowadays all over the Western world and also other countries but this is very prominent in USA in America they are they say is be in our spiritual but not religious SB in our this is the movement what do they say they say that is a religion their main protest against the religion the religion is getting associated with the political movements with the politics and then marginalizing the freedom of thought you cannot think in this way you must have to think whatever we say so they are narrowing completely blocking the freedom of thought so the new movement is we are spiritual but not religious in a be an entry in b SB in our spiritual but not religious so this is only the recently this movement we find it in the attitude of a gwan see ramakrishna and he is telling we hear bhagawan sri ramakrishna liberal-minded devotees accept all the forms of god krishna cali sheba rama and so on liberal minded devotees so when he is mentioning their most of the time he is mentioning devotees but here he said liberal-minded devotees and this is we are studying the page 307 of the gospel of sri ramakrishna there he is mentioning like this liberal minded devotees their devotee they love God they are trying to follow the religion through some path but at the same time their mind is open and that's why vagabond see Ramakrishna again he is guiding because he split he is a perfect spiritual guide and he is guiding there's parents telling that there is a thing called nista just called single-minded devotion now the two things if we are liberal minded what happens we are today we are thinking this god is good that goddess is good or only this some few qualities are good those who are practicing this spiritual but not religion that movement there it'll confused as they do not know actually what is spirituality and at the same time they don't like to follow the religion that is associated with some of the politics and social movements and so all those things that is called institutionalized religions the religions that has some norms that has to follow these and that these people don't like it then what do they like spirituality what spirituality they are not really much clearer about it but they talk about some of the good qualities is that spirituality only some of the good qualities the good people model people but that is their spirituality so we have to reach to the spiritual that means to the spirit from where everything has come so bhagawan sri ramakrishna is telling okay to reach over there you need the niche star the sanskrit word mr. means one pointed devotion it may be for some ideology some god or goddess or maybe quality a good quality but that should be the one pointed one should cultivate those qualities which have been listed in the bhagavad-gita chapter 16 in the first three slow kurz under the caption do begoña what are the devo gunas divine qualities in the bhagavad-gita 16 chapter they give it a list of 25 qualities gunas and now to develop that what you should do to accurate these divine qualities one neat concentration the if we are practicing these and sometimes going here and there the mind it is only though our mind and mind is all the time traveling from this to that it's not concentrated and when it is not concentrated obviously we cannot get the benefit of the knowledge we here we forget we read we forget we are knowing it and then we cannot follow it why because of the mind that those who have attended those classes why we should meditate there we have discussed about the mind ship the big ship the muder a different type of condition of the human mind it is jumping from here to there and it's totally confused dumbfounded so different type of situation comes in the mind and with that mind if we try to reach to a goal the spiritual goal that is a good quality how to do that so ceramic isness telling is better to have an Easter then he is giving the example of the the that way she may our wish nabob this ladies from the brindavan gopi knees they are going to see the prisoner and the new krishna as the coward boy and then suddenly when he has become king and when they are approaching into that they are covering their face covering the faces and the link this is not the person we knew how can he show our faces to this man he is your Krishna only the Krishna wish to play over there in the brindavan he has become the team over here no we don't like to see this man we know only that person so that is one pointed devotion when Hana Hana was approaching immediately the God the Vishnu is say to his power the Lakshmi the police take the form of schita and I will take the form of Rama why because that is his devotion otherwise he will never accept us that is called devotion but not not narrowness so this one point ignis is necessary at the same time while practicing single-minded devotion towards one's own Ishta nishta one should not think that his chosen path is one and only bad that is the only thing there is nothing wrong in practicing my path but when I think this is the only path that is the problem narrow minded devotion leads to the person to bigotry and not to God the when a person is following that narrow mindedness is reaching student bigger to you only now when you read the life of some of the saints and sages the great spiritual as parents like mirabai who is constantly telling i have only krishna and nothing else in this world I don't like to see anything else but the Krishna the manifestation of god through the form of krishna is this bigotry no she is not hating others criticizing others pushing out others because for her everything is nothing but the Krishna that is the speciality though 1.8 the only one God one ideology but at the same time she is thinking everything in this world nothing but the manifestation of our chosen god that is Krishna so when we see things in that way there is no problem I am NOT hating others shahmeer awakened in one place is telling if lob means i have to hate somebody else is better not to practice love why should I love the love doesn't mean that I have to hate someone that is very be quality but some of the philosophy some of the practices they say before reaching to God whom you love whom you respect you must throw stone to that particular thing which you must hate so this is very peculiar why should we have to constantly think that I must hate someone to love someone that's where Shami BG said in this way why one should be broad-minded now the question the one should be broad-minded cinema Krishna said liberal minded why now comes the philosophy it's not the emotion is a philosophy we have the reason for this what is the philosophy bhagavan sri ramakrishna mentioned in one line manifold has come from one alone the relative from the absolute manifold so many has come from one alone and the relative from the absolute when the absolute the permanent the sout is there from there all these things have come that is the reason we should not hate others and we should constantly think that whatever you see is nothing but the manifestation of God sometimes the manifest in is so bad and at the same time I should shun that I should be away from that but not hating that Jesus is one place he said hit this scene not the sinner it is that bad type of practices that bad quality that i am not going to accept but at the same time not that somebody is already in the native that try to help them or at least pray for them to hit the scene not the sinner so this is the way we become broad-minded you may remember that in our last one class on october eleventh we discussed coating the Tantra cinema krishna mentioned that from one many has come and now there are so many varieties those who have attended the saga of the soul in the beginning we were discussing how many different ways the people have given the explanation how this world this universe have been created because when you are talking about some philosophy some method you must have to explain in the beginning what is this creation how this creation that is the first thing in the philosophy and second who created and third what is the relation between this to the Creator the creation the relation between the creator and the creation so that is the whole of philosophy all philosophy they are giving the answer to these in a different manner sometimes to analogy sometimes two stories sometimes through quoting this the life of great people the Creator the creation and the relation between these two so the great religions that go all old religions that we see if we go the first philosophy begins with the creation here we find in the Hinduism as we have already discussed in many places and all of you know we have three main paths leading to that goal same goal but the goal has been named in different ways he comes at Ypres mahadeva don t such means the truth that has been named are called mentioned in a different names who the buddha by don t a comes a big bruh lepra means those who have realized it they realized and give a name that's all but the same thing here we find in the tantra they say Sheba is the agent and he is transcendent shut tha is the instrument the eminent the one is transcendent which we cannot understand we cannot see we cannot touch beyond all our puncher India's so beyond that is transcendent but that is the truth from there all these things are coming so transcendent and Shakti from there is coming a man and now for the example we'd not know where the generator which is producing the electricity we do not know where it is here located some people may know but majority of the people don't care to know even where is the generator from the electricity is created but we are happy that the electric supply is constantly we are getting and we are burning the lives and the moutain fans and these and that everything is going on with the help of the electricity but do we care to know what is this electricity who is producing it where you stationed we do not know almost the same way we are very much careful and attentive to the bodies the manifestation but not about the Creator what is this body who is working through the body how this is growing and then decaying and then passing away again the new form is coming which is constantly going on inside we don't know but that is called spirituality to know that truth here is the Shiva who is transcendent quite but from there only the power is coming and the manifestation is the imminent now when you see in the war now in the different tvs they are showing that the fight is going on in the Middle East all the soldiers they are doing all the pictures that is coming of the soldiers they are going there shooting than the armed car and all those things but are they really powerful these soldiers these people all these machineries there is someone he is taking the decision he is telling yes then it is fighting stop stopping we don't know him when the reports are coming they don't go over there similarly it is an example that we see all the time something behind and all things are going on here also it is the Shiva and is the agent he is the main who is creating these and the Shakti is imminent the cosmic manifestation of the Shakti ease however Ian essence is the manifestation of the Shiva himself is the manifestation of the Sheba this is the creation the moment we know the secret of creation the definition of the creation according to the Tantra it is the Sheba who is the main manifesting the whole everything in different names and forms but it is the same Sheba what will happen now I am a Shiva bhakta I am a devotee of Shiva and I go and worship Shiva and I know the Shiva is having five phases I know she was having different deforms and all those things one lady was telling me that is it possible to again give her special discourse and Tantra and some time yet the Shiv ratri the shivarathri is approaching her in the time of her artery Shiva is the main Tantra Idol okay now that the Shiva we know Shiva we are the lovers of Sheba we worship Shiva but these same Shiva is manifested with each and everything that Zoe bhagwan swami vivekananda when he was giving a talk in the South India because they are all very Orthodox we use the word Orthodox means a little narrow minded and then don't like to think anything else except those ideas that they have already formed the day go to the temple and before going to the temple that you care they always take the Holy baths and then change their clothes then in a very good way they will go and all those so call high caste people higher caste people they go and so-called I used the word so-called lower caste how do you know the lower costs and higher costs maybe a lower caste born so-called workers born a grown up in a higher caste family he is accepted as the higher cost how do you know that maybe there isn't change in the hospital after the birth what will happen so all this that we think is a wrong conception is the mind of the human being but anyway they always go they always think that it is their only privilege to go nobody else should go and this is the god you have to worship whether the people are hungry outside they are dying still you should go and pour the milk on the head of the Shiva and all these things are we be wakin on the seed the living shivers are dying all around and you are worshipping this so that is the way we're from he said out of emotion no not at all and he said with the philosophy what is the philosophy Sheba has taken different forms so go and serve the Shiva in gville the jiva means the individual so serve the Shiva the eminent in de the in the imminent jeevers the transcendent Shiva so this is that way they said in the book bhagavad-gita it is actually in the bed anta that has been in a wonderful way in a small form condensed form whole Vedanta comes in the bhagavad-gita 15 chapter very fast luca is give again explain the pedantic way of manifestation what is this he said who the moolam utter shock on Ash watham Prager abhayam chand OMSI SI par nany y esta vida subida be one who can understand this understand the beta understanding the whole beta it says understanding the whole beta how by understanding the creation what is the creation the order moolam the root is in there up it says eternal ash whatta a shutter is a tree is a rooted a bar and branching below whose leaves are the waiters Vedas means the knowledge now he who knows it is the knower of the way that the knower of the beta means you have to understand that all this creation is nothing but the manifestation of the same consciousness when you understand that realize that try to understand that how can you be narrow-minded how can you be jealous how can you can you be angry with others how can you fight with others it's not possible so the religion is always the good which is helping us to develop all the best qualities that human mind can achieve so this is the sea and the Vedanta it says that said carrier bada satkaryavada let's call samkhya samkhya philosophy the cause is hidden into its effects and if it is just a transformation of the cause there's called satkaryavada SAT means the eternal Korea the Kriya the work the bother the theory satkaryavada what is that the cause from where the creation is coming is hidden I am discussing it because the Ramakrishna said the the broad minded people the devotee who are liberal minded they should accept everything at the same time holding their own chosen deity chosen god thats cool Ishta devatha now why he said that so we caught it from the Tantra the Shiva is the only creation and Sheba is creating himself then we find over here in the bhagavad-gita the same thing it says only those who can understand these that all this manifested being different names and forms are nothing but the same consciousness whom we call as Brahman art one it's a great knowledge so when we understand that that is called be the beat and you need not to understand anything else that is the ultimate that's called be the hunter here again is a technology technical words they're using satkaryavada where South Korea means shanky philosophy explaining cause is hidden into his effects effect is just the transformation of the cause satkaryavada it gives the another connect the concept pari na moi de polynomially tlie transforming what is that some people they think that when a milk is converted into yogurt is the yogurt not the milk again so South Korea sought the God has transformed into this world now it is the world only there is no God cannot be because the God has transformed itself into this world like the milk transform into the yogurt now we cannot find milk if you say teka take out the milk out from the yogurt it is not possible it is already been so that is called pari na mo bother it is completely transformed sao paulo nama but Shankara said no it is not it cannot be that God cannot be transform permanently in different ship different form different name different entity it is not so what is it it says be birthda bother as Eve superimposition so purina movado means evolution and be worth to bother means superimposition be Bertha is just changing but who is changing not that bad thing but my mind is changing sometimes in the Dirk when you are walking over these carpets you think that all the decoration is totally different something has happened maybe someone pour the water so it may be at the soaked in water you go and touch you know it is not but just because of the shadow and the conception and all these you think in that way it happened to me so you went and tested or no it is not because when there is darkness a little light is coming as confusing it is not changed it is as it is but I am thinking it has been changed so I am super imposing my thought only thing which is in reality no change so that is called be worth the bother these are the two the terminologies of the Vedanta satkaryavada and from the satkaryavada it says pari na ma vada and according to Shankar Acharya the purina ma father actually be worth the bother but we accept the Shankara point of view this God has manifested into so many different forms in English they call it pantheism all is God and another word pan n theism panentheism all in God the all cannot be God we are thinking all our God that means everything is god no oh god everything in God so that is the thing sometimes they give the example the waves of the ocean are not the ocean the waves of the ocean they are in the ocean they are forming in the ocean but they are not the ocean so that is the way we have to understand all that forms that we see that God has manifested but how it is not in a Pauline amo bother evolution the complete and aim but we birthed about the superimposition and all the people that's why in Christianity rewind the conception of Holy Ghost the God cannot transform so he has seen his main image his son into the world to spread the message of God between the person the Jesus the Son of God is there in this world he cannot directly communicate with the god so is coming through the Holy Ghost that is the conception here also if the God is transforming then there will be no God so this is these dos the ramakrishna mentioned only one sentence but it has a very deep meaning now just to understand the creation it says from the supreme consciousness brahman comes the maya and the Maya covers a portion of the consciousness and it transformed to ishwara Maya OOP ajita Chaitanya Chayton demeans the consciousness OOP ajita covered covered by war chaitanya the basic is the chaitanya now we say that when we are preparing the sweet the inside the sweet we put something which is a different thing but the very good taste and cover that with something else maybe Maya so the Maya when covering something and then we are giving it to some people they're eating it and they are appreciating it that is called Maya oppa heater chilton near the consciousness consciousness covered by Maya is the issue Allah that supreme Brahman is not creating supreme Brahman out of itself is projecting producing a power that's called Maya the name of that particular power and this power again covering a portion of the consciousness and creating ishwara this is conception of each other and then ashura is creating again the jeevers the individuals then what are those jeepers now it says ego covered that consciousness the consciousness covered by the ego is the giba consciousness covered by the Maya is the issue error now the jiva and the issue Jeeva is trying to go to the ashura ashura means God we know the alicia is the creator all that we're trying to reach where you sure what is the issue is me only how I can be because I am also consciousness and the God is also consciousness then what is the condition he is gone super imposed by the maya i am super imposed by the ego is also maya but different type so the ego covering consciousness is the cheeba and from that OOP ajita chaitanya ashura creates the world the issuer who is the covered by the Maya but the consciousness creating the world first he created the five certain elements that is ether air fire water earth this puncher punch a puta shitty apathy is mereth boom but not the gross is not the water that we can drink it is not the fire that we can we can understand it is the subtle condition of that then from the Maya it comes the ether from the ether that is the year here is coming and from the year is the water and from a ham well from the water again this Akasha bio bio agni agni Abraha up oprah three pretty biam oshadi aha these are the file acha shot by you first is the ETA da Booma then the bayou the air and from the Bayou comes by ogni the fire from the agony up aha from the fire comes the water and from the water it is the art and in the art again all visitation and when the visitation than all other g was so this is the Cystic chroma according to the vedanta particularly shanker rancor is giving this example in this way it is created bakuman see ramakrishna he is telling that i am in a peculiar state of mind he is explaining about himself i am in a peculiar state of mind my mind constantly descends from the absolute to the relative and again essence from the relative to the absolute and it is going up and coming down it really very very special when after long long practices maybe life up to life someone is practicing that's called Maha Purusha maha yogi they somehow ass into that consciousness and never come back they never come back so that is only one time but here is a person just to the nurse bhagwan cinema krishna he so easily he is telling so simply he's telling that my mind is coming down to the relative and from the relative ascending to the absolute so that is called Barbra muga in Sanskrit that condition of the mind called barber Mucca Mucca means the MA mouth the face and power idea the conception the bhava mukha when the all his realization was over then us thinking I have already realized what is the truth there why should I survived why should i leave for what then because i know this world is nothing illusory then why should i leave like this when we are playing with the toys and slowly slowly growing up growing up and growing up then a grown-up person leaves those toys and say enough of all these all this nonsense I don't need to play with that children under that psychology they are so much interested to play with those things the toys but the grown-up people they will never like to sit over there to play with the toys why because of the experience it is natural similarly those who have already realized God already understood the reality of this world they will say why I should be here ceramic ISNA after the array realization he thought why not give up the body I am going to leave over here or is the purpose of living when he was thinking in this way suddenly from the or a white smoke started appearing and that happened induction Asia in the room where's to stay just injured before the room he was lying on the space is there he was sitting and thinking he saw the white smoke is coming out and slowly taking a form of a face a big place long beard white here and he said you must leave in parvo mukha it's a big chapter if you read that the biography of sayama krishna written by Xiaomi Saladin and the ji maharaj that has been translated into American English by chetan anand the G so if you read that book a chapter is there on the Baba mukha there's a special condition of Baba mocha and it says that my mind constantly decent from the absolute to the relative and again it ascends from the relative to the absolute when we sit for meditation what we do actually we try to make our mind reach to the higher level so we try to ascent from the relative to the absolute mind is going and thinking so many other things then again we are bringing back the mind and concentrating on one particular point particular image and then slowly forgetting trying to forget my own personality my own body own surroundings and slowly going up to the spiritual level here ceramic ashna say it was so easy the attainment of the absolute is called knowledge of Brahman but it is extremely difficult to acquire extremely difficult to acquire a man cannot acquire the knowledge of Brahman unless he completely reads himself of his attachment to the world so this is ultimate thing secret of success giving away the whole world and what is this world actually if we go on giving the list it is impossible on ending list but in one word it can be said Ohama meaty ah hum I mama ET and mine me and mine that is the whole world and from this me and mind all different things have come if i can give away the me and what is the me again salam o Krishna pinpointed that in sterling this is the ego the ego when goes away I am I am but we do not know who is this i am when i am claiming that i am but what is this I that he doesn't know that is the ignorance the moments we can go back to that particular source what happens we become that Brahman because that is the true nature but this is very very difficult extremely difficult because you have to go beyond this then he says the manifold has come from the one alone the relative from the absolute again when God changes the state of my mind he is explaining about himself when he brings my mind down to the plane of the relative I perceived that it is he who has become these the Creator the Maya the living beings and these universe he is the master and the universe and all its living beings belong to him alone that is the knowledge and I am the door I am the Guru I am the father that is ignorance and with this he says as long as you do not feel that God is the master you must come back to the world you must be bored again and again there will be no rebirth when you can truly say o God thou are the master the win we take this human former whatever forms we suffer why because that is the natural thing whatever is created is going to be destroyed today or tomorrow jayati asti birth date a pepperoni or mati bipasha it maria the-- these are the six changes that has been found and noticed by the people of brahma gana burma knowledge xiety is born asti it is then remaining but that it is growing like they're ultimately it goes to depth so from the bird and the date that is the circle completing again birth not that the aft of the Dead everything is over another form another name recycling so it goes on recycling you cannot stop it it's not the one time is over so that is the reason the more the moment you have we have taken this body the birds they're also suffering and the animals the insects and the human being higher grid of human being all are suffering why because the moment you are taking the form and thinking that this form is me suffering and there is no other way ultimate is this but what is the Buddha they've said that is his knowledge good the said ultimately this is all suffering to come to come sarvam dukem the oh the birth of the birth everything is full of misery misery and misery and it has the cause what is that cause desire and then you can go beyond these there's a possibility how by giving up the desire how to give the desire give up the desire then he gives the eight formula eight steps or this way this way this way this way so here also see Ramakrishna said unless and until you offer o God thou are the master as long as you cannot say o lord thou alone art real he will not be released from the life of the world this going on and coming going and coming this birth and the inevitable birth is inevitable there will be no liberation further what can you achieve by saying it is mine now he is giving an example and most of the time we say this is mine this is mine ya mera head this is mine now he is giving an example and very wonderful example he said there was a manager used to look after the state of a rich man and the manager is to say this is our girl this is our couches and this is our furniture is all made up best dude he is to feel proud then suddenly he was dismissed one day as they called fired and the master gave him one box made of mango mango mango wood is the worst type of wood and even he was not having the capacity to take that box because it was given by the master to him he cannot take it so when we say that this is my tower this is my building this is my these days this one day will come in Hindi they say in the couplet 18 a cola de naga sub kuch lee jayega a black day will come black moment will come everything will be taken away from you you cannot hold anything this is so true everyone every moment we are realizing it but still that is called the Maya are we listen to it we go beyond this door immediately forget something begin cover up our mind and so again we are thinking owner we have to do this and that but that is called Maya the feeling I and mine has covered the reality ceramic ISNA is concluding the feeling I and mine has covered the reality because of these we do not see the truth attainment of chaitanya divine consciousness is not possible without the knowledge of advaitha Advaita means oneness na duita or Twitter no negative no to so one the one means Advaita fiscal non-duality after realizing chaitanya chetana means the consciousness one enjoys nithyananda then after realizing that reaching over there what we get continuous joy Nithyananda continuous joy and eternal bliss one enjoys this please after attending the state up paramahamsa he is indicating about his condition is a another conception perama hamsa hamsa means the Swan the paramahamsa it is in the water but at the same time not belongs to the water water cannot wait it it goes anytime dry so leaving this world but completely free of any attachment that is called paramahamsa condition having all relations but at the same time completely detest not affected by anything of this world called paramahamsa do you know what the vision of divine consciousness is lie it now a very important thing that he is mentioning I almost very casually do you know what the vision of divine consciousness when the vision of consciousness comes do we always think about some of the vision many people they come over here and they share their different type of experiences I saw these i saw there yesterday one gentleman game you are stilling but the consciousness what is the vision of consciousness ceramic ISNA said it is like sarden illumination of a dark room when a match is struck the moment that is lighted and no darkness immediately everything every corner all light that is called a consciousness where the moment they come to know that everything is nothing but the God just imagine how we can see how we can feel that is the moment that is called the supreme consciousness the sudden illumination of a Dirk room thank you very much we will again continue this discussion about the Incarnation and other philosophies let us conclude with this mantra again need an genom medium an entire bum bogdana compa Drita be grumpy yavitt arum para Misha medium-term ramakrishna meeeee Shira sana mama ooh Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that SAT Sri Ramakrishna are eponymous to whatever you do
