[54: Panchama Veda 54: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC7liI1ukvU)

it is begin after offering our pranaam terbuka Tom rhythm top dodgy venom Kobe be rewritten Calma shop ahom Savannah mangalam srimad artham boo Bakunin te buried ayana why we can't see God that was the question we were discussing someone asked and raghavan see ramakrishna is replying why we can't see God and different points he is telling different explanation he is giving if there is dark then in on the water then you have to apply the purifying agent then only you can see the clear water and you can see your reflection then again he is telling one cannot seize one's face in a mirror if the mirror is covered with dirt so that is the thing where we are going to see God realize God within our mind inside our mind we can see God mind is our mirror but why we can't see that over our mind dots are there what are those darts comic road are low bar etc it begins with a hum gaara ego complete ego I am doing it I can do it like that the tremendous ego that is covering that mirror and we cannot see the reflection of God a reflection of Earthmen our real image our identity that is God but what we can do we can purify it how we can purify it now haga van see Ramakrishna he is giving that one after another very simple suggestions how we can purify this first and foremost he is telling seek the company of holy men second practice prayer this prayer is very very important with faith when we are praying to God and particularly Tucker is telling to Shami g that tuesday and saturday today is Tuesday Tuesday and Saturday have very very good days if you can go and pray to God God means he was mentioning the mother divine mother then your prayer will be answered fulfilled the prayer means fasting that we have to have the faith God is there he will listen to or she will listen to me and then I will go and open up my mind so different type of prayers are there Sosa ramakrishna's is telling practice prayer is so difficult to pray even we do not know how to pray so sometimes he is teaching us have complete faith just like a small child and cry to God the moment you are crying then the God will surely listen that faith when I am crying like a child and listen to the instruction of the guru now he is telling listen to the instruction of the GUI a person who is holy who is constantly thinking for the betterment of others who is not having any selfish motive he is the only person and if he is giving you some instruction follow it that will be good for you so he's telling have firm belief afterwards firm belief that God is father a mother the relation between a father and the mother every child he feels secured the child will secure with the mother with the father so that's why Sri Ramakrishna is teaching first you have to have the company of the holy people there that means the people who are unselfish and whose life is dedicated for the development betterment of the others then practice prayer then when constantly we are going on praying and sometimes we made out easily really listening so that way we may think then we may forget to pray and no you have to go on praying and pray in such a way as if he is standing and you were going and demanding like a small little kid demanding things and listen to the instruction of the Guru then have firm faith believe then with the faith of a child pray to divine father mother I have committed scene but I won't repeat them in different times ramakrishna stealing go and confess what is that confession yeah I have done some mistakes I have done some scene committed scene but I own repeat it that's all just look at it how he is solving the great philosophy huge philosophy that is creating the so many thousands of people they are thinking how to do this Easterling simply go and tell I am sorry I won't repeat it you are free why because you have the complete faith the moment you have the faith in God then you are free chant God's name and purify your body and mind this is the ultimate thing chanting the name of God constantly repeating the name of God constantly and that is the reason in all religion they always repeat the name of God in Christianity in Buddhism in Islam of course in Hinduism and mundra deeksha unless and until you are taking the mantra deeksha they say your body and mind cannot be purified why because you are not taking the name of God you are not repeating the name of God so that is the reason chant God's name and purify your body and mind raghavan see Ramakrishna is telling this and we find in the Sri no yo male is declaring this is in Arabic davila roberta village is a very good Scripture maman nominal okish mean lokesh mean in this world loka world ash mean this mama nominee my name my name God's name shraddha yah with faith yes to get ahead he who is repeating or narrating or describing the Holy Name of God in this world the co-op arado coat is too even the clothes and close the millions of his seen his mistakes his follies shaam amoeba it is all pardoned now some Shia don't have any doubt about this see this is the hurry bhakti in the vishnu yo mala and he is telling that in that book is telling that if you are repeating the gods name on spreading the gods name or narrating the gods name with a face that these will benefit you so you're all your sins will be pardoned let me tell you one thing ceramic richness telling God can be seen of course the Vedas say that God is beyond mind and speech as in the Veneti defined yet obaachan everton take appropriate manassas aha in a very political language it says you cannot explain nerrit God the Brahman the art Minh / markman because it is beyond time-space causation so naturally the moment you are trying to explain the god that is Brahman who is beyond time-space causation you can never that's why in a poetic language history the mana nibert thanthi coming back between to observe you into survey then it was thinking that it will explain yeto barcher the words new burton tea coming back a proper without realizing without understanding without getting mana saha with the mind mind and the speech as if this to they went to understand what is God but without understanding anything they're coming back in another place it says a bomb menasha bochurim bong and manasseh ago cherub go chura means known ago Chara unknown to whom to the words to the mind you can never fathom you can never have that idea of God but still some of the people they will be telling God is like this God has formed Oh God has no form God is like this God is not like that how can they say that it is impossible to tell that impossible to say like that the Vagabond see Rama Krishna is very perfect he is telling not according to the Vedanta but if you purify your mind then it that mind you can see God if you purify your mind here you we are using the mind mana Mon should thoroughly if the mind is purified how the mind can be purified then he said and again we find that in the bhagavata this is very important in the whole of religion what is there the thing is only we have to purify our mind we come over here we meditate we read scripture we try to do as best good work for what for the realization of God to get the blessings of God but by all these things what actually happening purifying our mind what is impurity selfishness what is purity unselfishness and how we can be unselfish by thinking of God hearing about God repeating the Holy Name of God and this is so simple and it is applicable to anyone and we are making watertight depart compartments this is my religion you cannot enter and that is your religion I will never go all this actually not knowing what is the purpose of religion if the medicine is not curing then you what is the use of taking the medicine if the books cannot give us the knowledge done is the use of reading that book if the water cannot quench our thirst then what is the fan of drinking water and similarly if we cannot understand God then why should we practice religion so these are the things that we have to the first goal is to realize God why we are practicing religion to realize God how we can realize God first thing having the faith that God is there a ceramic ISNA is telling let me tell you one thing God can be seen you can see God anyone can see God then some people will come and say the ladies cannot do it only the James how do you know that it's just because he has also not seen God so he do not know what is what simply imposing so that is the way only we are imposing something in the name of God because we want to control people rule people get benefit from some troop by utilizing religion and white ceramic Krishna is so unique because he has come to give the perfect knowledge about religion here he's never mentioned that only brahmana should draw by sure nothing like that male female nothing like that any difference of language or religion or caste creed nothing like that God can be seen and anyone who is having the pure mind can see the same thing we hear from the jesus also the purity of heart they say that those who are pure in art now what is the purity of heart this how we can do that bhagavad is telling rabbonim Keith onam wish no smaranam father's even archana meeeeee bond onam das IAM sockem art mana be the num ultimate art- be Donna the first is hearing Robin just today out of curiosity I was checking and I found more than 200 people they are observing this class but they do not come over here maybe that because of the distance and I but see they are interest so this bunch of aveda they're all listening they are hearing because it is light stream is going on it is nowadays that system is there but I am afraid that someday I have to speak from my room only and you will be in your own rooms will be having the classes so that way the whole thing is changing i went to speak in a school but the principal he was not liking me because all the students and the teachers they were showing lot of respect and interest sir perhaps she didn't like it and she told sami g you need not to take the trouble of going to the classes or in that auditorium hall you can sit over here and speak into the microphone so the people all students will listen they have that system in all classrooms they are having that system but the thing is you don't get inspiration to speak if you don't have that audience before you so the reaction is also necessary it is only for this but it apart from that thing is through Bernama that is very very important unless and until you are listening you won't have the understanding the more you are listening the more it is getting clear to you shravana then after listing that to go on musing over that you have to discuss over that kill tanam unless and until you they have that I went to a place Alabama Alabama is a big place the particular small the township I have forgotten but that name I was telling so many devotees that there to start one they are very very interested start a study circle with anther studies out and going on ribbiting so many times I told do I really have any benefit out of that no personal benefit not that i am going to increase our number of devotees not with that also only I believe the words of yvonne sri ramakrishna i believe the words of chaitanya mahaprabhu used to go on singing the name of God hari Krishna Hari Krishna and sometimes he'll be telling i will give you so many things if you only want you repeat the name of God and that way he was tempting those please repeat the ones at once only that will do you know the story there were two very notorious person jagai and madhai and every time there will be some villains will be there the jag imma they were the villains they were creating problem for the good people the beating them looting them like that even they had a fight with the chaitanya mahaprabhu's beloved friend nick t ananda and when the chaitanya mahaprabhu came to know about these he was very angry and he was a very powerful person but the nit turn on the told they are ignorant they don't know if you don't go and bless them they are going to hell please bless them so he was going and telling his friend his god chaitanya mahaprabhu please come with me don't be angry with them have compassion bless them and they were blessing this jag imma die this is a wonderful story we find like this then Raghavan buddha also blessing that angle amal but once the ramakrishna also blessing that another one this type of thought was there in calcutta monmouth ha so he was blessed by bhagavan sri ramakrishna so this way we here shrivenham kill tanam kill Tina means the moment you are repeating the name of God first you are hearing you are liking if you don't like you will never repeat that the moment you are liking means your samskara all your the past lives good work manifesting expressing and naturally you started liking the name of God and then you are repeating chanting it is not katana means doesn't mean go on only singing no discussion sitting together you are reading the book then discussing about among yourselves and then talking with about that to your friend so like that bish no means God then sharanam remembering a continuously remembering that is why taking the name of Lord diksha helping to remember God because the Guru say you go on counting the name of God when you are not on the seat in particular doesn't matter anywhere you are just take the name of God so remembering sharanam passive annum bother saving him physically you are solving god swami vivekananda the disciple of see Rama Krishna who is nothing but see Rama Krishna himself in another form he is telling that service to Manny service to God gb preme courageous John if you are loving the people you are actually serving the Shiva the Lord when we are going to those people who are not very well-off helping them in different way sometime encouraging them sometime educating them sometime giving them meditate medicine sometimes giving them some other health so that is also father save annum you are directly serving the god My gods are those by whom by mistake you call as men my special object of worship special objective worship the downtrodden the illiterate the oppressed swami ji stealing and so many other people are also there may be they are educated maybe they're financially well-off may be well placed in the society but you are suffering they don't have the peace in their mind helping them also bothers a venom whom I am actually solving that's why see Ramakrishna said who are you to help you yourself don't know and you are thinking that you can help no you can do saver that Siva and serum swami vivekananda he all took this in another step and it will pooja you must have to do that we are you are the porter ease of living gods and goddesses the voter is of living gods and goddesses in the west where everything is taken care of by the government welfare government no beautifully planned there we are serving the living gods by talking with them giving this type of wonderful teachings of our ancient time so that is also service and the places where they need the physical health there we are going and helping them and this this way swami vivekananda he has developed one machinery and beautifully he is giving the opportunity each and every one to serve the living gods how a group of monks and nuns they don't have their own personal family or anything no attachment so they are coming out serving the living gods and the devotees the householders who cannot give up their duties and responsibilities they help them monetarily or otherwise and both are getting the same result married by doing this work and that is the beauty of the introduction of Shaba yoga karma yoga by sharma vivek remember it's not just we are going and helping some people because they're in distress we are serving the living God's father save annum this is in the Bhagavad it says and then sin or chineham worship about his worship also show me Vivek understanding and that very Orthodox among the Orthodox people in South India Madras and that too before a temple and he said go over there inside the temple there is a God but I tell unto you before the temple he is telling go over there you see the living God's over there the same God who is in the temple in an image stone image you do not know whether he is accepting your archon or not pooja or not your service or not the poor the downtrodden people give them education give them food give them clothings and help them in any way possible so that they can stand on their own feet and believe that the God behind me inside the temple will be happy there's a wonderful lecture I am NOT quoting verbatim but if you read that lecture very very inspiring and that is practical religion practical Vedanta or chonnam here muley millions of dollars we are spending and offering it to God in the stone image not knowing actually whether it is really been done or not because if you go to the temples sometimes I doubt the people who are worshiping are they really devoted the way they are trying the flowers on the dead body of this the image of god and goddesses can they really do like that when that the arm was kept inside that art at a yoga Don and people who are slowly putting the art over that covering that ramakrishna nanda ji maharaj who is to serve see ramakrishna personally he cried out don't throw in that way it will hurt occur so that is called la he is completely believing 100% believing taco ruiz there is not just a small box having his relics in it now is God himself don't throw those in that fashion it may hard taco he cried out that that is called or chonnam then one dunham vandana means chanting suppose you were talking with your friends and relatives sometimes raise the topic of God tell them some of the good quotations tell them somewhat you experienced when you visited the society belong to society what type of lectures that you were hearing that he is also bund onam because you are yourself getting that same knowledge once again repeated then showing humbleness das IAM this is very very important when you go to the temple and we give lot of donation and then some time afterwards when you visit that all our relatives are also going they'll be telling this has been done by my grandfather these that God cannot accept that so humbleness is the great thing gaseum so many people is to bring so many other things to bhagawan sri ramakrishna he'll be keep that keep that over there and then you will talk to them and he will be trying to impress that God can be seen you can serve God butthole to trip hold the truth don't do anything wrong so that way he used to guide them the God himself and that is the way we should build our life so when we are going when you were working when we are serving as volunteers as among dedicated one we must be careful that in no way we should heart salam o Krishna whoever is coming he is welcome whoever it wants to bring something he's welcome Who am I to say no God may have maybe that suddenly he failed that he should bring something I cannot say know how I know that it is God's will or not so that's why we have to say okay bring it keep it over here whether he will accept it or not that is up to God I do not know but we should not say that no not this time of that time so this is the humbleness the Gaussian then suck him feeling very close with God god-fearing person in English they say when a person ever devotee he loves God in English they will be describing god-fearing person why should I feel God I should I be afraid of God so I say never God loving person we love God so we have every right to go and talk to him tell him these that this is the problem that is the thing because I feel that he is my friend this circum and ultimately art MonaVie dhanam when you are offering pranaam that ISNA be Donna Oh God I have nothing to give to you accept this mind and soul please accept it please take it what I can offer you nothing but please accept me as your own heart MonaVie denim sravanam kirtanam Bishnoi smaranam pedasi venom archana vandanam das IAM subcomm at MonaVie denim and chandeleur bhakti Sutra it says that Tavia pavitram epic ramat Tavia by this Pavitra purity book remark generates every time jesus ramkrishna scripture be pure be pure be pure what is purity the love of God unselfishness how to generate that these are the things we were quoting bhagavan sri ramakrishna we were quoting the hora bhakti balázs we were quoting barber and we know that by this way and there feeling that these are the things if you practice then your mind will be purified raghavan a raja maharaja waar brahmananda G C ramakrishna's disciple is to consider him as his son he say if you read one chapter of bhagavad-gita every day your mind will be purified see so many suggestions are there if you are doing like this chant one chapter of the bhagavad-gita but simply somehow or other we are reading sometimes I also do because when there is no time just brushing like that but if you can read and think the meaning of it of the words to naturally those meanings of the words will reflect in your mind purify your mind and Mara demonee debbie is telling never stopped taking the name of God you see God has given you so many pubs between your finger markings on your finger wife to keep the counting go on counting the name of God I have seen one sharmaji he used to read and write all vedanta books but he has to take the name of God constantly you'll never stop in patna when he was there I used to just observe the senior show me how they're leaving so naturally that way you can get the inspiration you can learn from them I saw him in the morning he will come out nearby devotees will come and offer pranaam and they would be chatting something and they will be giving some information like there was an accident here the road is they are broadening here this thing is that thing and he will take all information is it is it only one word he say is it and then that person he is going on telling giving the information and the show me keeping his hand inside that under the CH other the cover going on counting the name of God and when he is eating also he is counting the name of God in the left hand I saw him and then met him in Himmel I I so constantly taking the name of God so ice and then get ananda ji maharaj constantly taking the name of God you know he was the vice president of our order my god this type of people constant they can take that top haha by that by taking the name of God listening to him chanting about him talking about God you purify your mind Tapia by that pavitra mopic ramat you get the practice devotion to God one gets purity raghavan see Ramakrishna he is telling in khatam Rita in another part will find maybe assure anam cara tar kuja when you are repeating the name of God that is his pooja that is his worship if you want to do the worship only take the name of God that is sufficient so look at it the paraphernalia all these things that we do that is for our satisfaction but the real war she is take the name of God and that is sufficient so the more we are understanding this religion the more we become in drawn and taking the name of God then external things in bhagavad-gita say Krishna is telling young yanam Jabberjaw Guiche me raghavan see Ramakrishna he is talking with other devotees he is telling a man becomes liberated even in this life when he knows that God is the doer of all things only one thing that's all and he will realize God in this life itself so so many people are doing so many things but this is so simple what we have to do only only we have to understand and understand sincerely that God is the doer I am only a machine then he is telling a man becomes liberated even in this life when he knows that God is the doer of all things in bhagavad-gita also the same thing when the urge una is giving the argument and having their long conversation with Shri Krishna shri krishna said wat you do not know i have already done everything only you are going to repeat that that's all I like to see you doing that but it has already been done when we do something we think that we have all we are doing it but it has already been done only with the blessings of god i am getting the opportunity to show it before them at the one person he is coming on the stage and acting like a king and behaving just kingly way and people are clapping but they do not know the script whatever dial up that was uttering the script was written by someone and how he should move on the stage how you should look how he should take out the sword how he should behave Oh everything was trained by someone and then someone dressed him just like he came so that he will look like that he was having long here than big monsters and these and that everything only he came on the dash because he is a lucky person to get that that's all and here we've also I had a big doctor big engineer big administrator Big D's with that everybody is freezing but the thing is we got the opportunity the script was written by God himself he dressed us like that he put us over the duck and now only one thing if I forget that someone is there at the back then the director if you are insulting the director he will never call you back for another show and the hero will become zero if the director is not calling and now he is not getting the opportunity zero so that we see seen so many times in the history in the society in our daily lives in our household life we see so many people they are becoming successful but suddenly they become so egoistic when they come down it is applicable for an individual life and societies life and a country's live walls when a society become very egoistic they become destroyed we are the only Aryans and we are here to rule so many people did toward that is all in the history one after another the Roman Eagle the it is to everywhere on the world Roman Eagle thousands and thousands following the Romans we're up they now mostly bankrupt the nowhere in the small room and country nowhere and then came one after another where are they nowhere because the society became very arrogant and they started torturing over others and by that they are distancing themselves from the God and then they got the punishment everybody is suffering each and everyone is suffering the whole of Europe what they did on the Asia and Africa that history and they had to suffer in the first Second World War so we have to understand we think in a different way but the spiritual insight if we can judge why these there are points in the history those who are in the students they'll be writing the cause of Crow fall of Roman Emperor they will become what are the causes they will write the neighbor right that a Model T is also one of the causes the torture and others also one of the causes because they don't see that history the incidence through the spiritual insight the Saddam o Krishna is telling a man only have to think that God is the doer of all things once a shop came here with some womanly remember alec is a very rich person in case rob was very famous I said to him to catch up not even a leaf moves except by the wheel of God ceramic ish knees to loves ketchup very much so he wanted to protect keshab from the hand of this mistake the ego when a person is getting the clapping he forgets everything so that is the reason say Ramakrishna wanted to protect him by telling him you see without the permission of God even a dry leaf cannot move that means indicating the one of our young Swami he was a very good speaker and he was original thought was there is not that he will simply he'll be always analyzing things and the like very good books at there also he wrote and I went with him after his lecture all people came and in Bengal you know they will be touching the feet of the schwa me and they where everyone was telling swami ji you spoke so well Momiji spoke soil and he was ringing oh yes or you like that you are stealing the old Xiaomi she noticed from inside the room he was sitting he came and told do you know these people tell the same thing to every speaker don't think that you are the only these devotees they will be telling the same thing praising the speaker to every speaker not don't think that you are the only one getting displaced listening the when you are returning you are stealing he is correct that is the devotee they are supposed to tell like that and they really like it they express it but the person who is receiving so many thus people coming and telling him that you are good you are good it goes into his head he start things in the I am that good then afterwards earthly he finds that he is the only one left no one around so that is the reason that one should be very very careful God he only doing and that even not a leaf moves expect by except by the will of God where is the man's free will he is talking about that I used to say ceramic is ms teaching therefore I say Oh mother I am the machine and Dow are the operator amijaan through to me gently the gentle means the operator genre is the machine I am only the machine but I am so happy that you are using me as your machine and then again he is telling i am the chariot and thou art the driver the driver is driving the chariot and in a wonderful fashion but i am blessing that you are sitting on me and then driving me I move as thou movers me I do as thou makest me do when sharma vivek on the American disciples they were all planning how to spread the message of Vedanta how to organize and they're very well-planned people so naturally they were wondering why a farm if you become is not having any plan he'll be telling we have to do this we have to do that but no planning / and these people they were not understanding why from then once he said show me G we have to make the plan and accordingly we had to work swami ji said i never make plans i only do my mother's work whatever their order is coming to me from divine I just played it when she will ask me the Divine Mother or Raghavan see Ramakrishna will ask me to do it I will do it but I don't make the planning but Swamiji of course he said that is a spiritual way he is telling but Shami G again he is telling that you must learn the administration from these people from American West how they are organizing things to perfectly again and again he told our society if you have to make a perfect society have to learn from them so many planning should be there they know what is going to happen after say 50 years and planning will be like that so this is the thing we have to learn but about the spiritual progress salam o Krishna is telling everything inside him can be seen through his eyes a person entered into sluggishness room a devotee from London bark as a place entered the room with his frames ceramic is sitting with the devotee the master looked at him and say look at it Master marshes is writing it down why to give a picture of ceramic business who is he ceramic is not looked at him and immediately said everything inside him can be seen through his eyes can be seen who can see accepts Adama Krishna as one sees the objects in a room through a glass door so that means all of us we were coming before see Ramakrishna he knows ins and outs he can see us what we are so we cannot hide anything before him but if we are simple and then we can go to him and tell I am like this only but please accept me what I shall do because I don't have the strength to rectify myself I don't have the strength to do all those things to purify myself but I know one thing that you are my father you were my mother if you are holding my hand I will never fall so I have that faith what other things are wrong but one faith so that will be sufficient so this way then someone was telling master Masha he was telling Victor sugar is very angry with God and with a shagger he is a big jajaja use the ocean of learning badash a girl once said what is the use of calling God just think of the incident at one time Cheng is khan he plundered the country and imprisoned many people and the number of prisoners rose to about 100,000 the commander in his army said to him your majesty who will feed them it is risky to keep them with us it will be equally dangerous to release them because they are the enemy what shall I do the Ching jeez can say that's true what can be done well them killed 100,000 people who had killed and Cheng is decorated all that dead bodies in and just like a the monument so that was the contribution then jinkies consider that now God saw the big discoveries angry with God coating from the history is telling now God saw the slander and at slaughter didn't he but he didn't stop it in any way therefore I don't need God whether he exists or not I don't drive any good it don't drive any good from him that is with the shell so they educated people it doesn't mean that once you were educated and he is educated in Sanskrit and he is educated in English he is educated in so many other subjects in New so many things the Scriptures but no faith a ceramic ISNA enabling to school a tremendous weight because through his sadhana he realized God within him and he is telling is it possible to understand God's action and his motive he creates he preserves and he destroys can you ever understand why he destroys that is the thing when a person is developing the spirituality if he is motivated by seeing the all around the social things he will develop in society life but cannot realize God the wind that freedom movement in India was going on some of our young do Brahma charians one of the Brahma cherry who is to do that he afterwards he became the president of arduous task Rama he was a very good swarming and he told you see when we were young many of our Brahma cherries we were in Madras mod we were excited that something we must do against the British shirts we should go and fight against the Britishers but now we have become Ramachari now early morning her to get up and do all this Japan cetera anyway by night when all the sleeping we will skill the the wall go and at least do some wall writing against the British errs if we cannot do anything else at least this much so some of the four or five young bromwich errands when all are sleeping they used to go and then there's two right and the wall one day the ones that in charge Swami he understood he called them and say you cannot be in two boats swami vivekananda was a great lover of india he was a patriot saint but when he formed the monastic organization he said for you this politics and development of the society is not for you it is only God and God loan concentrate your mind on god if you like to do this type of patriotic job patriotic thing you're welcome but leave this monastic life then some of them afterwards they left the monastic life and join the fray of the freedom fight but this Swami he thought that it is true the freedom will come someday then afterwards what if i am not practicing the spiritual thing i won't be able to develop anything at that time i won't be able to help the society also so after his he became a very very good Swami he went to London and then came back again he became the president of a tweet ostrom his health was not giving him any way this is the way that we do not know how the god is working but whatever is my responsibility I have accepted I must perform that but with the faith of God mom honest mara jude Dodger ceramic Sri Krishna is not asking Arjuna to give away and meditate no mom Anoosh mother go on repeating my name go on thinking about me concentrate your mind on me and Dame you touch a fight whatever the responsibility that you have taken up do that or genova a Kshatriya he was in a warrior so obviously the God is asking him to go and fight so that is the teaching of God today we learn that God can be realized God can be realized in this very life itself only thing that we have to understand and accept and accept one hundred percent with realization that he is the dua and I am only just like a machine and how that can be developed by going to the holy people listening to the Holy discourses praying to God practicing these all that Saddam o Krishna told us today so next again we will meet in the next Tuesday thank you for coming let us offer our pranaam to taco and then we will stop need anjana medium on antelope um popped on compa Drita bikram be ye chaahat arum para Misha medium tamarama krishnam she'd asana mama oh shanthi shanthi shanthi hurry he old that's three Ramakrishna eponymous to the devotees friends
