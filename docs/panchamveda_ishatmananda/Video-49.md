[50. Panchama Veda 50: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDULmAstn1Y)

let us begin our discourse on Pancham aveda the gospel of sri ramakrishna and as we always do it has chant the Cathar meter Monta Tabaka Tom rhythm top 2g venom Kobe victim calma sharp ahom shravana mangalam srimad otha Tom booby Goonan te URI dodgin ah today we must thank our near a car analogy as a he sang nicely and we could also seem together he said usually our people are very less so we always listen with the Casas today all of you have come we could sing together this song was composed by Xiaomi we become the hints well power swami see Rama Krishna and in the evening rain every day if we can't they sing this is a great prayer we can say is a wonderful prayer and there in the beginning it says con donna of a bandana and along with that we read the gospel of ceramic ish nuh the one gentleman he is not in the ideology of ceramic ashna ideology but he was telling just I got a book wonderful book and I am reading it and all my questions are answered all my doubts assault this is and what that book he said the gospel of sri ramakrishna this is an American gentleman so this way the Saddam apna is reaching the heart of all and everyone we can see everywhere the last time we were discussing about one person asking question said is it possible for one to see God is a wonderful question is it possibly possible for one to see God he's not telling he is not asking whether i can see God whether anyone can see God anywhere anyone and what is the answer of ceramic ish nuh oh yes you can see God but before that you have to practice these these these these so many things if you go to Shankar Acharya he will say ok you sure you can but the thing is the first place there is no God at all is admin and to realize othman to understand darkman you have to practice all the shutter sympathy sama dama opera TTT casa da samad on and then what is shamma what is gamma what is uber OT what this technique sure all that you have to understand you have to practice that under the guidance of your guru they in your mind and body will be purified then there is a chance to understand God and what's Adama Krishna's answer sir is it possible for one to see God yes surely and he can be seen and then afterwards when the person is asking again what is the means by which one can see God can you can you weep for God can you cry for God and with an intense longing if you can cry for him weep for him you can realize God the easiest way i do not know Sanskrit I am NOT a Hindu i have not bathing Ganges nothing at all only one thing is necessary first longing to see God and then second along with the longing the love the tears rolled down thats all these two things and this is the wonderful way see ramakrishna giving the answer and then he is telling the Brahmo Samaj devotee is going on asking different questions then see ramakrishna is staring but who weeps for God so long as the child remains engrossed with its toys the mothers looks after her cooking and other household duties but when the child no longer releases the toys it throw them aside and he yells for its mother and then the mother comes so like that like a child if we can cry for God God will come then the Brahma devotee asking said why are there are so many different opinions about the nature of God again those who speak of God with sorry some say that God has formed while others say that he is formless why all this controversy now again see Ramakrishna's answer when a person he knows everything his answer is simple and when you do not know naturally your answer will be complicated because so many words and so many different things that you will be going on telling one of our Swamiji joking leaves to say i do not know where is now is to say if you cannot convince confused make them confused that jokingly is to say then he will be going on coating so many scriptures and these and that confusing it's not clear why see Ramakrishna is so appealing for everyone because here the surround kitchen we find that he is actually telling everything so simply why and how you could say so simply because he was God Himself he knew how to reach him when the others are telling their telling in so many different ways because they do not know to win a person who was standing I used to give this example in India a person who are standing in in a road of Delhi and suddenly he saw the Prime Minister is coming for some reason the car stopped he lowered down the glass and the person saw him and he saw the prime minister from so close sadly and another person who who is working in the house up on the office of the Prime Minister he also occasionally sees him and the third one who is the private secretary almost continuously sees him and his wife and the children they also seized him meet him now one person goes to first one and say said I came to know that you have seen Prime Minister I want to see him how can I see what he will be his answer go and stand on that road and wait for my chance maybe that someday he will stop he lowered the glass and you cannot because i have seen like that and that is the only way another will say you have to study her you have to appear in the exam then you have to be in the indian administrative service then you can get a chance to become his secretary then you can meet him that is also true and the third one would say if you can become his children son or daughter maybe his relatives best is the wife then you were always with him so all these things are there was true but all different people at Le and they will be telling he knows these he likes these he'll be some of the people who are mixing it me so they will be telling sharmaji likes this from a guy like that that time only not that all the time I like that so when these people have with me they'll be giving suggestions swami ji likes all bitter things who said daga that day it was a bitter food i had to take and with a smiling face I to not that I liked it so this is the hay so you cannot simply gaze the what God God knows only what he likes what he likes he saved tears not the gold the silver and the Swedes and these and there nothing that is only for your satisfaction you are giving but the best thing that the God wants and loves that is the tears can you weep and then when this question he is asking why these so many forms and formless with guna wit without this attributes and we attribute then his answer is God e width attributes and again without attributes near goona goona my just now we were singing sharmaji he is describing see ramakrishna near guna guna muy he is ninguna he is not having any attributes but at the same time he is having all the attributes needed guna guna mine that is the beauty that is the speciality now when Saddam o Krishna speaks is so simple people people think is this religion only to understand religion they go to the scriptures and if you can read Sanskrit that's wonderful and there will be quoting in the Sanskrit and they will say see this is called shastra and so difficult people doubt the simple way see ramakrishna is explaining and at least in the beginning then what happened some of the direct disciples they were also telling do you think see Ramakrishna since I ramakrishna statements and the words really did something some deep meaning as we find it in the Upanishad in the bhagavad-gita in the bhagavata in all the scriptures Shami ji said Shami Vivekananda in every sentence of ceramic ISNA a few days i can describe those lines quoting from different scriptures were in fluid so many days I can continue and he'd really did it now here see ramakrishna is telling the god is wheat attribute and without attribute again so let us see even the Brahmaputra vedanta-sutra it says baqara birth teacher tata he city maha it has a baqara bokaro means the milk becoming yogurt is a big era of the it is the milk but again it is becoming the yogurt it cannot go back to the milk condition the gods bokaro god is creating this universe and creating means he is becoming universe himself but that doesn't mean that he has become the universe no it says when he creates he is with the attribute what is the attribute attribute means his power what is that power Maya in a chamois hey Shankar Acharya in his Russia he says Maya how God is creating through his Maya this Maha Shakti what he how it works first is covered and then throw something else sometimes when we reading the Vedanta we will discuss about that first it will cover when you see something we do not see the real thing in it and then something else it is throwing over that and that is the reason whatever we see in this world is nothing but our mental projection whatever we see we find that in that and then it will be different so this is bokaro Bertie chatot I city Maha in Vedanta shooter it says like that in the bhagavata again bhagavata is the biography the life of sri krishna in the bhagavata it says greetin grita my uru guna cerca de Bahuguna sat aha grita my oh if we break greetin I oh lagoona sargodha guna suta suta ha mean in reality spontaneously in reality he the god is all gonna there is no attributes the moment there is an attribute there is an opposition somebody is good he is bad also the moment he is good there will be something bad when he's bad something good must be there it cannot be only one so that is called the moment God is getting some who knows some quality some attributes is having the opposite also that cannot be so that is the reason when we see that God is creating that is some do not he is manifesting one person is working and when he is working in the field naturally dark dust all those things that they're his clothings are also not that way good he is working and then when after bathing after shower he is sitting for meditation a totally different when he is working in the field he is concerned about the all that thing that is trying to grow over the air but when he is sitting in the meditation is totally forgetting about that work so these two aspect if we can understand of God Godwin creating reserving destroying the active form of God we attribute with all those things are there but when he is not with the wheat attribute he's nearly do not so in the bhagavata it says pancetta she is a famous book in the Vedanta and pancetta sheet says father Shiva Schwab odhani their fathers this embrapa ha bother sure wish of adani only one-fourth of it maybe just giving an idea a very little portion of God that is everything that we see in these universe father assured father means the fit only what we see here is nothing but small portion of his huge body the old body only the feet that we see is the whole universe and then think of the whole thing sometimes they say it is the tip of the iceberg and the huge iceberg is there but we cannot see because it is inside the water only the tip is on the top so like that what we see in this universe with all these multifarious things is nothing but maybe one for a very little portion of God and three brothers the same brava ha that means what all these quotations that I am giving coating from the scriptures one from the bhagavata one from the Barranco sutra one from the pancetta she see ramakrishna stealing god is wheat attribute without attribute and he's his words we get the support from for his words from the scriptures where he says everyone is telling God he is having attribute and without a tribute to and sometimes when you see these universe it's nothing but the quality of God and when we look at the God Himself no attributes and he's pervading all the creation we know that story the God came to a person who was a very good donor he was a very good man donor whoever used to come and ask immediately that used to give and only one kulti within was used to boast a lot i am the donor i only can donate anyone comes to me i can give whatever you ask because i am having everything it was a very very powerful King used to donate people is to come and whatever they asked his to give then there came a small little person bommana he was the God himself and he came he was also in the queue and when he came to the king the King asked what do you want he said only three steps of land King loved what you were asking you were a small person and your feet are so small what he will then he was insisting no I only want only three steps you know the story all of you when the King said well if you want that dick that King was thinking only one small portion of land he can't jump or walk then suddenly he became all-pervading God the small bommana avatar oh he became huge with one feat he covered the heaven and the netherworld with another feet this whole world and with the third feet he was asking the king you have promised to give me the all the three steps land that I want now with my to everything is covered where I will keep the third one that king though was a egoistic person he had devotion he mediately understood and he nailed down before God and say the only place is left is my head please keep your feet on my head so that that is the thing he did and then afterwards there are so many stories are there what actually through the stories they are going to tell us the God we attribute and God without attribute God is having these qualities and God is beyond all the qualities and we know that subhumans Alberto with dois etre teesta the Shang ghulam he is covering everything but at the same time only like a finger he is leaving in the bhagavad-gita team chapter the last sloka he is going on telling about his own qualities all these things that you see is nothing but me and ultimately when Arjuna was almost confused because everything that you see is nothing but me me me he was telling God and then ultimately he said Ottawa or otherwise boohoo 19 Kim giati na dhanam Jaya Oh dananjaya or Juna or Junius another name was dananjaya because he collected lot of farms the today we will be discussing about fun collection let us see who can be done enjoy so this dananjaya this one he collected lot of wealth so tannin Jaya Jaya means who can conquer the gonna all the world sir Oh dananjaya why you are trying to understand so many things only just this will be sufficient for you wish to bum a homonym krishnam econ she nasty to yogurt the jogger is not the only world universe the whole universe is steam account china you know small one portion of mine is the whole universe wasting do you think you'll be able to understand me totally so that is why vagabond see Rama Krishna is telling you cannot Stan God in that way it is better he is transcendent he is unchanged at the Sun same time he is also like these as we see why didn't you put your mind in that and try to understand this then he was telling a story to make it easy for the person to understand listen to a story once a man entered he would and saw a small animal on it tree he came back and told another person that she had seen a creature of a beautiful red color on a certain tree the second man replied when I went into the wood I also saw the same animal but why do you call it rate it was green and then another person another person all we're all of them have seen all of them are telling truth but all different color then on being arc still applied yes one person was there he said why you were calling I know the real answer then what is the real answer he said that person I leave under this tree and I know the animal very well all your descriptions are true sometimes it appears red sometimes Yolo and at other times blue violet great and so forth and that is the way whoever looks at God in his own way he sees God in that way and that is the reason it is so difficult to understand Hinduism even the Hindus do not understand what is Indonesia and they always thing whatever they have understood they have grown up grown up in that atmosphere that is the total Hinduism and nothing else that is also the problem it is so vast is very very difficult to even to why it is so many seen the Semitic religion when you see that we find that it is nothing but one God and one goal one holy book and one philosophy so this is the only one the symmetric religion Indian religion this says that one God with many hue and shapes so naturally this is difficult the one young man he has written to me the sharmaji I am reading about data I like to treat the vaquita and I am having nearly seven or eight different versions of Avadh gate and I am confused because almost everyone telling different things so how what to take which one to accept it is really very difficult if you read the huggabug beta published by the bush nabha is totally different if you read the bhagavad-gita published by the do a theme basista three-team a do a thing all are different why because they are explaining explaining it in their own way but everything is true if it applies to you if it applies to you suppose you are reading all these then you peel that this is the explanation that I like I understand I think this is true that is true for you and then slowly when you grow we develop then you will understand something better way then you will understand all paths are leading to the same goal and that is why ceramic ISNA he is telling if you are Paul following some particular path no problem but do not criticize others here see Rama Krishna is explaining again if a jug of water is enough to remove my thirst why should I measure the quantity of water in a lake so this is the beauty we go on studying and spending our time in the library and consulting so many things then we write down and then we say everything is confusing everything issue there's a wastage of time it is your you are not understanding properly one glass of water is sufficient for you and why why you are going to measure the whole water in the lake the god has different ideas things we do not understand some people they will come and ask if God is so kind then why his trial is killing the those people in Palestine and if the Israelis coming you will be telling why God is not happy with us we should kill or remove all the Palestinians now the Palestinians people are telling why God is cruel and cling aza why because it is our own interest we seem that way the British use when they were ruling Indians they used to tell the Patriots that you are dacoits and the Indians used to say no they're Patriots is the same person when he is working fighting on our behalf he is a patriot when he is fighting against us is an enemy we stealing this it's me so obviously all these things that we see in the gods were so many things is going on do we know why these people are suffering we do not know at the there may be so many other things are there when you go to the jail when you see those people I went to a Bombay jail they asked me to speak that is that the time he went and they are not ordinary Thebes they're all underground people that all the same things and they kill people all these things but when you look at these people they're so simple so gentle they were all sitting like this one young boy maybe hardly 21 22 very good-looking fair complex big eyes and he was almost peeping from behind of another person just to be the shyness and Jay as the the young people they do but he has killed four or five people and when I was asking why this boy is in the jail then the superintendent was sitting by my side and he looks good but he behaves bad because he has already killed killed five people can you imagine tortured so many so that is why when we go and see something and we say why these people should be tortured they should be in the jail and they are punished we do not know the background when you know the background we can understand in this world so many things are going on we do not know the background suddenly someone who was just by my side my friend we were together suddenly he become very famous and he's getting everything I become jealous i say no this is wrong this is bad i do not know how he had he was working so hard he was working day and night and he has earned his made it by that way I didn't do anything so obviously these are the difficulty sometimes our teacher says to tell careful about the first boy because he is all he's so intelligent he'll be reading little and sometimes in the dead night and all the time inspiring us to go and play in the girl at the ground and and we we have if we can read at least 3-4 hours we can understand a little and if he reads only 10 minutes or half an hour sufficient for him because of his understanding capacity intelligent so when I am thinking oh he's a fast boy if he can play I can also go along with him I should follow a fast boy and then I was at least the last boy now I am plucked so what happens that's why when we are trying to follow these people they wear with us why suddenly they are there because they had the capacity something was there so this is the reason when we are trying to get the answer of all the problems that we see in the human society we are confused no one can get the answer how to solve the problem there are parliament of religions there only thing is to bring all people together discussing about the peas peas and peace harmony and peace even there will be so many other groups of people there only objective is to discuss and spread the message of harmony and peace but to whom he is spreading that this those people are spreading those who are already in harmony and peace but those who never care about the harmony and peace we cannot reach them so that is the problem when you are as I was I told you that the tribal people who never welcomed anyone that is welcomed the word is absent why any new one came the killed him no question of welcoming it was very simple the similarly these people they are having there because by that they're having their money their livelihood their position everything that they enjoy in this world by doing that simply I go and then pray oh then we some white besoms we're for giving them in the sky after oh you go and that is the P symbol of peace will that help them nothing so we have to understand so there are so many things in this way God when he is working in his administration he knows what to do what not to do with whom that is why I ramakrishna is telling yours is the path of tea and it is easy yours is the path of tea and that is very good it is an easy part why because two things are there in the book team first I have someone in my front with whom I can talk I can share my views may be that he is not answering i am going on praying to God there is no everything was saying in the morning as he was after the prayer also same thing no problem for him but if I think that he is listening to me even it is not listening at least I am giving out whatever they're in my mind and I am free that is also help but one thing is sure all the great spiritual personalities spiritual personalities are telling there is God believe it and with the conviction they are telling again and again conviction they are telling those who are pure in heart they will see God Jesus saying and how the purity will come by love and how we can develop love see Ramakrishna say can you weep can you cry for God so simple this way we can really get our mind purified and we can see God if we cannot gain we can blame Lord Buddha when someone was asking you were having everything now leaving those things you were going for something whom you have not seen you are not sure about his existence why he said I am sure about his existence but the same I'm sure about this existence but if i do not realize that truth that knowledge i will think there was something lacking in me that is why i could not realize that truth but truth is their God is there it's not that I could not reach God realize God and I go until you know I tried nothing is there some of the people they go and join in the Rumaki and the sum of the organization spiritual organization they will be there for two years then they will change to another then they will change to another afterwards they come back and write a huge volume of books maybe two three volumes I was there and I have experienced and i can tell you nothing is there as God his experience of two years in the spiritual life he says like that so like this there are people we are reading their books and wasting our time arguing only that is why I ramakrishna's telling if a jug of water is sufficient for you why you are going to measure the quantity of water in the lake then he is telling the bathers speak of seven planes you are thinking about only your mind you know where what is your mind where it is then he is still in Veda means knowledge and it's speaks of the seven planes where the mind dwell and then he goes on telling the fast three level mooladhara swadisthana and Manny Parra these are the three levels Manny Parra is the novel level these three majority of the people's mind dwell in that that's why constantly they are thinking about the worldly thoughts and they do not know they think they're great thinkers they're going on writing some books and that is becoming best sailor what is their nasty stories and they'll be writing in such a way people will be reading that who is writing he knows who is reading he also knows but the same thing in a beautiful way when it is their whole night will be reading that book and they are so happy bestseller what is their up to that never level and we are talking about the God we are talking about the spirituality we are talking about the Creator and who am I talking about it whose mind is only in the three plane then see Rama Krishna is telling when it comes on the fourth plane that is Anahata the heart when the mind dwells there one has the fast gleams of spiritual consciousness when the mind reaches to the heart then only one can have the glimpse is not the full site dreams only a flash only of spiritual consciousness some people come in and so many people they come and meet me sitting over here I see so many varieties they're so nice they came and said we are all spiritual people and I to K ok I stood em over Poonam oh please sit down and they are very happy that I offered pronoun and they sat down and then I talk there is a full one sometimes the devotees that being the candies I always give their candy as a thank you come again and spiritual people it is so easy they do not understand what is spirituality so that's why they think that only they are chanting some names or reciting some poems or doing early mornings ax that is nothing there is only going to the primary school that is the first thing two young girls came the elder one I asked her in which standard in which grade you are studying she the mother told her immediately she corrected no i am going to be on the fourth at willya now the exam is over she is sure that she'll be in the four so she told the other one I told in which grade you study then she said i am going to be in the primary so she is not starting it now but she'll be admitted and the primary she is going to be admitted but she so that way we think that we are spiritual why we have recited some of the slokas nothing religion is realization that is what swami vivekananda say and sri ramakrishna stealing only on the fourth stage Anahata when the heart when your mind comes then the dreams of consciousness in the fifth plane that is the throat the mind reaches there becomes full of so many other things he will be telling about God etc now the time is up next class will be discussing about these seven plane the ceramic Krishna in a very simple way he is telling as his owned in a village fashion simple way all the time supporting his words with some enacted some stories but they are very very profound and very deep to understand so that's why we have to understand this and utter agita it says about the Samadhi just I am quoting from that aakasam mana Sumitra mana grita Nyriss padam nice chillum tum bhi Johnny arc Samadhi structure luck shanem we will explain it in the next class so this is the beautiful the words that we find in the Gospel of cinema krishna and that is why we say respond chama vida the fifth vida the lettuce cover of a pranaam to see ramakrishna and conclude needin genomic IAM onon kerubim popped on compa Drita big tomboy yavitt
