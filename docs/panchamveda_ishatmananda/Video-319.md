[320. Panchama Veda (320) - “Devotion”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMivecXMmdM)

namaskar this evening we'll be studying the panchama veda the gospel of krishna let us begin as usual with this last time when we were discussing this gospel when we were reading from the page 706 we are continuing from there itself the question was the girish is asking to bhagavan si ramakrishna said what is ekangi we discussed that in the in our last wednesday the islam krishna gave an unique example he said it is one-sided love like water doesn't like the duck the duck likes the water the duck will go and jump in the water and play in the water water is not inviting the duck it's like the a congee one-sided love you don't love me but i like you so i go to you i enjoy your company i like to serve you this is a beautiful love without any expectation a congee when that young narendra is to come to bhagavan's ramakrishna sirama krishna naturally the god himself he could understand who that young boy was apparently he was an ordinary like any other young person but he was not he was the shiva himself krishna is to respect him love him give lot of attention and people other around used to think why he is giving so much attention to this particular boy and then one day siram krishna suddenly stopped talking with narendra nath the young vivekananda and not only one day or two days it continued for almost a long period of time and whenever this young boy came his ramakrishna will turn his face he won't talk to him his the physical that the posture that was very clear that i am not liking you but even then he will be coming you'll be sitting listening and sometimes lying down on the floor like that one day it's ramakrishna i am not talking with you not paying attention at all then why do you come this narendra he said how long how much you will be the age at least 17 18 years he said sir i like you i love you i respect you so i come to you this is called ekangi prema that particular see ram krishna used to love him guided him but that particular moment sadam krishna wanted to see whether this boy is coming to me because i am paying attention to him so that was the main most of our devotees also they will be coming to the astra if they get the proper attention and these and that the moment they won't they will stop coming so much of ego they'll never look they will never talk they think it is not necessary but it is up to them but the why do you come only for that monk only for that person are they in charge over there no you come for the god if we forget that why we are coming to the temple then it is of no use visiting the holy place so this is a kangi then sudama krishna mentioned that this is sadharani and samanjasa and samartha sadharani is a very selfish type of love i want everything from you whether you like it or not i want everything from you and whether you like it or not sadharani satan means very ordinary sadharan ordinary and it's a selfish type of love give me these give me that i serve me all this but i don't care about you so that is a sadharani and second is samanjasah samanja sa both side i'm also giving you the love and you also reciprocating there's usually that is called samanjasa normal the i am giving attention to god i am praying to god god is also fulfilling my prayer answering my prayer i am very happy samantha but the very perfect and the highest as ramakrishna is mentioning is the samartha samartha means this is the top most samartha means capable i have that samarthus is a sanskrit word what is that capability even if i am not getting attention from you i am not expecting anything from you i give all loving you that is the radha bhagavan srama krishna is mentioning it is only for the radha she was happy in krsna's happiness that's called samartha that this different type of one is a congee another is ekangi and samartha almost like the same but the samartha is the highest here the love i am not expecting anything but i am concerned that you must be happy so that is why the mentioning like this then he said the gopis love those who are associated with the indian culture they'll know the gopi means those holy ladies who were in brindavan they used to love lord krishna so about them krishna is mentioning their love was just like that krishna should be happy god should be happy whether god is listening to my prayer or answering my prayer or not it doesn't matter so then one asks like this a devotee is asking sir who may be called an antaranga but before we go to this answering this question as we the last week we discussed that we should continue a little about this devotion what is this devotion there are many schools of devotion they also come under the umbrella vedanta one of the schools and that is propounded by shankaracharya and they are purely monistic they don't believe in any other thing but only the self etc they don't think that there is two separate entities like the jiva and the god no it is the same thing only you are thinking in a different way that much otherwise it is the same thing so there are but here today we will discuss about other the bhakti that is called ramanujas he was also a vedantin but bidantin he developed another school and that is called vishishta advaitha precision is a very specific very important what is that besieged because here it says this explanation difference in explanation why the different schools same thing they are telling only explanations are different different scholars different teachers they explain thing in their way those who are following them they follow that particular school the ramanuja for him what is that bhakti is the dhyana and upasana ramanuja said what is bhakti dhyana meditation and upasana prayer now the natural the question the whom i am meditating on whom i am meditating it says it is the visnu lord visnu the ramanuja he is telling lord vishnu we have to remember this at different schools different teachers they are mentioning the object of love in a different way so this is ramanuja says vishishta dwaita is the dhyana on whom we will meditate he said visnu and then upasana upasana means literally the one who goes near to that god upa upo means near asana i sit near near to whom to god upo asana upasana i am sitting near god but here dupasana means prayer i am praying to god i am worshipping god i am devoted to god i am offering everything to god and who is that god vishnu that is ramanuja and three stages of bhaktis are there in the ramanuja said three stages of bhakti what is that one is sad the three different type of stage there of course when i'm beginning the my journey in this school the obviously it is all very ordinary type of education so that it goes in this way one of our the great teacher uh the swami he was explaining that the vedantic way of counting we always forget ourselves so there is an example the dasamastamasi that you are the tenth one that's very famous many of you have heard that so he was counting in in his lecture he was mentioning one two three he was going up to nine that was the young boy so he has only started going to school he was listening and after listening two three times that he is counting up to nine what is the tenth one he was then he said i can count up to 20. so he was very confident though this gentleman cannot count after 10 but i can count up to 20. so that is called there is also knowledge that's also he's also going to school he's also sitting in the classroom he has his books he has his teacher but still that knowledge that way is a sadhana so that is the beginning of the bhakti and second he's the higher where we feel that i am so close to god and as if i can see god i can feel the presence of god the higher highest becoming one with god constant so this is the ramanuja another teacher very famous teacher is called nimbark is duality but at the same time non-duality advaita to him to nimbarkar bhakti means service of god through body speech and mind the ramanujas was dhyana and upasana nimbark says you have to serve god how physically you have to go and serve the lord physically by you know working for the asama working for the temple and through the speech when you are talking you must quote always and speak about the god and also mind you are going on thinking the physically the mentally and bachelor in sanskrit they say we work three ways with the means physically through words manaseka through thoughts through mind so when i am talking i'm talking about god and when i'm working working for god and at the same time i'm going on meditating thinking pondering of god so that is nimbarkas and it says the two stages of devotion ramanuja three stage first primary higher highest and supreme parama but here it says primary stage final stage no middle stage so that is the two difference only the this is the way nimbarka is called then come madua charia so we mainly the we know about the shankara ramanuja and madhua nimbark and others and that we now it is not very popular but that those schools are there madhua pure daitva is completely different means god is separate i am separate and here dweeta advaita we are one with god but at the same time in the beginning we are different then slowly we develop love and then slowly we go and very close to god merge with god if the god wishes we can merge with god we can be near to god all these things so ramanuja nimbarka and madwa bhakti means devotion to narayana ramanuja said devotion to the visnu and he said narayana another form of the same vishnu narayana then comes the ballaba shuddhad they are all acharya acharya means the teachers they are all philosophers so one after another in all bhakti schools under the banner of the bhakti under the umbrella of the bhakti the devotion all the schools are there so ramanuja nimbarka madhwa and balaba he said to him bhakti means devotion to child krishna the just for our remembrance ramanuja is the vishnu nimbarka is a service to god and the god may say bishni again and madhuaa it says it is narayana and then comes the ballaba sudhada is a child krishna and three stages of devotion one is physical another financial another manaser the difference is kaig bachik manasika of the nimbarka but bhallavah says no is a physically and bitter your wealth your money that should be utilized for the service of god and manasseh you must go on pondering over god meditating on god praying to god mentally so three that way we can practice the bull lovers he has the bhakti means devotion to child krishna baby krishna this is balabas this is called his philosophy is name as sudha dwitha then comes the chaitanya sri caitanya nearly 400 450 ah years before bhagavad-gita in the same bengal with india he had the chaitanya mahaprabhu but he's the chait famous as caitanya mahaprabhu is the highest god something highest teacher see chaitanya his bhakti means devotion to radha krishna there are so many vaishnavas are there not that all the vaisnavas are worshiping radha krishna when we see that a group of vaishnavas are worshiping radha krishna that belongs to chaitanya school so when the ramanuja they are also vaishnavas but they worship vishnu when the nimbarka same visnu but in a different way then madhua it is narayana then ballaba it is child krishna a sri chaitanya same visnu in the radha krishna form all this kirtan that we hear and the dances that we see these are all gorier samaj see the devotion we were talking about sudama krishna was talking about the devotion so many schools are there but all are leading to the same goal that is god they may give the name of god in a different way sometime vishnu or child baby krishna child krishna or the radha krishna or the narayana whatever it may be so we are all same and there is no conflict you love that form it is okay so this is the beauty so caitanya veda that thing that we cannot think that means that goes beyond our all senses and veda aveda there is a difference at the same time there is no difference so achieve the veda away the bother it has seven stages the devotion slowly slowly it increases ramanuja three ordinary then higher than the supreme like this but it has seven and in the seven stages his first is rati prema sneha mana raga unuraga mahabhaba that is the highest form mahabhava only radha had that the experiencing that mahabhava i am that krishna that was only for radha that's why the radha concept is there for the gaudiya vaisnava samaj they are mainly from the gold banga the bengal said the gory of vishnu samaj they have the concept of the radha who is this rather pure sattva that's why radha is purely white and har she is so soft that's why lady form and she is merging with that because of the sattva there is no ego that is the reason it's called unu raga and finally mahabhava those who are interested you can read in details about it and the seven stages slowly it goes up in the bhagavata we find that sri krishna say to uddhava now the thing is how the devotion will develop the devotional schools different schools are there different types of devotions are there but how we will generate the devotion that is a beautiful question very wonderful question and here the lord krishna he is giving the answer to the uddhava in the uddhava gita in the bhagavata it says now here it says bhakti yoga in a satsang bina means without without what satsanga what is satsanga holy company without the holy company you cannot generate bhakti devotion now bhakti yoga means that devotion which is a power which is a force which we are utilizing to realize god using to reach god that is possible only after the holy company so holy company can help you and then he said this is the only easiest path and then i don't know whether there is any other paths are not that is lord krishna is mentioning i don't know any other paths easiest like this what is the the thing you have to have the holy company bhagavan sirama krishna also mentioned the holy company's nehesiri sadhu-sanga in the whole the hindu tradition they always speak about the sadhu sangha this is very very essential what is the sangha sangha means company if you have that good company then only your thought will be directed towards that it's only mind it is only the thought if someone is going on telling you about something you know that in different countries different they will be going on telling about this oh this is our country this is our motherland we should give our life for this land and we should fight for it they go on talking about that suppose that particular person is in some other country he'll be talking about that country so it goes on this way this is very very temporary but it is also necessary for the the society but for the spiritual life no spiritual life has no that narrowness it goes beyond all the socio political economical everything beyond this goes to love majority of the people don't understand why because selfishness they only think about themselves me my family my society my religion my country it is going on little increasing but as a limit they can't think of anything else and when you are going to embrace the whole world they think oh this is a fool why should you do that whatever the best thing you must collect that's selfishness that's why you need a holy company and the holy company slowly when you were listening when you were reading the gospel of sudama krishna the highest holy company those who regularly read the gospel of sirama krishna holy company and there bhagavan sirama krishna so categorically very clearly slowly slowly taking our mind to a bigger and bigger and bigger place this is your god good you like this god okay continue but don't hate others also who is worshipping the same god one is worshipping lord vishnu shankarchakra padma dhari another is worshipping narayana another worshipping the child krishna another worshipping krishna with radha young krishna with the playmate radha so like this different same god in different form in different name in different situation different teachers are worshipping them and asking them to worship that whatever you like you can continue why to hate others why to criticize others first you sincerely go and graduated from that university realize the god through that path fast then you see what you have got after the realization of that lord it will be only love and nothing else and that is after practicing all these paths he said all paths are leading to the same goal and this truth was pronounced long long back at the time of the veda in the satya yoga truth is one sages call it by various names to understand this we need a really clear mind a narrow subjugated contaminated mind can never think of it so this is the way we have to understand that's why sadhu sangha is necessary in the bhagavata again it is emphasizing on the holy company it says i am not quoting the whole verse it says it is true that the sages said association is the cause of bondage association of worldly association world association means it is all selfishness and my country my culture my religion my language the my property my family oh this is my my my i'm all come only i me and mind only i comes this all associated with the ego but what is that ego before your birth where you were what was there the ego and after your death where the ego will go but foolishly only maybe we are surviving for 60 years 70 years going on jumping ego ego ego so that he's telling if you are having the company of those type of people your mind your thought will be directed to that that is bad why bad because again you have to take birth if you cannot overcome the ego you cannot love you cannot become unselfish again you have to come back and you have to take birth and you do not know where whom you were hating today maybe you have to take birth among them someday and suffer like them we do not know whether you like it or not accept it or not believe it or not that is the truth the karma vandana no one can go beyond it so it says association is very bad because it causes bondage the sages said but the lord krishna bhagavan krishna is mentioning but this soybean sadhushu but if that association is with the monk with the holy people sadhu sadhumi is not always hmong sadhum is the good people holy people krito makshadaram abritam 25th chapter 20th verse second line i'm quoting apa britain but if you have the association of the holy people then that association will help you to reach to the liberation association is bad said the sages but that association meant the worldly association but association of the holy people will help you to realize the god makshadaram upabritam it is wide open if you have the proper good association of the holy people now the question is who are the holy people again in the bhagavata the same bhagavata it mentions the forgiveness those who are having the forgiveness it's so difficult to forgive till death they'll be remembering no no i have to take the revenge revenge revenge they can't forgive it needs a broad mind to forgive so titik shabba then karuni kaaha kind-hearted if the mind is not kind at it it cannot be a holy person it's impossible if a person cannot forgive if somebody has done something wrong to you and you are going on pondering over that remembering over that and planning to take the revenge you may be anyone but you are not a holy person holy person will never do that and karuni kaha kind-hearted it can't harm anyone it cannot see the suffering of others a kind-hearted suhrida sarvadehinam is a friend of all oh he is from my family so i am i must serve them and he is from my same village and there is a word is from my same group and we should help them they can never become a holy person never ever so that is why surhida sarva de hinam it is in the bhagavata lord krishna is mentioning those who are worshiping the lord krishna if we don't do it that means we are not following the words of our god sarva-de-hinam he's not mentioning these these these this anyone who ever comes i am the friend of that person then ajata satraba having no enemy because in his mind there is no hatred who is a sadhu who is a holy person not a gerua clad person not one who is having no clothes or lot of the matted here no not like that all those external the real monk a real sadhu real holy person must have these qualities that this is titik shabab he can forgive karuni kaha full of kind hearted surita friend of everyone so either sarva-bhutanam or jaata satriba having no enemy because there is no hatred other may think about him but he doesn't think anything wrong about others because there is no desire please uh appreciate me please follow me no desire so shantha he is very peaceful sadva and simple never tell anything in a crooked way in it in such a way that people won't understand to deceive people something never ever because he doesn't have any agenda to get the benefit get the prophet nothing very simple the saddha then sadhu sana they are the highest holy people now friends we were discussing about the devotional path bhagavan's ramakrishna has because they were asked one question which is the economy bhakti then he mentioned different stages of bhakti different types of bhakti according to the different temperament of the people then we find from our scripture that under the umbrella of the vedanta there are so many that duality so many devoted school of devotions are there and then finally from the bhagavata we find that it is only through from the holy company one can generate one can achieve one can have devotion and who is the holy person this quality should be there and also the lord is mentioning in the same bhagavata one who has renounced his heart and home one who is still living in the samsara having the family can never become a holy person because he's having the selfishness that is very clear that's why swami vivekananda said about the religion one must get the advice from a monk who has left each and everything hearth and home he is not having anyone of his own so naturally they are completely free so that person is a then as because he is not having anything of his own he and he is not having any craving for the worldly things like the wealth the power social recognition nothing at all if a holy person is working for the society and keeping all the record and then submitting to the that the country government to get the recognition of that country no he is not holy person as an organization they sometimes do but an individual no at all so then what another thing these are all no no no what is yes love for god whatever he does does for god he is a holy person now this is the way we understand and now we go back to the pages of the gospel of sirama krishna i'm reading from this as uh 766 the one gentleman is asking a devotee a devotee means master marsha himself sometimes the he was keeping hiding himself so mentioned as a devotee like that it's a devotee sir who may be called an antaranga now antaranga very close to the god very close to the divine the holy person those who understand this little bit sanskrit the pronunciation is anta anta means inside but he is outside anger means the body and bohe anger the external body and internal very close so he is asking who are the antaranga then the master is ramakrishna is giving the illustration let me give an illustration in the not mandir you know the hindu temples the traditional hindu temples are having two different parts it must be there is one called garbha mandira sanctum sanctorum and another is not a mandida this is a general part where all people they assemble they sing bhajan then be dancing there will be presentation debate all these things will be there not from there not mandira and god will be watching in front of the god that is the not mandir so suramar krishna mentioning about the not mandira has pillars the inside and outside he was mentioning about the dakshinesha that if you go to dakshinesha if you have seen the picture of dakshinesha temple a completely separate temple then a little open space then a hall that is called not mandir it has two different types of peelers one the external peeler holding that roof and the internal peelers that's also supporting the roof but external and internal giving that sudama krishna is mentioning the god is in the center those who are very pure-hearted they are very close to god and those who are not so much they're little outside so antaranga bahiranga in atmandir has peelers inside and outside and antaranga is like the inside pillars those who always leave near the guru are the antarangias the guru means the holy person guru means the god to muhimacharan bhagavan siddharama krishna now addressing the mahima and he's telling the ghani wants neither a form of god nor his incarnation that's very clear idea and that is sirama krishna apparently he is an ignorant person he never attended school he never started any scripture but look at it this knowledge from within so the veda is known as apora aporoshare it's not intellectual somebody imagined they thought and then he wrote down not like that it comes from within from the realization though bhagavan sidha krishna never read any scriptures but all the truths of the scriptures all the truth of the scripture i am mentioning all the truth truth is only one but the different way as they have mentioned in different scripture different way of expression of the same truth everything was known to him he is mentioning here the gyani wants neither a form of god nor his incarnation or who is the part of ghani most of us we know gyana means knowledge and what is that knowledge who am i searching that now i am that one they believe that there is no two it is only one and if it is one then who is meditating on whom the moment i think i am meditating so i is there when the notion of i is there and tao or you oh god so that is also there but the path of knowledge they cannot meditate this is the way if you read some of the other scriptures then one rishi the he was going on thinking so i am not this body i am not this mind i am not this guy i i don't have any connection with anything of this manifested world he was going on thinking again again again again so that deep sense then who am i that comes the consciousness so that is their path they are not meditating they are not worshiping that's why bhagavan's rama krishna he is mentioning ghani wants because mohimacharan had the tendency to follow the path of knowledge not knowing actually perhaps not very clearly the what that path is how to follow that path and what is the goal how to achieve it so sudama krishna clarifying him very clearly the ghani wants neither a form of god we were reading that ramanujas for form of god is vishnu caitanya's form is radha krishna like this like this began he will never ask for any form nor his incarnation while wandering in the forest ramachandra saw a number of rishis and they welcomed him to their asama with great love and said to him in the ramayana when we are reading ramayana once in a month we are giving the class on ramayana also now we have reached to that see ramachandra entering into that forest and so many rishis he was meeting one after another though we thought that is a forest but wonderful people is to live over there the best minds just to live in the forest and see ramachandra went over there and he told his wife that i am going to spend some time with these great minds they're unselfish people they love all this and they are researching to find out the truth it's a beautiful environment there is no selfishness so i like to go to the end he met those rishis bhagavan sirama krishna mentioning they may they met all these great rishis the seers rishi or the muni though they used to ponder is to think is to meditate researchers we can say spiritual researchers they met sri rama and said o rama today our life is blessed because we have seen you and this y is capital that means you is god those rishis through their yogic power they could realize that is the supreme brahman para brahma he has come in the form of sri rama chandra but the ramachandra never wanted that that should be disclosed because ordinary people general mosque they were not ready to accept that there will be commotion misunderstanding and that is the reason in the ramayana we never find that he is claiming like that or instructing for spiritual life no immediately after the satya is coming and he is establishing the society the purushotama that's why the ramachandra when the rishis they realized issues they understood they came to see that oh you are the son of dasharata they understood that who is he but again they never wanted to disclose it they said you are the son of dasharata and bharadwaj and other sages call you a divine incarnation but that is not our view we meditate on the in indivisible saccidananda rama was pleased with them and smiled one these they said rama we know the bharadwaja said that you are that supreme but at this moment we are not accepting because we meditate on satchi ananda sarupa niruguna nira kara the one who is not having any epithets when one who is not having any form we is all pervading consciousness we meditate on that supreme brahman o rama we are not accepting you as an incarnation of god to the bharadwaja the great sage said rama was pleased because he never wanted that that should be disclosed ah what state of mind i pass through now suramar krishna he is mentioning about his own spiritual condition that he was passing my mind would lose itself in the indivisible absolute the cerama krishna is the embodiment of all paths is advaita vishishta dwaita advaita all that we read everything he practiced now he's mentioning about the absolute advaita mahima charan he was talking with sirama krishna now sirama krishna giving a hint to mahimajuran and other devotee that though he's in the human form sitting before them talking to them but he is that absolute brahmana that's why he mentioned about the sri dhamma the rama smiled hearing those rishis those who said we don't at this moment we are not accepting you as sachirananda we are accepting you the son of the sharatha the king rama never said oh no you don't understand that i am a neighbor here also sri ramakrishna he is giving the hint that he is also that absolute para brahma but in the form of sirama krishna apparently so ordinary looking is sitting before them talking with them living with them so he but he is mentioning those who will understand they will understand what a state of mind i pass through my mind would lose itself in the indivisible absolute how many days i spent that week i renounced bhakti and bhakta devotion and devotee i became inert i could not feel the form of my own hate i was about to die i thought of keeping ramallah's aunt near me ramallah's aunt means our mother ma saruda because rama krishna used to forget about his existence when we are practicing the gyana marga there is no duality then the mind forget that it has a body the mind goes and merges with the absolute like a drop of water that falls in the ocean how can that drop of water can retain his individuality in the ocean water it happens like that i ordered to remove the removal of all the pictures and portraits from my room when i regained outer consciousness when the mind climbed down to the ordinary level i felt as if i were being suffocated like a drowning person at last i said to myself if i cannot be a people then how shall i leave then my mind was again directed to bhakti and bhakta what has happened to me i kept asking people bholanath said to me another person he was he was the the he was a staff of the dakshinesh he mentioned this state of mind has been described in the mahabharata how can a man leave on coming down from the plane of samadhi surely he requires devotion to god and the company of devotees otherwise how will he keep his mind occupied as a pure mind they cannot live in the company of the unpure mind impure minds so impure minds constantly think about the selfishness so this is my money i should do this i should have that so this is the way they think they always talk about the in the lost and gold so the pure mind who has already given up all those things they feel suffocated so obviously if they like to leave they live in the company of the devotees these devotees though they are living in the world but still their mind is purified they love god they like to listen to god listen about god they pray and they all these things that they do so the mind is to some extent very pure so naturally the holy person he loves to be in that company unholy people those who are constantly thinking about the me and mine associated with the body the egoistic people they will never can appreciate the company of a holy person rather they will think oh these people are just like that they talk like this this is not practical and they will go to those holy people so-called holy people who are having social contacts great names why because they will also get the benefit of out of that so they go for their own benefit not for any spiritual development not for any spiritual benefit they go to those people who are famous so that they also can get associated with the higher society to get the benefit so this is usually normally we see in the society so one should be very very careful that's why it is so important to read the gospel of salama krishna because in the gospel of sadama krishna it is very clearly bhagavan si ramakrishna is giving very clear idea who is a holy person and without the company of the holy person without listening to him without hearing him without serving him we won't be able to purify our mind and so long we are in that impurity for that long we have to go on taking rebirth after rebirth which is nothing but suffering that's why the lord buddha said it is all suffering suffering suffering so friends we are reading this then mahima charan he is mentioning about this sir can a man return from the plane of samadhi to the plane of the ordinary world mahima jiren is having the doubt why the surama krishna mentioned see in one paragraph we read suramar krishna is mentioning to mahima charan about his condition where his mind merged with the supreme all-pervading consciousness then again he came back and he was wondering how to survive and bholanath he mentioned that it is in the mahabharata that this step holy people they live in the company of the devotees and devotion now he is again asking vaimacharan this was clear again he is asking can a man return from the plane of samadhi to the plane of the ordinary world he is doubting the statements of bhagavan si ramakrishna the sudama krishna in a low voice i shall tell you privately you are the only one fit to hear it now why because the ramakrishna understood that his mind is not open okay i will give you some time maybe you know the salam krishna had that capacity he could just change the mind by touching or showing something like the mathura babu the mathura babu was doubting the way that this man is a divine person a just ordinary person he's pacing up and down of the baranda and mathura from a distance he was observing and thinking such an ordinary person why people think that is a holy man and is a divine immediately muthurbabu saw that in one way sudama krishna walking he is the sheba and when he is turning back it is a kali the same person as the lord shiva and the kali matul babu was the devotee of shiva and the kali he came running and fell at the feet of sirama krishna and said lord i will never doubt you i will never doubt you same doubt came in the mind of arjuna the lord krishna had to show because they used to love them sudama krishna used to love mathura babu so he showed that shri krishna is to love arjuna he showed that as a vishwaroopa so like that maybe i don't know sirama krishna was thinking or mentioning that i will tell you privately but then he mentioned about the question also asked me the same question i will read these two lines and he will conclude and maybe in the next wednesday we will discuss about it you see there is a vast difference between the jiva and ishwara jiva is the individual self and ishwara the supreme god through worship and austerity a jebu can at the utmost attain samadhi but he cannot come down from that state after attending the samadhi the ordinary mind cannot come down because there is so much joyful why he will come down see my mind forgets about the existence of the body on the other hand an incarnation of god can come down from samadhi because it is his will we will continue this now if there is any question we will try to answer this one please tell us about radha was rather truly present or is rather represented as a whole human body i'll just repeat no no i understood that it is a radha represented yeah that is actually is the radha sometimes some people they say some scholars they say there was no such character as the radha that that was developed by sri chaitanya mahaprabhu that a a character which through different problems because you know that in india the orthodox family she was a married lady but even then she is coming out going to krishna and not careful about the social thing so by that way because of tremendous attention love for the krishna sometimes some people say it is actually only to teach ordinary people what type of love or devotion should be for god so they depicted a character sometimes they say and it is there radha was there that is the that conception but whatever we can say as bhagawans ramakrishna told young boy he said i don't like this type of love conjugal lifetime the ramakrishna immediately said oh you are very young you are not understanding but anyway can't you see the tremendous attraction a love of radha for krishna take that take that whether she is a lady and loving a man sri krishna is not a man shri krishna is the embodiment of the consciousness so obviously we should not think in a different way though the many of the stories books and many people like to depict in that way in the songs in the drama but it is not like the the our ordinary worldly love it is the divine soul going to the supreme soul that way the pure divine soul going to the supreme soul merging that individual pure soul is rather and going and merging with the krishna so that is the way mostly we should take thank you akshay bhati is asking if a jiva cannot come down from samadhi done then does that mean the jiva will no longer live after samadhi yes as bhagavatam krishna again said after 21 days they die the when they truly there is a samadhi is very very difficult very very difficult for the ordinary people those who are really a very high exalted spiritual people they survive for the betterment of others for this for to serve the others that is true thank you okay friends let us chant this mantra and we
