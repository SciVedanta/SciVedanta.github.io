[280. Panchama Veda 280 : Godâ€™s Birthday Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm8hV6eyZ0I)

good evening dear devotees and friends today is wednesday evening and we'll be reading the gospel of sri ramakrishna the panchama veda as usual we will start with this sloka tabukatham ritam tapta jibanam [Music] and today we'll be reading the 36th a chapter aheading the master's birthday the date sunday february 22nd 1885. so this is bhagavan siram krsna's birthday they are going to celebrate but before that as we were reading that master masha is mentioning over here let us complete this page he is telling that kedar a government official the who was in calcutta now he was posted in dhaka dhaka the present day bengal the capital of the bingo in those days in the british time all were in india the bangladesh and the burma all these birds were in india so the from dhaka it's from calcutta he was posted to dhaka he was a devotee so what he did and this is the uniqueness and by this way only the surama krishna movements ramakrishna ideologies spread it that one person wherever he is going he's carrying this ideology and then collecting some other people the similar minded people same many people they'll be coming and they'll be discussing about this in those days there was no book the gospel of salaam krishna was not published there was no biography of bhagavan sirama krishna so obviously that particular devotee from his own memory sometimes reading the bhagavad-gita and whatever he heard from sirama krishna is to share as because he was a big officer so he was having some educated friends some other their relatives and some neighbors they used to come they gather in the in the dhaka and they used to discuss about the spirituality so they that was all right but you know in india it is the system that whenever you are going to listen to some holy talks or visiting some holy people or anyone discussing about the religion they will never go empty-handed they will carry something as a gift for him or her so visiting holy person that way the the although naturally it was not necessary for the people to bring anything for him but even then as per the tradition i am going to listen to some holy discussion so i should carry something so they used to bring fruits and sweets and all those offerings now there's a beautiful conversation that took between the kedar and bhagavan sirama krishna the kedar is asking to master humli should i eat those offerings the master is telling it won't injure you if the offerings are given out of love for god out of love for god but they are harmful if they are given with any selfish motive so that is also the ramanujacharia he has also said in that way the sparsha dosha jaati dosha etc etc so that is some idea bhagavan's is telling most of the people they offer food to god with some prayer so if you please accept these fruits and these sweets and please bless my child who is suffering in this or that these are the things are very risky if we are accepting if they are offering to god with love that is pure but someone is dead in the memory of that person they are cooking some food and giving and praying to the god whatever he or she has done please forgive like that like that those who will accept those food will have to share that is the idea some people may believe or not believe that is the idea if you are accepting that offering you have to share those things now how we will understand as a sannyasi we are all the time receiving and we are surviving on that the donation and charity so we don't we don't earn ourselves we don't have any business or no service no salary how we will survive obviously the devotees they are bringing the food they are bringing the gift all the clothings everything they give shall we accept it or not so this is the question now sirama krishna when the kedar told can i eat those offering sirama krishna told reply that if they are pure they are offering to god with love no problem but with some selfish attitude selfish motive then of course you should be careful kedar is a very intelligent man how he is replying i have explained everything to the devotees and now i feel relieved i have told them that he who has given me his blessings knows all he means bhagavan sirama krishna who has given me blessings bhagavan sirama krishna he knows all so whatever you are bringing i am offering to bhagavan sirama krishna suramar krishna was in life he was leaving that time even then people started worshipping him as the god so suramar krishna once told maha sharadamani devi when people will be worshipping me and when you will find that i am accepting food to each and everyone from every and everyone the i am going to close my divine play that means he will go away from this he will die like that so it is 1885 that we are reading 1886 he passed away now one thing sirama krishna smiled when he said the ramakrishna smiling that is true you see people of all shirts come here so they find here different things but the god it is obvious so what we do the same question he asks to our the one of the presidents of the order the 10th president of the ramakrishna modern mission and one of our brahmacharya swamiji the if people are offered giving us something other food and all these things if we accept that so naturally we are accepting their responsibilities also sharing is that good then sudama krishna answered offer it to it's swami virus answered offer it to bhagavan srirama krishna then be free here we find the kedar is also doing the same thing if anything anyone is giving either mentally or physically just offer it to god and say i don't know i have offered it to god and naturally it is all pure now i can eat so this bhagavatam krishna is mentioning i don't need to know different things kedars kedar is telling so many people are coming over here to different type of the same thing happened when ma sharadamani devi she used to carry the food for bhagavan si ramakrishna almost all of you know those who are the students of the life of sirama krishnamasharada this is a very famous incident that happened and that disclosed the characteristic of mahasaratha muni devi srama krishna he used to eat from the hand of very chosen people those who are very pure in his body and mind from their hand only otherwise it was difficult for him so mice to carry the food then one day when she was carrying suddenly one lady came almost snatched the food from her the plate from her and said ma give it to me i like to offer it to the girl sirama krishna so he she took it and went to inside and gave it to him and left srama krishna could not touch that food could not pick up that food or forget about eating mother was there masha adamani devi and she was fanning him then that this that were so you know that i cannot eat from anyone and everyone so obviously knowing this why you have given this plate to her and she was not a good character now today i won't be able to eat mother was going on fanning and insisting today you please eat then she said two things two statements if anyone call me as mother and ask me for anything i won't be able to say no to him or her this is a great blessings anyone just calling out the mother as the child she is the child is coming to the mother asking for something the same way and second thing she told are you only do you only belong to me you are god you belong to each and every one this shows the wonderful characteristics and the spirituality of martial devi usually people they always try to grab try to hold anyone anywhere in the astoma you will find anyone doing something slowly slowly will be holding everything and will not allow others to enter to do anything because they think that they will lose their importance that means anything that you are trying to hold that is your samsari manavrati for all everything is temporary things are going to change that why you are trying to hold it and moreover when the god is there when people are coming to god who am i to say no to them so that was not there then that is the reason mahasaratha manidevi without hesitations though sirama krishna was her husband she could be say okay i will take care of everything about you and all this i won't allow anybody to touch your food i only will bring but no anyone can come and anyone can offer you food i am just one of them i am also a humble devotee like them so this is the beauty of the mothers so that is called the spirituality and here the explain like that i don't need to know different things kedar is telling that i only want to know that there is only one god and all the different things i don't want to know at all masters smiling why not one should know a little of everything if a man starts a grocery shop he keeps all kinds of article there including a little lantern and turmeric also master is telling like that so you should know of different things of the philosophy but kedar is very dedicated at the same time with this statement bhagavan si ramakrishna is teaching the one should not be closed mind that is also a dangerous thing in the spirituality the people start thinking whatever god or god is i have accepted that is the only god and goddess and i i don't believe in any other gods or goddesses that is dangerous attitude if they say there may be other gods and goddesses of course and whatever the path the other people are following and leading dubai i don't have any objection but i like this particular aspect of god or goddess and i like to follow this path no problem so that is the thing though that narrowness should not be there whatever i have accepted whatever i have understood that is the only path that is the only god or god is now that is dangerous and in that attitude one cannot develop the spirituality in within oneself and at the same time they harm the whole atmosphere of the spirituality so suramar krishna is never accepting this ramakrishna is telling different paths are there and god like that god has created that different religion different people different things god like it who am i to say the god only wants this color god only wants this food god only is in this form who am i it's a blasphemy it's going against god we should understand it those who are telling it they're telling it from their ignorance and from their ego suramar krishna never mentioned that so this gospel of sadama krishna that is the parliament of religion in his own life in his own teaching he is telling it's good that you like me but at the same time yeah you should also have the respect about others you should also know that sudama krishna left the room and then afterwards a devotee said can one know god's attributes through the intellect what are the god's attribute the guna in sanskrit they say it's goona these are all attributes he is all-pervading he is all-powerful he is all merciful like that like that so all these attributes all these gunas the qualities is it possible to understand through intellect sirama krishna certainly not by this ordinary intellect why is telling this suddenly not by this ordinary intellect but the buddhi the intellect that when it is all jumbled up mixed up with so many worldly ideas so many worldly things it is very difficult to concentrate to understand the god that's why he is telling like that it should be completely purified ordinary intellect he said and how to purify it by taking the holy name of god by knowing about god by pondering about god and or meditating on god by that way slowly slowly slowly the mind becomes completely detached from the worldly things so what is divinity anything which is not worldly is divinity now on this there's this statement anything is there any other thing except god which is not temporary no everything is temporary everything is changing that means it is only god that's why the vedanta they say of course they don't say god they say atman they say that brahman atman paramatman these are the terminologies of the yogis brahman that is the terminology of the gyanis bhagavan ishara is a terminology of the devotees so all that constantly the three paths the hindus they follow so so many different way constantly they are going on telling sometimes we are con very eager to know about the religion and studying small small group they are studying and trying to understand and trying to talk to the swamis to get it clear explanation like that so they were asking the what is this mukti from the point of view of the duality from the point of view of the non-duality or the how the creation came who is brahma and who is hirana garbha so i was wondering so they are very much interested nowadays and slowly slowly these knowledges are coming and cleaning all this thought about spirituality thought about religion it's a very clean idea clear idea so sirama krishna when he asked certainly not by ordinary intellect so suppose a very intelligent uh some scientist really able to understand no because the worldly thoughts are there in my mind so when there's a worldly thoughts are there in the mind i cannot so rishis they used to go inside the jungle avoiding any company all alone they will be there why to completely free their mind from the worldly thoughts when the worldly thoughts are there it is very difficult but now what we should do we cannot go like the rishis we are in the society we have to work then we can take the holy name of god and when we are going on taking the name of god it is automatically purifying our mind and though right this moment we cannot understand but slowly slowly it will purify any time will come will be disgusted with all these worldly things and thoughts so and the mind will con go back to its original state so that is what bhagavan srama krishna is telling can one know god so easily now his ramakrishna is telling one must practice sadhana what is the sadhana yama niyama these two we have to practice and in this yamanyama means the shocha shantosha ahimsa all these things we have to practice then only slowly we'll be able to purify our mind one must also adopt a particular attitude towards god for instance the attitude of his servant towards his master the rishis of the old had the attitude of shanta do you know the attitude of the gyanis it is to meditate on one's own self now in these three lines ramakrishna is mentioning attitude that it towards the god what the ghani they do they don't think about god they think about the self didn't think about the atman they go on that their meditation means they're constant they're concentrating their mind to understand who am i that much and constantly they are judging the mind i am not the body that is for sure i am not these bones and all this blood and it is it is not possible that i am that because it is all afterwards it will rotten it will go away so who am i then then they will be discussing about the abuse etc that is the way they do the ghani's what the rishi's attitude the attitude that means they will be taking that stand what is the rishi's attitude shantha what is the shanta attitude they are not disturbed with anything now this pandemic is going on people are dying people are thinking what i should do what i should not do and sometimes they are going on purchasing so much of this uh senate sanitary things and all that and stalking thinking that it will be necessary afterwards it is so difficult so this is the way that people always think that i should only survive whether the other people how they survived it is up to them i am going to survive only and my kit and keep my family so this selfish attitude that they take always so why they are thinking that we can live forever no one can live forever it is not possible so obviously that truth when we know and things are constantly changing understanding that well what to do as best as possible we'll try this best scientists best minds they are bringing out the medicine and other things whatever they say will try to do and then whatever happens happen what to do why should i be so much afraid and so much crying and so much blaming so what is that so this is the way the rishis always quiet and calm they are not at all disturbed for anything that is called the rishi attitude now here the shanta the attitude of the gyanis but then he said about the the servant he wants to serve the guru he wants to serve the god from the in his mind it is there their attitude is like that so the normal thing they will go and they will serve and they feel joy in that when they are serving and they are purified by that way now srirama krishna this is a unique thing that we not we can notice over here srama krishna smiling you have to to a devotee he is answering that that is to a devotee with a smile what is your attitude this devotee is our master mashay who is the recorder of this gospel of krishna the conversation what is your attitude the devotee gave no answer he was confused perhaps and in he knew that krishna knows so you're quite master smiling you have two attitudes you meditate on your own self those who are reading the gospel of krishna in the beginning you will find master musa is raising question is it possible can one be the dualist at the same time nondualist etc exeter is bachara is there when the surama krishna is asking he said ghani attitude what do you like the ghani attitude the path of knowledge i like it so that the sudama krishna is telling you have two attitude that one is you meditate on your own self that means the ghani and also cherish towards god the attitude of a servant cherished towards god is a duality the first one gany attitude non-duality and when towards god is the duality and it is a servant attitude master masha is very humble and every time he wanted to serve bhagavan sriram krishna am i am i not right he is asking the devotee hesitating and smiling yes sir the master mashay he knew this krishna will know then sadam krishna like a child is very happy he is telling you see hasra says i can read people's thoughts hazrat said there was another person who was there as if sudama krishna himself didn't know anything the hasra gave him that certificate you can read people's thoughts one can maintain those two attitudes only at a very advanced stage now we will know about the master master why suramar krishna is to like him so much whatever suramar krishna said he followed the win one day the master masha he was a the poor teacher in those days there was no much salary for the teachers and he wanted to give some money for the service of masharadha mani devi or srama krishna or poor people he wanted to do that so he took the permission from suramar krishna asking can one should try to earn more money sirama krishna gave the permission yes why not but with proper method not by stealing or anything but proper method if you can earn is good then he said with that money you can help many other people master mashay used to work in three different schools and that means you can understand when someone is going and giving the class it's so tiring and in different schools and different classes used to go whole day and then earning little money from the first school whatever he used to get their salary is to give it to mahasarathamani devi for her maintenance because sadhana devi was having also so many other ladies so she needed some money to maintain that a second school whatever the salary that he used to give to the direct disciples of bhagavan sinama krishna by that time srama krishna passed away and these young boys they were in great difficulty people were not believing them they're like this master masha quietly is to help them third school whatever the salary he used to get is to spend it for his own family and his children so that is the great thing see because of this great mental attitude this master moshe has also become immortal along with bhagavan's rama krishna as long as the people will be knowing bhagavan sirama krishna will be knowing masharadamani devi swami vivekananda and others master mashay will be remembered and not only that after him his family his grandchildren grandsons they are also great people very broad-minded people they have given that house where master masha is to leave donated to ramakrishna mission so that people can come people are interested to know these householder devotees they know all the monks the sannyasi devotees of bhagavan siddharama krishna but what about the householders devotees so give that house to ramakrishna mission very humble house but there he is to meditate he used to write and this wonderful book that he wrote for us and for the posterity for the eternity people will be reading and knowing about the spirituality suramar krishna knew that he was a great person and here he is indicating this two completely different attitude one attitude completely as a divalest and servant attitude at the same time he is a gyani is very difficult to combine these two attitude the mohave anumanji the ramachandra's devotee he was having this attitude the sudama krishna let me give you an illustration and then he is telling like this that a person who is going on uh the holding the thorns and he is bleeding and he is trying to say nothing has happened to me that is not the gyana the many people they can bear in the pains of the body so they will be beating their own body and their lying on the nails and like that so many people can do that type of things though difficult of course but through practices people they learn but that is not the attitude of the ghani that is not the attitude of the devotee love for god an attitude to serve him so that the god becomes happy comfortable so that is one attitude i am that god completely different but combine these two must be a very great person now master moshe is writing the account of the sunday february 22nd 1885. the god's birthday i have given the title celebration of the god's birthday can god take birth the whoever is taking birth means he is going to die that means any abutara there is there the power of god the supreme god the ramachandra or the krishna they are taking that the human form as if taking the human form the shankaracharya is mentioning in his gita this explanation the he is telling evil as if not that truly not that really but as if he took that human form and appeared before us as a human so when he is in that human form as because he is not having any karma faller so obviously he is not like us we are bound to take birth so who is going to finish the karma follow the result of our action whatever good and bad we have done because i have to bear it i have to suffer i have to enjoy but the god has nothing like that he is not having any karma of allah then why he will born the abathara is abu taran out of his own will he is manifesting himself but take the help of a man and a woman as if any other human being their born then in the life of jesus also we find this type of the words that that sometimes some people are confused the how it is possible the virgin mary conception of the virgin mary but he was she gave the birth of the jesus the people will be wondering some other non-believers they will be doubting about that god's birth is like that because he's all powerful he can't create him like that but he takes the help of a man and a woman and as if they are their his parents they hear the ramachandra the krishna the our lord jesus bhagavan sirama krishna with that way so they are not born the born means the beginning of that and they are not going to die but still we love to celebrate the birthday the birthday that means on that particular day he manifested in that particular form so krishna the janmaster me and that will be celebrated by the hindus the followers of the krishna and all decorations all that so who is being helped by that we the devotees we are remembering god we are the purchasing different things to present to god we are meditating we are singing the bhajans we are discussing about that by that way our mind is purified the sirama krishna the god himself in the form of a human being ashirama krishna so today their devotees they have gathered to celebrate the sunday february 22nd but the birthday was the one day before that they are telling sirama krishna was sitting on the northeast baranda outside his room at the nation it was about eight o'clock in the morning many were present they were celebrating the master's birthday which had fallen on the previous monday aim arrived and saluted him the master signed to him to take a seat near him narutam was singing naruto was a very good singer he was singing kirtan see ramakrishna was in partial ecstasy the ecstasy means the slowly slow the mind is merging with that words of the song that song the wind they are describing the song means some description some words that they are expressing through the music and melody so that sudama krishna is following and slowly slowly merging with that and he's going into ecstasy forgetting the represent the subject was krsna's meeting with his cowherd frames in the meadow krishna had not yet arrived the cowherd boys were restless for him one of them said the mother yasoda was preventing krishna from coming then balaai said he is determined in a determined voice that he would bring krishna with the sound of his horn and balay love for balai's love for krishna knew no bound the music went on the cowherd boys and girls hard krsna's flute and were filled with spiritual emotion so when the the i don't know whether how many of you have heard this kitten they'll be describing also they'll be singing in between the song they will be describing what is happening it's just like a storytelling and those who can understand that will be deported almost in the psychological mentally to that particular time of krishna and you can visualize when you are closing your eyes and listening to that kirtan and if that singer is a wonderful not one there will be group they'll be singing and sometimes they're talking and as if like this the balla is telling telling the i will blow my this horn and immediately krishna will come because he knew that i'll be waiting here etc etc so that is the way situation is each and everyone is eagerly waiting for the lord krishna to come and someone as the friends they always do they were thinking that the mother yasoda is not allowing krishna to come in the middle to play so this is the situation and for the devotee of lord krishna is a great event so they will be transported to that particular time and enjoy salama krishna's mind also he liked that song and suddenly sudama krishna's eyes fell on narendra narendra means afterwards swami vivekananda who was sitting very near him he stood up and went into samadhi he stood there touching narendra's knee with his foot regaining consciousness he took his seat again narendra left the room the music went on sirama krishna whispered to baburama there is a kid in the room give narendra some the special attention for the narendra why because noreen was not an ordinary soul he was also the sheba in that human form krishna knew that so sometimes he used to go and sometimes you know when the physical body there there may be some other thoughts the god is blessing in that way he went and touched him with his holy feet and narendra he could bear that it's not not that everyone can do that narendra could bear it without showing any external changes only after that when the lord went and sat narendra also went out because that was really a very very that experience of the touch of god so he wanted to enjoy it all alone he went out suramar krishna is asking baburam to feed him with some kheer here we understand the love for narendra did master see narendra as the embodiment of god master mashay he is the writer he is observing every movement of krishna he is listening the song he is observing who is doing what at the same time this is a graphic description as if the movie those who can really imagine they can imagine and can go to that particular time when all these things are happening that's why master mashay swami vivekand was elated when he read this he told you are excellent everything he gave the description and because narendra was there but the master musha is writing these and when that young narendra became famous bibayakananda and when he read master mashed by that time published this it's writing in a book and vivekananda read that he himself could feel yes this happened so that is the way master masha's description so graphic so clear so this is the uniqueness of the gospel of sudama krishna did the master see narendra as the embodiment of god after the kirtan sudama krishna returned to his room tenderly he began to feed narendra with swedes it was girish belief that god himself had been born in the person of sri ramakrishna when the others they they were doubting they were thinking that is a great soul no doubt but god no it cannot be the god means he must be having some miraculous power and salam krishna never showed anything like that the one gentleman came here and he was telling this why you were worshiping sirama krishna he was a great sage no doubt but not god you know how to i asked him uh what is your idea about god how do you think the god should behave like the krishna the krishna lifted the whole hill in a finger like that the superhuman power special power should be manifest then only we can accept that person as a god i will see nowadays the huge crane the powerful machine can lift the whole hill can we worship that machine as god just that if that is the year stick that god if to become god one has to lift the hill then this is dangerous machine will be doing that nowadays it is not that the god is love for krishna it was necessary we have to understand that so ramuchandra didn't show any miraculous power because it was not necessary he came for different purpose he wanted to give the shape of the human society and the krishna came by that time the people they were in two minds can god come down from the heaven on the earth many they were not ready to believe at the time of sri rama chandra see ramachandran never wanted to tell these that i am god when the rishis from their pure their side they could understand the sri rama is that same supreme god rama asked them not to disclose it bhagavan salam krishna also mentioned that even he asked the hanumanji not to disclose that because anumanji was a great at the yogi he could see that in rama that's supreme power that supreme lord but rama was behaving just an ordinary person to give a shape to the human society krishna came and it was necessary for him to show this miraculous power to develop the faith god can be in the human form so there is a wonderful discussion the how the god slowly coming down for our benefit and then it is bhagavan sirama krishna now time has changed people idea was very clear many people are educated that not only at the time of krishna that the 18th 19th century now the present day slowly people are understanding this it is man within the man that atman is there so that is the main purpose the cerama krishna's manifestation was completely different it was not necessary for him to show the miraculous power though he has done it a very ordinary person very very ordinary he was a servant he became the brahma-gyani just by the grace of bhagavan si ramakrishna there are so many out there examples are there this girish understood and he declared at that time sirama krishna is god there's a the many people used to debate with girish and girish was very then powerfully used to say sirama krishna didn't say yes or no and many of you you know the salaam krishna himself asked this question to girish on the 1st january 1886 the year that he passed away and there he asked girish you go and tell people that i am god what have you seen why you say like that then the girish told how can i explain it in the ramayana in the mahabharata those great sages could not explain that about god they only felt the same thing here i am an ordinary girish i feel that you are god but i cannot explain it sudama krishna went into ecstasy you know that and whoever came and touched him immediately whatever the prayer they had the wishes they had that was fulfilled so sirama krishna is god girish was announcing his girish is telling it was girish believed that god himself had been born in the person of sri ramakrishna girish to master your ways are like krsna's he too pretended many things to his mother yashoda sirama krishna not giving much importance into that is still true it was because krishna was an incarnation of god when god is born as man he acts that way you see krishna easily lifted the hill of govardhana with his hand but he made nanda believe that he that he found it very hard to carry a food tool that that is the way as a child is showing his father that i cannot carry this small the stool foot toll and the father had to come and lift i'm a child how can i carry but the same person lifted them so that is the god's way they do the abutara they do suramar krishna is accepting the krsna's activity and because of his abutara his god girish yes sir i have understood you now sirama krishna was sitting on the small couch it was about 11 o'clock rama and other devotees wanted to dress him in a new cloth and there is a birthday celebration the master said no no pointing to an english educated man who is this english educated man our master mushai so now krishna is too mentioned in this way a devotee master english educated man so he used to talk mention him in dal this way he said what he says about it at the earnest request of the devotees he said well since you insist i shall have to agree so they were dressing him why master masha master masha had doubt can god be in human form as a human the ordinary way the person is behaving sometimes he is good sometimes he is angry sometimes he is talking with people in a completely different way the important subject suramar krishna is to do like that all the time so he used to think is he god truly so naturally the why master mashay we will also won't be able to believe a person before us like sirama krishna than thinking that he is god we don't know god the girish had that faith and understanding very clear understanding so he never deviated from his own point rambabu was also ram datta he also used to say this ramakrishna is the god himself because of their great faith master moshe was in two mind he used to try to understand thing after analyzing as because he had the attitude of the gyani this is natural is normal even when swami vivekananda came and he introduced the service as worship it is master musa he said no krishna never said like that and he was not agreeing with the narendra though he had a great respect for narendra vivekananda it was only mother martial devi when she said whatever the naren is doing this ramakrishna's work then master masha told okay now no doubt so by that way the master mache so when they wanted to dress him like that and worship like that sirama krishna pointed to him and said to what he this english educated person why doubtful people why english educated because in the old fashion they will be having the guru and the worshipping the feet of guru and then offering food and all those things then this type of modern education they'll think oh that is useless why a man should be worshipped like that and this is the salaam krishna said the devotees were arranging the master's meal in the room and he asked narendra to sing narendra sang in danes darkness oh mother thy formless beauty sparkles is a beautiful song about the mahakali sudama krishna was the goddess kali him himself the goddess kali the concept of goddess kali is nothing but the knowledge and action together parabru so this is the concept what is parabrahma the full knowledge para shakti when that knowledge is now transforming into action acting that is the parashakti it is not the man and a woman a sheba or the kali not like that it is that particular aspect of god he knows everything but not functioning so we call him shiva when that shiva starts functioning we call kali so sirama krishna is the kali so naturally when narendra is singing and when in particular the one sentence when you were singing who are thou mother seated alone in the shrine of samadhi samadhi means where there is nothing this nirvikalpa samadhi there's in the yoga sutra they say there are two types of samadhi mainly one is swabi kalpa another is nirvikalpa nirvikalpa means without taking the help of anything just merging into that consciousness so that is who are tao sirama krishna went into deep samadhi and lost all outer consciousness the immediately after that the mentioning about this extreme point that ramakrishna is merging into that his physical form is standing people can see that particular form but inside that mind is merging into that consciousness it is really really very rare very rare to see so that's why bhagavan sadama krishna is unique much afterwards swami vivekananda after constantly trying to understand analyzing and examining afterwards he said i never saw anything which is really really real original in anyone in this world except krishna so that is the sudama krishna he is marching into that who is srama krishnadeen makali that those who have read the biography of krishna you know and that there's the incident of that happened in the uh the shampoo body so this way also krishna showed that sirama krishna is kali sometimes some people they come and ask why don't you keep a picture of goddess kali because the suramar krishna worshiped kali that you should also worship kali you say yeah we are worshiping kali we are worshipping kali in the form of krishna the most difficult to understand you know we we only take that particular uh the murthy that form that picture then we think this is kali kali should have four hands kali should have this uh the munda mala the the the skulls the girl and they're not like that it is the aspect that we have to understand shiva and shakti the ones matur nath vishas who is to support sudama krishna that jamindar landlord he was sitting in his own the building and there was a little space and then suramar krishna was walking on that open space the baranda up and down mathurba was thinking oh i am supporting this man he looks so ordinary by spend so much money for him and say or so much of pay so much of respect is he truly really as a highly spiritual person the mathurbabu's like him matu babu suddenly saw that afterwards he himself declared that when sudama krishna is walking down he was like a sheba shiva is working again when he's going opposite it is the goddess kali in the same person motherboard jumped from his chair and ran across that open space and fell honestly baba please forgive me i doubt it this krishna is eunuch and we are celebrating the birthday of that god who is eternal who has no birth no death then whom we are actually worshipping and celebrating the birthday his human form it is bhagavan sinha krishna friends that we will read from here in our next class i think there are some questions are there let us answer but read little loudly so the first question is from she is asking how can we remember god when we are busy doing things like working or reading was a good question and our grade that swami the first president of the order that our swami brahmanandaji he has given the wonderful prescription about that he said when you go to office carry a small picture of aguans ramakrishna then before starting the work just take out that picture from your wallet and then look at it start your work in between when you are taking a little break take out that once again and look at it and then take the rest or coffee etc after finishing your work when you are returning to your home take out that picture and say god you have given me this job i have done it today i offer it at your feet please be with me and that will do thank you the next question is from she is asking often there are people who pray to god take mantra continue to behave in a very similar way being harsh jealous towards others why they are not creating wholesome attitude like master motion that is very very difficult though they have taken the initiation now after taking the initiation and after following the instructions of the guru and you are very correct a change should come must come otherwise there is some mistake in practice and what are the changes all good qualities so obviously when they are very jealous maybe the intensity that has come down feeling jealous but little that's a great help that's a the great advancement we can say but you are very correct we should always remember that taking the initiation and repeating the name of god that should be proved in our character in our thoughts in our behavior day-to-day behavior each and every one should try to imbibe the good qualities then only the blessings of god will come thank you the next question is from gita bashu she is asking how was sri ramakrishna enlightened i don't know what is this question he was god himself so enlightenment that is from him only it comes and enlightenment means that we are all gods that's why bhagavan sirama krishna told as to his near and dear another circle those who really understood those whose mind became purified and i always say again and again if you are following my class you you must have heard the purification of the mind means giving up the thoughts of the worldly things so those who are thinking too much of the worldly things the name fame money property the physical comfort well it will take some time for them to understand not that they won't be able to but it will take some time for them and when that is not there those people they see the image of god they can feel the presence of god and sudama krishna is the god himself and this is called enlightenment he was that light bishwaroo ghosh he has a comment he's saying oh what a splendid way you can express the time and feeling are you a member of the gods at the time of sriram krishna he's asking you i wish i was there but i don't know so thank you for the compliment but i wish i was there but one thing is sure one thing is very sure and again as because bhagavan sirama krishna said if anyone in his life lifetime once sincerely pray to god will come to sirama krishna's ideology suramar krishna's philosophy sincerely once i must surely must have done once in my life so please pray for me and may god bless me so that this is the life and now it is almost complete a little few more years maybe so we must go back i must go back to the source which is known as bhagavan sadama krishna thank you the next question is from devjanidhar she's saying is it possible to place the frame of lord shiva mata lakshmi and lord krishna along with swamiji oh yeah why not sure sure so see that the the images of the lord shiva and the lakshmi that is imaginative we do not know but what is godly quality what is shiva that is love for the humanity sacrifice isn't it when they were churning the ocean and the poison came out who is the god who saved us shiva who is the sheba never care for the name or fame or the beauty or anything always merged in that ultimate knowledge but when necessary immediately coming for help that neela kanta the name that he got so that is the shiva not that particular form that is an imagination whether he was that muscular or not some people would make the very muscular shiva whether he was having a snake hanging from his neck or not we don't know they're just imagining that lakshmi the same way what is the lakshmi those who are really good and that she is bestowing the wealth or what is that wealth containment wealth doesn't mean all the time the money and all that it is necessary to survive but contentment is the main thing i am sufficiently oh god you have given me so much and i am very happy so that is called the wealth the same way and we find that all these qualities in bhagavan sri ramakrishna maharaja why should he not call them god why can't he also place them by the side of shiva mahalakshmi thank you friends let us chant this mantra and we conclude is namaste
