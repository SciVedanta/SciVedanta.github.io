let us begin with the prayer this is on page 48 of this book the universal prayer the universal prayers first one on that page this shanti mantra is from the upanishads [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] may all aspects of my personality including the body mind sense organs the prana shakti vital force may all become stronger and function in perfect consult this whole physical universe which is pursued by the mind through the sense organs is nothing other than the ultimate reality described as brahman in the upanishads may i not reject this truth this has been verified by experience due by innumerable sages this truth may i accept it as a hypothesis to begin my spiritual sadhana spiritual practices to experience this truth by myself in this very life as i am engaged in this noble effort of experiencing my true divine nature may all the virtues described in the upanishads come to me and reside in me may all the virtues such as truthfulness strength purity state forwardness may all those virtues come to me and reside in me om peace may there be peace and joy in our hearts may there be peace and harmony amongst all beings [Music] good morning and welcome to all of you uh to continue our study of the ashtavakra teachings of establishment we have been uh studying this uh uh for a couple of times we met but this may be the third meeting so far we have studied some practical instructions that astrakha has given his main teaching is advaita organs i am the self i am the utman infinite eternal formless attributeless pure consciousness but before he gives that message ashtanakara gives a few practical instructions by way of preparation this was in response to janaka's question this book ashtav krishnamita is in the form of a conversation between the between two brahmagyanis very interesting one is janaka the king emperor who was a brahmagyani and ashtavakra force from birth even b from before birth he was a brahmana so that story we studied earlier how he happened to be called as ashtavakra the body became bent in eight places and all the story part we have done now janaka's question the book begins with the question from janaka he says how to get liberation how to get vairagya these questions uh janaka asks how to get self-knowledge in response to these questions from janaka six instructions in one's lookup this loka number two in the first chapter the sixth instructions are the practical teachings that we all have to and can and have to practice as a foundation for our spiritual life the first thing that janaka that ashtavakra says is if you wish to have liberation astral process if you want to have liberation then first thing you have to do is you have all attachment to all sense objects which i almost there's a second verse in the book first chapter which means all sense objects everything other than the self is a sense object including the body our mind and everything so we'll discuss that one as if it is poison it is attachment to sense objects that the cause of all misery in human life all limitations all misery life after life first instruction give up attachment to send subjects which says you have sense objective you say on you cannot give sense objective something we have to our body itself is sense object how can we give it up we need food to eat clothes to wear things so what he meant is to give up attachment to these things you can have the things that we need but no attachment because they are not they are not ours they are they have a purpose we use them for a certain purpose and that's it we should not uh seek happiness in the sense objects since subjects do not have an inherent capacity to give us any lasting unconditional eternal happiness only atman can give five more things to do this is one thing not to do not to have attachment you have sense the same sloka second verse he says means nectar the turmeric that gives us immortality what are the things we have to pursue he says this all of this we studied earlier i'm just quickly reviewing them forbearance forgiveness [Music] state forwardness total transparency in your personality what i think in my mind should be reflected in my speech speech and thought must be same and what i say in words i must follow it up in action action must be same as what what i say what i say must be same as what i think the state foreign also several places shri krishna mentions our jebum as an important virtue for a spiritual seeker compassion towards all beings compassion should be based not upon in not in a condescending way but recognizing the same divinity in all the bodies are different necessarily forms are different pursuits are different but essentially there is only one divinity present in all that is the basis for all human relationships dosha means contentment remaining content with what we have what comes unsolicited whatever comes on its own with that we have to remain content the opposite of contentment is greed the desire to acquire more and more hoping that more will more possessions will bring more happiness that's not true at all most important virtue truthfulness this is one virtue that everyone whether we are seeking spiritual realization or not just remaining in the world pursuing the worldly activities everyone has to pursue this this is patanjali calls satyam as masada union of universal relevance and universal and eternal relevance relevant in all places under all circumstances at all times written can never be changed sriram krishna said in the kali practice these things as if they are nectar that is the practical part of ashtavakra's instruction now before he goes to the main topic he gives one more instruction that is in the 11th uh sloka 11th verse of the first chapter very important instruction that applies to all of us then there he says something that is already known very well intuitively he says what you think that you will become this that he makes it simple here what you think that you become this is loka number 11 first chapter the arashtavakra says [Music] very important instruction a very important instruction a place to all of us he says means liberation freedom from all suffering all limitations freedom from the cycle of birth and death liberation salvation moksha mukta bhimani one who thinks that he is free positive person i'm free what can bind me nothing binds me i'm the child of god i'm a servant of god i'm a devotee of god what can afflict me that's such a person muktabhi what happens to such a person he becomes free and the opposite also but means a person always think oh i am i have such problem i'm bound i'm limited this is my problem i cannot do any progress i'm stuck i'm suffering so this kind of thinking but happy money what happens to such a person but though he remains bound so what we should do we have to change our thoughts we'll come to that the second line in this eleventh sloka he says concluding instruction means what they say voice people people who know the truth who have experienced the truth what they say is true what did they say as you think so you become gatima's destination where we go what happens to us that depends upon what we think but it means mind but also means our thoughts as i think so i become this is very important instruction you say kimadanti means an adage in a day is a statement reflecting common wisdom based on experience instead of given [Music] given to us by sages wise people what they say for example in conversation we say they say that exercise is essential for good health they say they means who those who have done exercise have benefited from it like that one that's key modern thing that that came within that a day is true that what you think that you become this is proven by experience a person who constantly entertains negative thoughts i am sick i am limited i am around this problem or a person who always is angry greedy jealous those negative qualities are reflected in the body a person who is always angry can have hypertension a person who is always stressful can have stomach problem acidity like these are called psychosomatic diseases diseases reflected in the body because of improper negative thinking that you know from experience the constantly affirming on in in the opposite to do the opposite constantly affirming i'm a child of god i'm a child of the king of kings i've taken his name what can reflect me i'm well by constantly thinking in this way then we remain well person remains well you thinks like that one this is also known from recent studies in neuroscience neuroplasticity that means the mind is our brain is malleable it can change our thoughts can change in neural connections in our brain new neural corrections can be formed at any age and that that way we can change what happens to us in our life then astrologers what do you think that you become in the in swamiji's karma yoga lectures the karma yoga book that was eight uh chapters the first chapter is called karma and character how our actions thoughts peace and actions shape our character that swamiji has explained nicely in the first beginning two or three paragraphs of this first chapter karma and character what i am this moment this personality you are saying in front of you sitting in front of you what i am this moment happy and happy you will illar well whatever this personality i have sculpted myself impression by impression over a long period of time whatever i have been thinking all thoughts even impression on the mind all actions leave an impression on the mind everything i say leaves an impression on my mind these impressions keep on accumulating and the sum total of all these impressions that i have gathered by my own actions for a long period of time is what is my personality today what i am is what i have made myself all my my own actions and thoughts and the impressions i have accumulated that means swamiji says you are the master of your own destiny you can become what you want to become but it's not a very quick process tomorrow morning when i wake up i don't become a very healthy knowledgeable wonderful person is a very slow process it has taken a long time for me to become what i am today life after life so we should start the process somehow from this moment onwards i'm going to think positively i'm not going to think any negative thought impure thought i'm not going to attend you entertain any negative thought or impure thought i'll repeat the god's name and my keep my mind pure by doing this gradually over a period of time slowly our personality changes that is uh the gist of ashtavakra's teaching yamato change your life change your thoughts and change your life the same thing is mentioned in the gita and this uh possibility of changing our future becoming the very best human being and achieving the goal of self-realization is available to everyone without any exception no one is borrowed from this possibility especially in the gita 9th chapter the one she krsna says even those who were indulged in very bad conduct over a period of time those who have been behaving well they will do well but what about those who obtain very bad deeds sinful actions out of ignorance and whatever can they also change your personality and say god yes affirmative action affirmative reply stick strangers this is there are two slokas in the ninth chapter so-called verse number 30 31 there bhagwan gives a very positive message very encouraging message for even ordinary people who have done some mistakes who has not done any mistake in life they can also change their life and achieve the goal of self-realization perfection dear bhagavan she krishna's chapter [Music] a person of bad conduct or very bad conduct appreciate even if a person has been like that he can change he or she can change the direction that person decides to pray to god constantly giving up all bad thoughts and habits what happens such a person that person has to be thought of as considered as a sadhu from that moment onwards just change his life how can this person who has been so bad can become a sadhu samyak that person is now has now changed his life and is on the right path established on the right path certain transformation or gradual transformation can happen you can see the example of this environment is life almighty was a hunter and while using violent means of livelihood supporting his family but narada and brahma they encountered him why are you doing such sinful lag do you think he says i want to support my family won't ask your family do they share your sins your sins are yours they are not going to share your sin while miku goes and doesn't come here that's true what you said so they teach him rama mantra repeat rama rama rama your full mantra is also difficult for him to chant because he doesn't have any background like that mall making he took it seriously he started chanting rama's name for a long period of time it took then what happened to him became the famous ramayana he wrote see such a transformation can happen even in the person's life if you pray to god think about god constantly such a person has to be considered a sadhus a month of you and it happen some sometimes it happens quickly it doesn't have to take a long time their next verse 31 [Music] such a person can experience eternal permanent peace peace that passage understanding they say it can happen to such a person then bhagavan says [Music] the last four words are very important but one game gives a promise original proclaim [Music] [Music] that important teaching ashtavakra gives before he begins his main teaching of advaita vedanta so that sloka is very interesting number [Music] um that's the thing to remember now he begins his uh from 12 onwards or even before refuse to look before 11 also abstract gives his main teaching directly he says the gist of his teaching is you are not the body you are not the mind senses and the five elements panchama you are not a brahmana or extraterrest we have classifications in society somebody brahmanas reaction sudra why she said none of those qualify the atman they are all referred to the body mind at best not to them you're the atman you're you're neither the doer of action no you are not a householder or a monk the four ashram was in the traditional way of thinking brahmacharya a student shapestone phase of life grastha grasthashrama householder's phase of life one of us rama repeated into the forest to contemplate on god it used to be like that in earlier times and finally sannyasa total dentition perceiving god full time that was how the four stages of life were uh considered in the earlier stages he says you're neither brahmacari or neither a all those are qualities of the body mind the mind say oh now i have taken sannyas until now i was a brahmacharya a household i am a promoter of brahmacharya now i'm married i'm a household uh i became householder now gross i'm married i will have a family and until then i was a brahmacharya like and then i will become an apartheid although sorry qualities of the mind changes that happen in the mind and body atman is not a brahmacharya not a sannyasin not a householder none of these things also he says you are neither the doer of actions nor the enjoyer of the fruits of your actions you're neither kartan or bhakta we are generally have a very strong feeling of agency doership i'm doing i'm doing this work i'm eating i'm walking i'm going to work i'm teaching i'm cooking all these actions we have strong feelings of kartrithwan notion that i am the doer that is only a property of the mind the mind test says i'm the do our body is instrument for all atman is neither the doer nor the enjoyer of the fruits of action when you do some action result will come necessarily good good bad bad none escape the law swamiji said in the song of sannyasi and who enjoys the uh or industry suffers the fruits of one section the person who does the actions both all of those none of those affect the atman you're free from all of this you're none of these things virtue and voice dharma dharma and dharma you are not those those belong to the mind the mind can be dharmic speech nothing qualifies you you're none of this you're the eternal witness of the whole universe then who am i if i'm not the body i'm not the mind i'm not the sense organs i'm not abbreviated i'm not a householder um i don't have dharma i don't have them i'm not the doer i'm not the enjoyer of the fruits of my actions none upanishad says this succinctly in several uh places some of them are maha matias upanishad says who you are he says me you are that brahman you are that and who is that not body mind not material nature but spiritual nature pragyanam pure consciousness there we can't understand up to that we know body mind sense organs action actually in all the fruit of action we can understand but what is pure consciousness you cannot define consciousness because consciousness is something that enables all actions to happen all definition all speech all actions happen only because of the presence of consciousness in consciousness in the body mind that's the root you cannot go back and explain the cause ultimate cause we makes everything which makes everything possible we'll examine that a little bit in detail later then before we go to that details two more things to be thought about why this knowledge is important so far i've been living i think i'm the body i'm the mind and somehow life is going on why should i suddenly start thinking i'm not the body body i'm not demanding why that is necessary that means why is that knowledge of the self necessary that i am the utman necessary because all suffering in human life any kind of suffering where intense suffering comes all limitations birth and death rebirth again all of these things happen only because of our ignorance of our true divine nature swamiji says famously each soul is potentially divine the divinity is remains potentially in everyone in everyone that is present even in inanimate objects in trees and animals and people good people bad people we can't be personally people same consciousness is there unconditionally if you know that then you are free from all suffering if you don't know if you spend our whole lifetime thinking i'm the body i'm the mind i'm such a person am i engineer i'm a doctor i'm a father i'm a son from this my house only probably these things if you keep on thinking full of limitations suffering is inevitable every kind of suffering that we experience in life can be traced to one ultimate cause namely ignorance of our true nature as the atman as brahman when that self knowledge is gained end of all suffering you can remember krsna's the parable in the gospel there he says he gives the parable of a lion cub which grew up thinking it was a shape among the sheep they will skip this story part we all know that one and the young cup grew up among the sheep doing what the shape did the sheep had grass it also had grass and whatever the ship did the lion cup also did moving among the group of land among the sheep and thinking it was a sheep it happened for some time then what happened the big lion comes and it is in search of four fish ship and says among the sheep this one lion is also there small again then the big lane catches all day small and why are you moving along the sheep are you are not a sheep you're a lion or ryan i don't know what elena i'm a sheep i am these are my brothers and sisters i grew up with them what is lion the land kept does not know what silence all this life was thinking it was a sheep very limited the lion teaches you know this story you are not a sheep you are a lion then when it realizes oh you look at me if reflection in the water the big lion says the small lane looks up the deflection its own deflection and the big lines reflections are both same only one is younger this oh i've been in again all my yes you have been a lion who told you you are a sheep that moment it changed began to experience this nature as a as a lion that's the truth like that we are doing upanishad says varshes are have been saying for centuries and millennia you are not the body or not a man you are the atman no limitations pure consciousness infinite eternal saccidananda all joy and bliss unconditional bliss eternal bliss infinite belief that you are and we are thinking no no i'm a human being i have this problem with that problem we are thinking let that lion come so the main goal of life is to know our true nature and not squander away this very precious gift of human birth all the time thinking i'm the body of the mind i'm this i'm the engineer i'm this person i was this problem or that problem you should that's not the truth it's far away from true truth is i am that that we have to experience so that is the goal of life why suffering is there because of ignorance of self-knowledge then what we should do goal of life is to realize our true nature this very precious human birth has been given to us most precious gift is human birth has been given to us with one purpose namely to realize our true nature as the uthman only as a human being we can't realize that one animals and plants and they cannot realize about their nature as not possible it's only from the human platform that we can rise to the divinity level of divinity which you truly are but is very precious shankaracharya says three things are very precious very difficult to accrue to the same person what are they much with mahapurusa these these three things are very very emitted not only just a human body there are so many human people apparently human having a human body but they don't have any human qualities they may have as if they are animal servers that won't do human birth human qualities what is human quality aspiration to rise higher to nowhere to true nature that must be there compassion love charity all these things are human qualities must be there that we that has been granted to us they deserve to know to dare to become free from all suffering so many sufferings afflict our us human beings and we desire we always try to become free strive to become free from sufferings but there is only one solution to that permanent solution to all problems of life and that is self-knowledge without self-knowledge gana they can't become free from all any limitation or any problem only that gives true eternal infinite indescribable peace and joy that's the goal of life if you don't do that one no matter oh the third thing is mahaprabhu the company in the guardians of a holy person that also has been granted to us by norma's grace of god many people don't have that facility all the three things necessary for realization has have been given to us so in spite of this having all these facilities if we don't do that one spend our whole life in ordinary bully pursuits then we will have squandered the most precious gift of human birth so the goal of life human life is to realize our true nature as atman brahman and become free from all limitations cycle of birth and death and everything stops in the brother anika panisha there's a nice the long nice conversation between maitreya is the householder greatest vedantin of that time he has two wives maitreya and after some time leading the householder's life again decided to go to one prastashirama that was the custom those days dhoni calls his two wives and says i've decided to go to rama no you all ladies have two choices you can either stay in this household you have to accumulate a lot of wealth gold coins and cattle those were the indicators of wealth those days because was the greatest scholar he had defeated many all the scholars of his time and he was rewarded all this money is their property cattle gold coins everything is there you can have this and stay or if you wish you can follow me to the forest in the forest you cannot take any of these things you have to live simply in a hut thinking only about god give your choice katyani says quickly she makes a permit no i don't want to go to forest with you i will stay here i'll take care of the property and uh this is what i want to do is fine your decision maitreya has some questions she has difficulty making a decision should i stay as a householder here and continue with the property everything or should i go to forest with my husband what should i do then my three asks a question what happens if i if i stay with the household i know i can have the property management but what happens if i go to the forest with you then aguimalka says you will get self-knowledge this all this money wealth and property these things cannot give you immortality immortality let me know your true nature is immortality body mind cannot be immortality utman is immortal knowing that experiencing it that cannot be acquired by wealth within tena nasty vitamins money will not bring that one after some consultation my three decides to go with her husband to the forest on the long teaching he teaches her agnes teaches his wife many many things there he says among other things the goal of life is to know our true nature which is which is eternal infinite pure consciousness brahman without reaching that goal if we lead whatever no matter however most famous we become powerful became rich we become none of this really is of any consequence while saying that one makes this very famous statement in the in their conversation long conversation he says to gargey yowan gargi awaited that person who lives this body departs from this world a smart local pretty depressed from this world it's not knowing this in eternal brahman aksharam brahma paramam brahman not knowing that leaves this world that means such a living worldly life and being successful such a person who is such a person upon wretched person will have wasted the most precious gift of human birth will not achieve anything all this name and favor and property possession position and power none of them is of any consequence on the other hand who has who has fulfilled the goal of life yoga that person who knows this truth about his true nature this parabrahman experiencing his divine nature then leaves the body departs from this world saha brahmana is a new arab brahman brahmajyan that's how important this knowledge is now let us read a few slokas from the first chapter where ashtanak argues the main teacher there are many slogans i'll read a few of them muktar be money we did that one astrologer says to janaka how to do this meditation you have to think in this way it says you're not the earth the five elements among them produce one of them akasha why you s these are five elements of which all physical universe is made our bodies are made of these five elements in the vedanta the periodic table is only by five elements in the chemistry periodic table they have more than 100 elements they are the basic constituents of everything in this universe the physical part you are none of these things is [Music] the witness of all these five elements witness of the whole universe everything that we are saying is a drishya is something that we are seeing objects of perception saying means only through all the five sense organs saying touching testing smelling hearing all these some objects which we can see pursue through there are objects and who is who the person who is saying is a sakshi is a witness witness cannot be witnessed that's the main point that is going to make islam sakshinam atmanam chitrupam of the nature of pure consciousness all this that we are seeing is material in nature material means they have a beginning and an end and they change every moment they are changing and they go out of existence your your pure consciousness mukta with you for liberation you have to know you have to concentrate or meditate on your true nature you're not the body you're not demanding you're not deficient organs you're none of these things more you drew from your consciousness know this for liberation then in andhras loka he says [Music] brahmana we have studied the vedas there are four levels four stages when a person is born just a infant being it has no vedic knowledge or anything like strawberry was an exception even in his boom of his mother he knew all debut doesn't but ordinarily when a baby is born it has no it doesn't it has to go to a preschool abcd one two three four then study the scriptures though how does it become a vipra pradika veda party baba not necessarily when one is born a brahmana family only when a person becomes brahmanyani brahmajanati brahmana like that one like uh said uh in the previous locum you're not you may have studied you're not that all that knowledge that we gain two kinds of knowledge all of that will fade away with age and then when this life ends that will also end if a person has a phd in this life then next life when the person born again and he cannot use their psd has to start from preschool abcd one two three four what happened to all these phd research and papers everything only with this life the end now we practical you are not the objects of perception visible to the eyes asangosi asanga means totally non-attached [Music] we are full of being are attachment human beings you're attached to everything we are attached to the body our thoughts our opinions the property we have house money uh cattle job family to all these things but brahmanyani is free from attachment to anything in brahman what attachment can be there how can pure consciousness have any attachment to anything everything else has form that's how we can see objects human being has a form that form keeps changing but form is there akara a part of the universe i am the witness separate from this witness means some someone who is watching something saying something so that seer has to be necessarily separate from the seen object in russia the seer is the druk the scene objects are seen objects necessarily they are different separate from each other if i'm saying in this book looking at this book i'm the seer and book is object i can't be the book that i'm seeing so you're saying are different this video is there they said that siri is not the same you saw knowing this so true happiness comes only by knowing our true nature as the atman at the witness the moment we descend into the field of drushia i'm the doer i'm the thinker i am the person who performs all actions i have this property of the disqualification i'm i'm such and such a person i'm a engineer i'm a father i'm a child the moment we listen to that level of duality that moment misery is guaranteed the only way to become truly happy enjoy two eternal infinite unconditional joy ananda is to give up all these attachments identific false identifications suki bhava knowing this one that you're the witness you're not the any of this other thing that you define yourself to be you are there knowing that one what happens who keep be happy like this ashtavakra gives more instructions we shall pursue this next time the one more thing before we leave all objects that are seen perceived their shift all of them change constantly they are changing they come into existence at a certain point in time everything you are seeing including our bodies was not there before before a certain point in time they all came into existence at a certain point in time including the world including universe big bang theory they say before that there no universe was there especially in time was all were also not there at some point they come into existence or the at some point later in time they all go out of existence inevitable in between many changes happen according to vedanta six changes happen to everything that comes into existence should be kara some of the this we have seen before anything that we see human body is the best example most we are more familiar with that one it goes through six changes it's a first changes coming into existence janma this book was not there always there at some point this book was made paper printing binding everything now it is there janma everything has a beginning birth then austin a state bomb everything exists for a finite duration of time people live up to 900 years and then animals will be even longer 120 years some trees live even longer thousand year old trees are there and then some things appear to disappear very quickly or birds and other small things they don't live very long and small small things subatomic particles they live only fraction of a second then they disappear disintegrate everything has a finite duration of existence justice second third thing is everything grows appears to grow see the child when before birth cell was not there child came into existence nice baby cute infant everybody appreciates what a cute infant like that one then it grows becomes a toddler and a preteen and the teenager and like this goes what the thing growth the next thing that happens is everything changes everything has been changing from beginning but we changes become appear apparent we notice changes a teenager becomes a young man then middle age and old age etcetera changes happen then what happened next change is fifth change is yet everything begins to degenerate everything has been degenerating from beginning but it becomes clear oh everything is going downhill at one point everything seems to be going going up growing and everything from strong middle age then everything slowly becomes goes downhill apache then what happens final change everything goes out of existence this applies to everything including the sun including the galaxy so many galaxies are there millions of them they all go through these exchanges galaxies form they grow and they exist for some time they change and then they disintegrate they merge into black color we don't know what happens after that one they no longer exist two galaxies collide with each other on changes seven these six changes happen to everybody only one thing is there that does not undergo any of these six changes not even birth it has always existed there's no date of birth for atman it always existed i will always exist in between does not change pure consciousness cannot change material things will change and you are that nirvikara you are the changeless eternal being remember that experience it and be happy and that is uh singular only one bodies are many uthman is one how can it be all different different people i am separate from you you are separate from others how can there be one this made clear in the gita in a simple way simpler way there is only one consciousness pervading all the bodies physically we are all different different different we have to be everybody's body is different but if you inquire into our true nature go deeper and deeper in true nature we all converge and become one spiritually a good example of this is how can something be different at one level same at another level a tree is given in the scriptures if you look at a big tree at the top you get the view of multiplicity so many different branches and sub branches streaks and so many different leaves and fruits and flowers and other things are there so many different different things multiple you go back trace them to the trunk level when they all converge into one trunk no matter how big the tree how many no matter how many branches are there trunk is only one the universe is somewhat like this all beings are different humans are different among humans so much variety everybody is different animals are different among you know animals there is so much variety and nature is so different also so now so different no two things are exactly alike even identical tools are not exactly alike you can there are differences [Music] but when you trace their origin where does the body come from what is this essentially but if you go deeper and deeper into inquiring to your true nature everything converges into one pure consciousness how do we know this one the scriptures are our main pramana proof is very simply put in a simple language the one she krishna said the same thing in the gita he says not only human bodies animal bodies plant bodies earth sun they're all creatures in all those bodies with the normality with one end willing spirit container ceremony content is one content is our essential content is pure consciousness container body they're all different different it's just like if you go to a kitchen so many pots and pans are there they're all different their forums are different their names are different their functions are different but in all of them only one space is there empty space is there space in the cup is not different from space outside the cup it's not different from space in the hall especially is not different from the space outside all one space appears to be divided in different containers 13th chapter thinks loka number 19. this pure consciousness utmon is indivisible only one cannot divide it into space cannot be divided into parts one space but it appears to be divided into different compartments and parts because it is seen in association with different containers for four different uh cups here parts and pans different sizes shapes and function everyone has the same space all of them have the same space yeah each space in the cup has a different shape and size depending on the container color if supposing the green glass empty glass the glass is green but the space inside the cup is not green it appears to be green from the outside green space but without the cup especially on the colors essentially colorless quality less but appears to acquire some qualities and shape and size because of the container and the association is very temporary utmon is one in all because of its association with many very different bodies of all different types of views animal bodies plant bodies saintly bodies look at people's bodies trees animals all contain only one container these are all containers this one up is a container what is the content only most important statement which is what is explained in the upanishads mentioned nicely simply in the bhagavad-gita so in this way
