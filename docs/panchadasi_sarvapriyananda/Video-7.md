[Panchadasi - Lecture 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojdfNDST358)

I said Oh leaders from the unreal to the real leaders from darkness unto light leaders from death to immortality oh you know Vedanta can simply be seen as a commentary to this pray the prayer which we did not unreal to real darkness to light death to mortality the whole of Vedanta is basically committed on this on this prayer now without knowing it you have made a lot of progress we are actually at verse number 54 now [Music] so verse number 53 is what I hinted at what I avoided this morning I do did you notice I mentioned mononym the phase of reasoning one example exists in today that the clash between non-dualism and the NIA a philosophy that's what's Internet verse number 53 if we have time you could have gone to that particular taken that one verse would have taken at least one full session now we are in a favorite phase of meditation verse number 54 the town near Beijing it's a gtasa kabba Taseer acre now that Swami thought he needed janabu today when that clarified meaning when the meaning has been clarified in this way what way by the by the method of hearing the teaching and their reasoning upon it what are teaching the method of the five sheets in particular which we talked about when that is clear no more objections remain no more doubts remain when that happens then we focused on it [Applause] [Music] back when the pervert of Vedanta has been made clear by Sharna mallanna by hearing and reasoning now on that clarity what needs to meditate you must settle your mind down on that this one pointed continuous meditation on what you have clarified is called needed Jocelin this is the meaning of the person let me just explain mother now is actually taking cogitating so let's say reason and a rough translation would be meditation but I guess what is sex what what do we expect to arise from Haryana enlightenment enlightenment the knowledge of the form I am Brahman that knowledge is supposed to arise so this is the basic idea but there are fine shades of meaning and lot of subtleties to be understood and gone into here so for example what what happens after showering when you hear the truth when you hear the teaching of Vedanta and then what is expected at this stage what is expected at this first stage is at the end of the first stage completion of the first stage you should know what we are not the same I should be able to say ok the first chapter of mythology says this I should be pretty pretty confident about it so the first part of Vedanta is known at the end of the first stage of this triple stages Sharaman animism Casa I should be able to see what the text says but then what is the problem the problem here will be then I'll go over the text phase but I don't understand it I do not get it yet I have doubts this doesn't seem possible it say that I am wrong and it says that I am NOT the body not the mind I am something called infinite existence consciousness place so it doesn't it's not very clear it's I don't see how it is possible so the obstacle at this stages but after sharanam after the first stage is completed I know what the book says but I do not get it so and that stage starts the second stage so here the question was what is the teaching if there are other English let me see you're gonna read yes sir yes No what is the teaching that's the question here so and that is answered by the first stage the second and just like writing pierogies the second stage the problem is I don't get it so here the Beamer process will be what what is him down what's your problem askin a which part of it do you not get ask your questions whatever questions come to you there are no silly questions here whatever is variable you find it difficult accent our reason it out for yourself or give it time it will become clear repeat the teaching sometimes repeating repeating the teaching is whatever works wonderfully what we studied in the last three days four days if you go back and repeat it you will see a lot of things becoming clearer and and many more questions coming up so at this stage what's your reason to it the result will be here the result is I know the text the result will be I give it I understand the teaching or I am convinced here maybe the problem was I am not converted yet means I'm not convinced and by the way not in which to go through that it's a process of listening I am released now usually in Vedantic texts the second stage of mononym literally means reasoning has been has been described as reasoning you ask questions you have doubts and the teacher helps you out work your way out to the doubts through and clears of your confusions or supplies what is missing and so you get clarity and hopefully after some time conviction and yes this is the truth I get it now I'm clear about it but here also there is a interesting point to be noted usually it's presented in this way but Shankar Acharya in his commentary on the brings our linear combination where these three stages are described with different names Shama nominal is it just like hearing reasoning and meditation are given different names in stages but the words the names used are different in that opposition the names are very interesting the names are fondant a volume modem the first first word means scholarship funding to mean scholarship surf matches funding typically means the quality of being a pundit scholarship you learn that knowledge so it's you can understand by Shravana map and idiom would be the same the second name is valium and come to that later on the third one girls for corresponding to meditation is moan on silence that's also understandable so the first one is vindictive meaning scholarship or study okay matches Sharada and publican the second one is the interesting one the word used is valium the word body of these with this apartment we should yeah the second word used in the plural recognition corresponding to Madonna valium in Sanskrit the word valium can have two meanings one meaning the straightforward meaning which people are automatically take is China like nature if Indian language is Borowitz child value means the nature of a child but Shankar Acharya commits this is not what is meant the word bond here in the second stage means something isn't entirely and the second meaning of valium in Sanskrit is strength strength strength how does it mean strength I'll gift for those who are interested in Sanskrit derivation ban Liam can be derived in two ways balus your Hara volume the nature of a child is volume or velocity of our volume thus in the niche the nature of having strength being strong that's also volume and Shankar Acharya says it's the second meaning which applies here how does it apply here and his take on this second stage is very instructive it's it's really very deep what he says is what do you have studied in the first stage you reason it out you begin to get clarity but at the same time in the second stage at the same time what you have to do is try to live it try to live on the strength that comes from this conviction I am NOT the body am I able to behave in a way which suggests that I am NOT the body I am NOT the mind I'm unable to be able to handle my mind in the way that it suggests that yes it's an object to be handled am I able to overcome petty irritations jealousy's upsets can i transcend that can I really put that distance between me and my body mind internally in my day-to-day life it should be reflected in life and it won't be easy because you're not yet enlightened you're in the middle of the of the process and he says this very process will entail a struggle it'll end in a study because you still feel somehow that I am the body-mind but now your intellect with the injection of banana tells you that you are not the body mind and you trying to struggle it's a very philosophical struggle you're trying to live up to that when you try to live up to that he says what'll happen is then he will truly get conviction that conviction comes not so much he seems to imply there a conviction comes not so much from intellectual philosophizing as from a struggle to live this philosophy as you struggle to live this philosophy as you fail 100 times and succeed on the hundred and first time you begin to understand it more you really really begin to understand it them more than sitting in a class and listening to philosophy charts see what happens when you listen to philosophy talks is sophisticated logical doubts like the one raised here can be raised and can be recent apart and can be settled it won't make the slightest difference to your life but if you try in a little bit I am NOT the body I am not the mind the body demands my tongue demands that I take that extra cookie but I have diabetes and I know that I should not take sugar it's a tendency in my mind which is arising it's an object I can see it as an object let me step back from it and disown it and I let go of that desire that I victory you did not take a second cookie but that applies every there let me do not lose my temper having lost my temper let me against apologize and step back from that it took ominous why because it's not me it's the mind it's not me it's the body it's not means the tongue it's the eyes it's the years these are tendencies set in motion years ago and because of that I am I have become a slave to my senses into my mind and to my past conditioning can I step back from my past condition our most precious ideas especially gallium is a very attached to their ideas they live in the red normally those on the path of knowledge they tend to be monastic by nature even if they are not formally bugs internally they are monk like most people on the path of knowledge so they tend to be simple and austere people not too much engaged in well in the worldliness they give up worldly pursuits and honor it happens but they are very attached to their ideas challenge non-dualism and get your inner horizont are whatever whatever their pet idea but then they are also realized that this idea is also a movement in the mind when I am in deep sleep where are my the various my philosophy my dwellest or a non duelist I'm an atheist or at least nothing they are just movements in the mind stuff in the lake of the mind ripples on the mind island none of them if this is so can you live up to it not only in deep sleep but in making so this struggle it leads to clarity and fiction swami prabhavananda the founder of the Vedanta Society of Southern California he writes that when he was a young monk in Banaras Swami Turia and the disciple of sri ramakrishna hurry manners he was a very senior monk and and he was ill he was sort of in the hospital they're living in there now from Amonte right knowing that such a great we don t like saw Victoria I was living there I thought this is my opportunity to learn Gita from such a great villain imagine learning bhagavad-gita was for Victoria so he went and asked song Ithorian will you teach me the kita and three energy said yes come tomorrow only in the morning you have to book and come tomorrow so you see so overjoyed next morning event with the book and given to him and about town and he began his the first listen he says take up one verse read it thoroughly understand it memorize it think about it meditate over it live it for a week and then take up the next verse this is my first and last lesson in the country what does he mean he means this valley on this second stage it's not just the point is it's not just intellectual it's a struggle not into the intellectual level is to struggle at the whole physical mental emotional and intellectual them to make these things real as you do it will you be enlightened not necessarily but you will get clarity you will really begin to understand what is meant by saying and not the body you really begin to understand what's meant by saying what all it entails to say I am NOT the mind what a tremendous statement to make we are not saying that the mind is not there the mind is there the body is there and it appears to you at least it will not disappear but I am NOT it no more than I am the shirt that I am maybe so that is the second stage now at the end of the second stage what will happen clarity will come you will say I get it I get it with every fiber of my being I am I am getting it exclaimed to me now but still it what remains what's the problem here why see all these why is meditation what is the problem contrary tendencies this is the car what company tendencies I understand all of that but really doesn't seem to help me in my day-to-day life I still am miserable I still feel hurt I still feel anxious I still feel nervous maybe the fear of death still sort of haunts me don't know intellectually I begin to and me is pretty clear to me now although you know something if you follow what Shankar Acharya sent rigorously for some time even this problem will begin to go if you start trying to live it it's only when you keep the second stage as a purely intellectual state that this problem remains contrary attendance anyway contrary tendencies is the problem I think I are the admin I sort of see it's true but still I behave in the world as if an body - I do not feel enlightened enlightened and do not feel that our moksha that's my problem that's the third stage then they say they say that you have to meditate meditate on what you understand the Encarta teaching you have been raised about the teaching what you have God in what you that's what it said that meaning which our clarity about by be by these beats by China and my mother meant by need what you've got pallet in conviction about please meditate focus your mind bear down on it fiercely for a sustained period of time and then what happens this is real you can truthfully clean I am don't run out cleaning it but you want a 90% boy enlightenment is there one technical point those were finicky about their aunt wait away the non-dual Vedanta will we would want me to point it out what produces the final enlightenment here it seems the meditation produces it right here you know the teaching here you convinced about it and here you become enlightened it seems like that one school of Veda accounted poverty school there are different schools of another a few different schools of it are very good they say meditation produces enlargements first you must learn it then he was recent about college and what you have learned in recent department which now meditate upon it and we legalized it but there is another school we understand it says now this first hearing studying banana hearing the truth produces enlightenment then what about reasoning is meditation reasoning and meditation remove obstructions to to enlightenment reasoning and meditation remove obstructions to enlightenment what are the obstructions you've already got the knowledge here when you read it when you will you understand what is being taught you've already cut it now your obstruction is the mind says it's impossible there are technical words for this it's called are some harmonic impossibility obstruction you mind says it's impossible I can't be proud man and this is so that obstruction has to be removed by forever then the second obstruction comes it is contrary tendencies in sanskrit we parry the power i still behave as if either a body money and that is to be removed by meditation so ami Vivekananda says tell yourself again and again so um I am that and that reality again and again till it tingles with every drop of your blood so that's not hypnotizing yourself you have understood it you're convinced about it now you are driving it deep into yourself because why do you have to do that driving deep into yourself because the opposite thing has been driven deep into us then I am a body mind that has to be corrected so the winner under school these are schools Okayama schools are available the worlds with both of them a model thousand years old so the real owners will say teaching gives enlightenment gives knowledge and this removes obstructions the second stage removes a particular obstruction which is impossibility it's impossible and that problem is removed and the third one removes the next obstruction which is contrary tendencies continuing to behave as if a religious body might inhibit those that will remove and the original learning knowledge will shine forth and you would say I am enlightened but the Enlightenment technically is not being produced by these two why do they insist on it it's a minor point at worth noting knowledge is produced by brahmana brahmana its source of knowledge and in Vedanta the pramana the source of knowledge is Upanishads what tells you that your brahma baby you know that you're running from definitions when the Guru tells you you are rather than that thou art that's the source of knowledge not thinking neither meditation meditation does not give rise to knowledge it removes an obstacle thinking does not give rise to knowledge it gives you clarity about what you already learned the example they give is this old story of the ten persons change friends who cross the river and then when they cross the river the French stuff had the old cross stories did somebody jump let's count and they counted one of the counting one two three four five six seven eight nine oh my god the ten persons drum others and you don't ruin you try to let me do it one two three four five six and now you know right at our friend is drowned so we are really naive you attended only night and they started crying and another person who walks by says why are you crying my friends you know the whole story and they said we were ten when we started what we cross the river and our friend drowned how do you know your friend out drown the 10th person was drowned what do you know will be counted they're only nine of the small and this man must have seen there ten of them so you realize what mistake you're making and he said okay count I am assuring you the tenth person is there the guru consensus the text tells you you are running don't worry I'll show you how we already counted so just humor me count again and so they count one two three four five six seven eight nine in total light and this man says comes up to the person who's counting holds him by the hand and turns the hand towards him and says thou art the tenth - I must promise II thou art the ten he realizes oh I am the tenth just a minute let me see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten yes the tenth person has been found and they all say that let me try let me try and each of them comes up and tries once or twice yes it works the tenth person has been found and is so happy now the question declared that story can be used in different ways and it has been used to be nothing but here I'm using within a particular sense to prove that waiver under schools point of view this enlightenment that the tenth person the person got a counter that I am the tenth person how did he get it did he get it by Counting no because he was configured here on earth did he get in by the meditation no he got it from the words of the wise man the wise man communicated to him thou are the tenth now the opposition the Guru communicates to you that the heart thou are the tenth you are that and you realize I am brother so that communication happened there and at the level of shaman on the first stage the other to be necessary because we have problems and doubts those are cleared up by the second please secondary practices so the river under school claims the source of knowledge did we not say that the source of knowledge is who Venetian Ratna wat Samantha wad was heard here so here is the source of knowledge not here nothing that's their country the novelty point of view is come on let's be practical you may have heard so many takes in thirty years where ten be made out the classes not invited it's only when you do reasoning about it get clarification and deeply really try and meditate that once a flash is the fun so let's say meditation produces this present any two different views yes sir seven effort from grace would put you may sharpen the question in this context okay all right means there are two all right let me when you put it in a logical form how can you get infinite result with a finite effort if you say that all right then I can deal with the answer the result the thing is by this what happens you generate the knowledge I am Brandon and what does it do it removes ignorance okay it's a leak lyrica it generates a result I am Brandon you get them in line in a flash of enlightenment and by that what is dispelled the ignorance and its effects that I am the body-mind that's the disparate and you realize your problem now what is infinite in this what is infinite there is only one thing infinite in Android of Atlanta from there's only one thing infinite you later without the Brandon not the knowledge flash of knowledge comes and goes there's the knowledge growing yes and no Sri Ramakrishna's classic example of the two thirds if you have the power of ignorant sin your flesh you take the third of knowledge and pick up the sword of ignorance and think what you do throw away the throne of ignorance and keep the throne of knowledge in your flesh no it's your birthday what does it mean because in our general way of understanding gaining knowledge and losing knowledge if you lose knowledge and you don't have knowledge anymore that's what we think so when you hear that knowledge came and then it can also enter it yourself sneaking you feel that so I'm back to where I was no that's not true in this case you're not back to anywhere you are back to what you really we're from a home of ignorance is dispelled by an equally false knowledge false knowledge does not mean that you are not pregnant be careful you are wrong but this knowledge is produced where in the mind which is an effect of fire is this knowledge within Maya outside life with in mind all it does is dispelled ignorance which is mine at that level it works at that levels it works at the level of mine all the mean is knowledge to dispel ignorance neither is ignorance Brahman or is not a problem rather than a problem so that infinity would only infinity here is problem which always was there it was not produced by this effort Brahman is not produced by the Zephyr now you might ask particularly quick student would would ask ok brother is not produced by the separate but moksha freedom freedom is produced by the separate and that freedom you can ask is it eternal or is it temporary is it infinite or it is a finite and everybody has to say that you know moksha del mana or enlightenment this has to be turned nobody wants a temporary motion so you get moksha by this liberation and that liberation by your own a rock it has to be eternal being when one sets infinite so isn't infinite or produce prices do you understand the question now let me repeat the question his question is is this a logical problem here all this seems to be centreford and every self-effort is a limited effort and the present which is producing seems to be infinite how can you get infinite results from a limited effort how can a limited quantity produce any infinite quantity that's the question all right now I answered that the limited result that I am Brahman I mean the limited effort it produced a limited present that flash of enlightenment a time brother the only infinite thing here is brother which is infinite in which already was it was not produced by a record only your ignorance was removed but a secondary question could be isn't moksha produced by our effort liberation and that liberation is finite or infinite if it's finite it is limited and you will lose it again nobody nobody wants a liberation or a dative Allah or a salvation is limited it is infinite so again we are back to the same problem the limited amount of effort produce an unlimited infinite result called moksha film that where the beautiful concept [Music] it's not clear don't repeat that words we did the Sara consent that means constant practice called subtract these comes in practice so but even constant practice done over a thousand items is not infinite efforts okay still a finite effort right logically speaking now let me talk about something else let me give you the answer and then let me see the question and the answer made any sense at all the question is limited effort here it seems to produce an infinite result what is the limit and effort Sharaman an uneasiness on including nativity answer is limited effort no matter how great the spiritual secret you are how many lights you've been trying still the total will be limited can't be infinite and the result seems to be infinite what is relative present here moksha freedom forever so did limited effort produce and an unlimited result yes it cannot Brahman is infinite all right but everyone was not produced by this yes fine but the attainment itself moksha freedom is it infinite or not but I knew you wasn't it produced by knowledge we already can be answered here it's the answer is is simple here there isn't there is actually a deep misconception about moksha our miss capacity which conception about said there's a preliminary idea what moksha and there is a mature idea what emotion the preliminary idea what moksha is I am bothered I have been going through life after life and I seek liberation I seek enlightenment moksha they'll want a salvation something and then finally after a lot of vedanta retreats and plenty of meditation I finally get enlightenment and that leads to moksha so all my births and rivers they cease and from now on forever I am free I have got moksha in this last part is important from now on from the point of liberation from the point of enlightenment onwards and free this will be my last birth so that's the story we have heard let's the stir in the effort that's good internal but now that you are a bunch of the she we need to move on to a deeper understanding of moksha what will happen not to live after enlightenment you know what you will feel like is not that I was bound now I'm free forever no you will realize I was free forever I am free and I had always remain free moksha and brotherman aren't the same thing moksha the very nature of moksha is Brahman the very nature of Brahman is moksha moksha is infinite truth but moksha was not produced by enlightenment the knowledge that I'm from and the knowledge that I'm Brandon removed the ignorance that I am not run and allow me to see that I'm always I always have moksha I'm always free if you remove the ignorance that are not free which is magnet so that assaults your problem it does not produce an infinite result it just removes as finite ignorant what ignorant are not remand that was removed I am drunk I'm not free I am free not now onwards I always watch that will be the feeling and when you get enlightened you know often of the people those who wake up death experiences it was there all along how did I never see it and that's true for all of us all of us supalen but the point of our enlightenment with say oh it was there right there in loon lake I didn't see it so a finite effort does not produce an infinite result logic is preserved relations will be happy but now let's go to a deeper question which you asked the question of self effort and grace all this seems to be self-important but if you look at the lives of great spiritual seekers they would say it's all grace even this is grace even what we are doing here is grace and it's not that I am saying it emotionally the most radical text of non-dualism our duty kita the first verse of it is Ishwara graha they were boom solid plate of asana the first opening theme is I think maybe that's the only time God is mentioned in the whole book but begins with it is by each Juarez place remember who is Ishwara same random class model it is by the grace of God that you have a liking that tendency towards numb to realism this tendency towards non-dualism is the special grace of God because it leads directly to liberation to option so it is Grace even this tendency is Grace the desire to come and learn Vedanta the desire to seek liberation that is grace the grace works in that way yes yes you are rather it comes from ish one brahmand initial are not quite the same when you think that you are a seeker when you think you are a seeker trying to get liberation trying to learn Vedanta are you seeking as Brahman why would pregnancy problem you are seeking as a Jeeva at that point then that brown one is issue enough for you Godfrey so much let's let's take it one by the lipstick it one by one yeah no deep within me a clinging that will be very careful who is the me is it brown or is it the Jeeva yes which is truly primal true no doubt about it but as you operators the Jeeva that same brand man appears to you as issue Allah and at this level we are all dependent on the grace of God this desire for enlightenment beyond G vanish for a beyond human and God not to the absolute existence consciousness bliss this movement this is the special grace of God otherwise what will happen is you keep getting into these tangles don't mix up the aromatic and varaha Rica the relative rate a realm of where we are dreading and the absolute the absolute is only the absolute even the question does grace come from Brahma Nadi is a mixing of of two levels the moment you say brother there's no me there's no world there is no God it's only one natural reality all right I come to you yeah you gotta question already we'll come back to you was that forget it one so my question I don't mean to throw a red herring into this but I'm just again but maybe just asking for more clarification that you said issuer is is that's where the grace is coming from is that grace personified in your guru yes because you have to have faith or bhakti to not contradict the pramana otherwise if you don't have that basic you nodding will keep yourself away from knowledge because of the obstacles which could be named anything but you may not also have the blessings or the grace that you talked about to do move forward what is the question I'm not sure the questions but the question is in there somewhere yes yes so the Guru is the manifestation of the grace of God it is true the Guru Shakti is called a nucleoside Shakti the power of grace because through the Guru spiritual knowledge comes true the greater the grace of God and the grace of Guru is about it anyway let's get back to the point of meditation we're talking about meditation the role of meditation just the technical difference now moving on to another point needed the arson of meditation these are to false it can be in two ways if another the distinction between yogic meditation and pedantic meditation has to be understood yogic meditation is concentration yogic meditation is concentration when you sit down calm the movements of the body calm the BRIT then withdraw from the world outside calm the senses and then focus the mind mind wavers bring it back again and again until it is steady and then observed I've just named the stages of yoga asana steadiness sit actually say physically sit coming the bottom then pranayama calming the breath the breath is connected with the mind then practice withdrawing from the world the senses from the world calming the senses the clamor of the senses must be calmed then focusing the mind karana again and again bringing the mind to one point it could Oh or Krishna or Ramu something some spiritual symbol or Avenger thought and then that mind becomes steady you have to bring it back again and again then it becomes steady that steadiness is called TR meditation and that steadiness leads to absorption the absorption and forgetfulness of the world even of the body that is called Samadhi so what did we have of course the preliminary steps are there yama yama moral prerequisites but then the third step is asked in a city pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana samadhi moral prerequisites sitting controller press withdrawal of the senses from the from their objects bringing the mind back and again and again into a focus and then the continuous flow of the mind towards its object of meditation and then absorption some ugly - Patanjali oh it's a very clear systematic way of training and focusing the mind now redonda accepts this only the philosophy behind it is not accepted we are not trying to separate practically in pure shock we are trying to seal that BR existence consciousness place and all of this manifestation is within existence consciousness bliss one non dual Brahman I am the conclusion that we have got on stage one and stage two that conclusion you will meditate upon this is accepted this entire process is accepted by the Masters of non-dual vedanta they have no objections to the technology the methodology of Patanjali yoga if you want to meditate no better manual of exists that button passenger yoga it's the grand melody of our meditation schools even its story it's the oldest text on meditation there are references to meditation in the operation saga but a full manual detailed manual of meditation we don't find anything before that yes there are all derived from this there are there are varieties people may object the Buddhist mindfulness techniques a different from Patanjali meditation but I don't see the roots are there why do I see the roots are there if you look at the Buddha before he became the Buddha when he was searching he went into number of teachers and the most well-known teachers at that time with Dollarama bathtub and then one was one more was at least two we know there are ascetics and Hermits and they taught and if you listen to the buddha's own words what did he learn from them which you find about the scriptures clearly it is some form of pattern of Santa and Patanjali yoga some kind of proto Patanjali yoga may be around the same time even potentially could be the same time a little later after Buddha but those techniques predated presently and they were they were being taught freely by many many teachers all over India so in Buddhist meditation techniques also you find the same DNA but it morphed and changed so yes there are new and innovative ways of meditation in Buddhism which are not there potentially but the roots are there in potentially yoga now my point is advaitha vasanta accepts this advaitha has nothing against you sitting and patrolling your breath and meditating what you will meditate upon the matter is given by this teaching what you have done Travon and Madonna meditate on that not only is advaitha not against it but 20 is very much for it it should try it that's one form of needed cancer one form of needed cancer when you sit actually sit if you want to do a little bit of bread culture do that and then you withdraw your my few sentences from the clamour of the world and then you focus on what you have studied and meditate that's one form we can try it a little bit let me mention the other form which is unique which is different from patent review aware without the differs from facility over the other from a form of meditation would be you are not required to sit and meditate it could be in the midst of any activity most activities not any most activities whatsoever what they need is straight away that it means is that in the midst of our daily business of life keep the Vedic knowledge as the flat bone it has as your support hold on to that when you are working when you are talking when you are whatever you're doing change the paradigm what's going on here am i a body and mind this individual eating food or is it Brahman in the name and form of this body and mind eating is another an action actually it is Brahman with the name and form of eating and food it is actually brother than with the name and form of food and pouring brundin into Brahman when swami brahma holland the passed away last day last few minutes of his life is like dog and he has a vision of krishna because he was supposed to be the Playmate of krishna and he says my Krishna has come put anklets on my feet I shall dance with him he's dying and then somebody says his throat is dried up so that it says Swami should I put a little lemonade in your mouth he says lemonade yes put Brahman in Brahman poor Brahmin into Brahma so he actually sees that all these varieties now in the midst of all the actions if you can keep your mind on this idea in this understanding it is brandman in all these forms sure but that would be more like Patanjali over you are focusing her mind on the one we're not the wood but here I mean if you introduce that if you if you're asking is that a good spiritual practice I'd say yes if you guys is that what you are saying here I'm not sure I couldn't even make out what you're saying studies you're trying to know what was the last sentence you said I didn't get that conceived to be partially mental process focuses more complex of focusing on a point and if one habitually is used to mantra and now you have all the head without a patient that's different I mean on that saying this way right or wrong I'm just saying where does the mantra all right let's bracket that question and keep it aside for the time being let me finish what I'm doing Vedanta meditation at least let me just point out what it is right I'm trying to point out what it is is one aspect of your concern it does not seem to be one point it it seems to be a mental or intellectual process this pedantic meditation know what the intellectual process has been completed in the first two stages now you have a pretty good clarity about what you really are what with active meditation is telling you stay there stay there don't think don't intellectualize stay there in the undoubted self which you have found me on the five sheets don't get mixed up with the five sheets again anything that is the approach it it has not so again my McLean stay there that will be the metabiotic meditation and that's what you are seeing everywhere in the world with open eyes also if you try to do but Anjali Yoga with open eyes but Anjali will be very annoying you're supposed to close your eyes sit in meditation and close your eyes don't move around and then focus because the body has to be still the breath has to be quiet and the senses have to be withdrawn then only is Patanjali Yoga possible it's a very clear process it's called Ashtanga Yoga Patanjali yoga but we're not like meditation involves meditation with eyes open also if the knowledge is at all true then what you are looking at with eyes open is it not wrong [Music] right a lot of interviews run right but just understand what they are trying to say then you work backwards and you can synthesize but I agree with you it the contemplation is the right word you see originally what we call meditation today was called contemplation in the Christian tradition meditation is not a Sanskrit word contemplation start Sanskrit word technically correct word for all of this would be contemplation but it went out of use govern use maybe a generation of several generations ago so now what was originally contemplation is nowadays called meditation but earlier in Christian theology meditation meant thinking and what we call meditation today actually was called contemplation contemplative prayer at that time yeah but anyway back to this father Keating Thomas Keating yes if it talks about centering prayer now we're talking about meditation which is open what you see is Brahman every action that you perform is Brahman so it should be possible to meditate while experiencing the world in potentially over meditation is not possible while experiencing the world you must stop experiencing the world you must step away from poverty otherwise you cannot meditate the very sutras rictus are not permitted under the mu if you have other with these coming up in the mind the meditation is not possible all those with these modifications of the mind must be settled into one pointedness and then beyond that that's Patanjali yoga but adwaita says whatever Ricky comes into your mind after all it is brahman the lake without waves the lake delay with lots of bells is still the lake it's a knowledge-based approach now notice something when we go out there and chant Rama Rama Rama Hari it's not it's it's a mantra which Chili's non-dualistic you cannot interpret it from a Patanjali yoga or Sankhya point of view it's not a prayer to make you hungry Brahma hardened from Navajo Ramona what does it mean if you if you actually look at it what it means is the prototype of religious rituals in ancient India was the fire sacrifice where a fire was lit and priests way the police would come and they would take this wooden ladle scored at Pune and they would take the offerings butter and stuff and pour it into the file to that company meant of chanting of mantras so now that was the basic system now this this verse refers to that it says the ladle with which you are pouring the key that the offering that later the wooden ladle that's not a little it's not a spoon it's Brahman the fire into it you're falling that's not fire its brother the offering which you poured into the fire that's not nothing yes brother the priest who is pouring between this action it's not a priest it's brother and the one who makes a habit of seeing rambling in all actions in this way will attain to Brahma Brahma he within 1/10 of them you will he alone will attain to Brandon who sees Brahma Carlos a body whose absorbance umbrella in all elections you know yeah that's the central yes in bhagavad-gita that's from the bhagavad-gita for Jackie now you cannot do that in potentially yoga you have to cease action and then sit in meditation because meditation is a particular action you cannot combine it with other things this you can combine with all actions because this brahma param maha with this attitude it's an attitude it's a knowledge it's not an action as such it's a paradigm which new paladin which enables you to see the same actions as brother if you see Chicano say this committee I just quoted from Shankara check is coming right now explaining that that verse Rama product that ladle is Brahman what does it mean he says clearly it's not a little it's Brahman fire is from and what does it mean really it's not higher it's Brahmins this relation is anti connotation with eyes open in the midst of our daily business of living seeing branded in everything and in each thing and everything in every action in every person in every in every event of your life yes yes all right now let me say something about that in relation to his question and your question also many of us here most of us maybe we have been initiated with a mantra first ceteris paribus not simplified what what's that that one Latin phrase by a baby Karianna emptor carry and enter ceteris paribus means all of those things have been using but by a me we're all those who have bought into the this attractive thing which we were doing the way array beware of what do not mix two things together this is that one level the mantra that you have been initiated into by the Guru and the technique that has been given by the Guru is that an entirely different level altogether do not fiddle with it I attended this nice retreat unarmed well without a bunch of the Sheep wow that's great let me upgrade let me have her from iPhone 6 - I was in monitor 6 - y 1 through 7 disaster let me let me add the knowledge are not in the pancetta G class - my mantra practice no no no no absolutely not never do such a thing if it automatically your point of view changes because of this if you take it seriously and it changes it will affect your practice but that's a natural way but don't redesign your practice in the light of what you have learned not that practice is sacrosanct in in computer languages you've built a firewall around it that is the mantra is the mystic this is plausible but let me finish let me finish it so this is first point I want to add here that don't mix the two don't fiddle bit with your bunch of practice and as the Guru has said carry on that one as we have been carrying until now from now on also you carry on that way don't mix it up this will have its effect this will have its effect at other times you can think about it read about it philosophize about it struggle with it leave it try to see it in your daily activities you get tired of it slip back into your mantra practice doing the month not get tired of that do web advisor so aren't you doing two things we reckoned it might recommend it to an American disciple American lady here in America he said when I am feeling good I say I am deokman such as out of the Brahman I am Shiva and when I have a tummy ache I say mothers so I'm sure that lady must have glass-like do you drink now he turned towards her and said madam always keep two sides always keep two sides you see is this the truth I'm convinced it is and is God the divine mother devotion is it the truth I'm convinced it is yes so why will you do you feel that you have to sacrifice this for that of that purchased without the least hesitation just like Vivekananda or Ramakrishna or Tori Ananda go directly from non-dual Vedanta I am Brahman to to Ma the child you are my mother you see I'll tell you something which is not said in the book all of these are human attempts at grasping the infinite even this I tell the countess has been highest I mean by this I mean Advaita Vedanta not do it without the highest the best attempt that human beings have ever made from the beginning of civilization till today I can have anything better in all my searches but still I will tell this to you opening at the end of Pathology class this is still a human attempt it's an approximation the truth is beyond philosophy the truth is beyond different practices and rituals in fact the greatest of non twists shankara's gurus guru go to bother whoo lordy Manduca chronica may be the highest text of knowledge well Vedanta how about keeping that for the retreat next time Monica come on dopey punish just I can teach the whole thing in three days but and a sense of that so in the Manduca Kanaka avocado seeds imagine radical novelist and what does he say it's something like this joint and which aunty advaitha with chanting a channel do intermittent teach our bodies do it ah great I forget the whole Kolkata verse some love knowledge realism others prefer dualism the truth is entirely beyond dualism and non-dualism these are the radical language he says that complete surrender Brahman is the only reality and in practical day-to-day life what does that mean complete surrender to the divine mother yes look at the non-dualistic greatest mountain is like ramana maharshi notice the lived in complete surrender to God the day-to-day life it is trying along and strut around saying I am Donnellan never life was one of complete serenity okay is there any point that had left two types of meditation and vedanta the vomit issue with eyes open oh I will be complete what I was saying to him it's important I mean only one point about the mantra so far that you should not meddle with it it's one point the second point is it is the same truth this and the mantra expressed the same truth how sri ramakrishna said an offender this one he also said I'll tell you in Bengali and then translate it's important for people who have got initiation to notice otherwise there will be conflict what he's expressing the project will come we said JJ Aristo sheitel Atma the Artman existence consciousness bliss and the chosen idea is given to you by your guru and name mantra and the form whoever is your chosen ideal that is exactly your self existence consciousness please I'll repeat the exact Bengali and English j-josh Toshi Tariq ah whoever is the chosen ideal for you or for anybody that one is that person's Atman that chosen ideal is the other if you choose not to walk on this path and you choose to meditate and love and adore the chosen idea and repeat the mantra that's enough you doing exactly the same thing you are approaching it by the way of their heart this is approaching the same thing by the way of the intellect my recommendation is do both but it's the same thing I remember I asked open marks from Indian mythology he was a disciple of swami sivananda when I asked him he was just above a hundred years old sitting in in below mud even to one hundred four hundred three ethic disciple of maroush Manoj so I miss Yvonne hunter I'll tell you the whole story I think that's lasting until now so I've heard I got Tyne Swamy running on and there was president of the order and this cooping moneth disciple of swami shivananda raghunatha and the disciple of swami sivananda this open barrage used to go once in a while to swami Ranganathan and DG and one day he asked after bowing down to swami rama the president of the order he asked barrage swami what will happen to me just a question no context and Swami Rama returned ji immediately replied this is your last life I shall come again but you don't have to come again this is your last life he said it in English all three life sentences he said he'll come agree to do so he did work rather it chose to company but he said you don't have to come here this is your last life so I sometime after saw the Nagaraju passed away I wanted to verify this you know hot stories gatherer yes they get together they get embellished and together flourish as time goes by so I wanted to get the exact thing so one day I saw whooping car sitting in holy Moses temple by the side of the Ganges River around this time little earlier by Watanabe and so I went up to him I got down to him and I said sorry about to ask you some time back so I mean I'm gonna tell them did you went to Swami Langerhans and Jimmy asked what will happen to me and he said before I could say anything further the Swami completed it he said yes mara X told me not gonna come she told me this is your last life I shall come any winning evil coming in but you don't have to come again this is your last life three sentences exactly as I heard now I was excited by it of course this means you're going to get moksha liberation in this life itself so but to my circuit the caliber of the Swami he is not overexcited rather he is inspired by Swami Ranganathan energies attitude he said look at his attitude he wants to come and do Swami's his work again after some time a little bit of that I was getting impatient so I throw the Swami but Swami then that keep that aside but you have got as I used the word to team minerally if it means a vacation upon application you're free on this world moksha and he lands he was so relaxed he said let's see the blessings of the maha purusha maha purusha means swami sivananda let us see the blessings of he's so relaxed about it he's not particularly then I asked him this question cuz I always spend that he was an invention person one of the few really in that in person said Mike so I asked this question the mantra we have got and the eastern a Viterbi have got from our guru the chosen ideal and the Vedanta that we are reading and teaching what's the connection between the two and he said have you not heard what's ulama Krishna is to say Swami a candle and they say because this morning also serves saw me a condiment at one time what Swami - and also said he who is your chosen ideal is your Hartman let me say do you think it's only here it's here and there and everywhere he chose an idea and then I asked him because I wanted to know what does an enlightened person how does an enlightened person experience the world he was sitting there they simply if you're gone to believe what you'll see on one side of the volume understand fill on that side is Swami Vivekananda standing so you were sitting on volume understand book and facing so I am accustomed to their activities are walking on the lawn near the river at that time so I asked him so I mean how does an enlightened person see the world I'm not I'm not talking about meditation I think just like that right now what's the difference between an enlightened person me so my question was how does an enlightened person see the world is it that here are all the names and pumps that's all my book learning coming to the fore here are all the names and falls and behind it somehow in the background is this existence consciousness bliss is this like a shadow or that name at home and then he said immediately said why so it is all one no no come candle it is all one it's one reality you see what's colored my mind is all this you have to distinguish between name and five object and consciousness consciousness and object but ultimately what conscious what do we connect back to that it is one consciousness in which all these appearances are there and be the appearances and appearances of that consciousness it's Bronwyn and running alone he did not explain in so many words he just said why so it's all one and then I pushed it a little too far I asked him I was asked him so is that how more experience in the world right now and he answered with the story he said slowly jagadananda who's a disciple of holy mother who was the first translator of the crepeiness on which it analogous translated it again the first class little bit of the great master and he's also the one that many stories about him why he was living he was widely known to be an invited person even look at them very spiritually advanced person and one more story I'll tell you about him when holy witness it's well known in the life of the holy mother and she came to visit Balu mud in the early days of Balu but she was taken around and shown the different things going on and she saw the monks and novices and novices plastic novices dressing vegetables cutting the vegetables and herbs and she said in a simple way that Bob keeshan dog chili la Cucaracha how nicely the boys are dressing vegetables doing it so nicely that young boys but young men but did this work so nicely and among who was at her side showing her alone he immediately commented whether by meditation and prayer or by cutting vegetables the aim is to please the divine mother she was pleasing immediately pointed out but ideas is to please you that's the point of the whole spiritual practices she didn't say anything she kept right the man who pointed it out Islamic anyway the story that he told me Swami new book talent open Iman it was this Swami booth harem that was the head of Delhi Ramakrishna mission who was here in this country also for a while he wanted a ask so each other down on them well sir are you invited people say you are liberated by living Jeevan Mukta ethniki brahma can anyone enlightened person he straightaway eyes and it seems jagged our energy with parents is supposed to have a very sweet smile he smiled sweetly and was tolerance to she looked down inside smiled sweetly and he said if I say yes will you believe me immediately hand will it be such a little money if I say yes will you believe me I hate it you got the message that's why we were sitting there I folded my hands and said it's alright we just bless me I bowed down to it when I walked away yes so the point I was making the second point that the first point don't mess with your month of practice second point it is the same thing you needn't worry here is this great philosophy am i incorporating it nicely into my practice don't worry I talk about it at all if you are not no loss and if you want to it will happen automatically but don't pity with the mantra practice but the mantra go on yes any other questions couple of minutes we have yes question Sri Ramakrishna no because I'm losing the words [Music] yes Sri Ramakrishna seemed to be about the but but he was unrealistic all right then you know nicely absolutely right and that swami vivekananda himself said that the old man seemed to be a factor he was all Jana inside outside he was a devotee crying and singing and praying and saying mother mother and a child Vivekananda says and who would know better than me the canal he was all Gianna inside he was all knowledge inside Ramakrishna and I seem to be like a Johnny outside but inside I am a vodka he said I'm inside and very soft and I'm a lover of God and these are not the exact words but words to that effect true he said that what can we learn from that I take it that be many-sided don't be one-sided be a meditator when it takes seriously and deeply we are devoting cry and weep to the Lord it takes us refuge in the Lord and surrender to the Lord and love the Lord and Jesus said love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind you have to be a complete devotee like Chaitanya many did like potentially himself like living under the human it is better than mannequin and if you see the picture perfect what'd you find out about us and our sitting and everything everything is perfectly illustrated in very convincing and then it came naturally to him we are alike Shankara discriminates say I am NOT the body and mind clearly all these are appearances in the consciousness which I had as a matter of fact it's actually a fact right now and dedicate all of your life to the welfare of others what better life can't there be we become the same let all the vision sees that means let our dream scenes awaken we realize that you're wrong right now or if you cannot if you cannot it gives a little concession if you cannot eternal love and service free unconditional love and service to it history it origin cannot dream but better dreams which are returned and love and service you if you must go on dreaming then dream up attention then this nightmare your cotton unconditional love you have nothing to lose who will you why should you not love everybody and everything unconditionally because it is your beloved your brother and service free you don't want anything from life so let this body and might be used for the benefit of everybody what better life could there be okay that's in the lover of nature would you meditate because open a new book at one time you feel like been drawing meditate with your eyes closed and other times you feel like looking out meditate with your eyes open I met this names we have set me on I had this monk in the Himalayas who lived for 40 to 50 years at 10,000 feet in a little Hut he was not only learning his who was one of the greatest without the teachers of his time but this monk I met was not very learning and so when he went to this guru he said I wanted to find a senior that there is so he was sent to this group and this guru said what can you do here you don't understand Sanskrit you what are going to do it but this monkey said it was a kid at that time teenagers he said I told my guru I know I do not understand what you are teaching but let me just stay here and serve you and sit and listen just let me sit and listen and I'll serve him I'll take care of everything I'll clean the place so he stayed and he became a disciple and why am I saying is up the guru told him what is his practice all this fancy philosophy is difficult beyond him his practice Goodell noticed that she loved the Himalaya Himalaya Mountains he loved the Ganges in love nature so the Guru told him it's a quote from kavita's actually the code is very interesting : a bigamist ha ha ha I look upon my lord with open eyes not with closed eyes in meditation and prayer with open eyes I look upon the Lord you look upon you find the Lord he said find the Lord in this system in this magma gistic mountains and this holy river of ancient river of our civilization in all of this in the sky and the earth in the snow you find your Lord and he did it all is life he lived in the magnificence of he became a relevant mountain here after that sometime he guided these mountaineering parties of the high really high the real Giants navel is 22050 indeed beacon of the places so but his purpose was spiritual their purpose was mountaineering but his purpose he would go with these groups and he would challenge he would literally dance up the mountain peaks yes you can find God in nature there's a very beautiful way of ending this session I expect mark told me his guru told him from the Rig Veda of the most ancient of the Vedas about seeing God in nature there's this line it says but surely was Jakob Dylan Johanna Giratina mama oh man look upon the poetry of the Lord which neither decay is nor ties what is the poetry of the Lord universe contemplate the poetry of the poem of the poetry of the Lord which neither the kings not eyes I asked where is it from any part it was in the Rig Veda the most ancient of the Vedas for sure Davis sir Guardian very simple Sanskrit unity really namaha boom John DeSean the Chandi Hadassah Sri Ramakrishna you
