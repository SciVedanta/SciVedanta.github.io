[Panchadasi - Lecture 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3eABsDNQmA)

Oh [Music] haha dude Britannia Oh Shaun - Shaun vishanti home leaders from the unreal - the real leaders from darkness into light leaders from death to immortality [Music] this journey from the unreal to the real how do you do that leaders from the unreal to the real so can you walk across can you take that little platform across from the real to the Andrea is it as your be in space across space from the realtor done real not real world who are real heaven or something somewhere else here and there no these are simple things but it's important to know it's important to know what we are seeking in spiritual life motion did want a Salvation whatever you call it enlightenment is here wherever you go it is there is it a journey means in time now it's unreal and then later on after death or after Samadhi or after something else it will become real after enlightenment it will become real now you don't seem so sure you know it's not a journey in time either yeah it's not only here it's now it's always present it by it I need the real from the Unreal to the real is it one thing drop from one thing to another from a worldly life to irreverently life or from a secular life to quote unquote a spiritual life is it that so it's not a journey in space it's not a journey in time it's not a bit short not a journey from one thing to another actually it makes it's more precise in Sanskrit they shock Allah was - deja means space kala means time was - means object things none of these are pertinent to the journey from the Unreal to the ring leaders from the idea to the real and what is this journey how correct travel it's a journey from ignorance to knowledge but what are we leaders from what - what will ignorant still knowledge that's what the prayer is for we do not know we do not realize it with to know it we have to realize it that's what's called enlightenment so the journey from the Unreal to the real is not across space it's not across time it's not from one thing to another but rather it is a journey in knowledge from ignorance to knowledge from not knowing to knowing from being asleep to waking up the story of the Buddha with Annalee awakened not a man becoming a god no it's from being asleep waking up leaders from darkness into light again it's a journey from ignorance to knowledge from darkness to light ignore to knowledge from death to immortality there are always nice stories in in the Indian mythology on the Amrita the nectar which the gods and the demons and they all saw that the men thought so that if you drink it you become immortal so leaders from death to immortality so is it as quest for nectar those are symbolic things we should have maybe then you know like we have lemonade at orange juice and cranberry and 1/4 nectar and that's not so funny either because there are millions literally hundreds of millions being spent right now by billionaires billionaires from Silicon Valley on anti-aging the owners of Google and Facebook and everything is it this sort of field now we've done it all we are billionaires at the age of 21 or something like that and the world is at our piece we own the world we have conquered everything that has to be conquered the only thing is dead so let's put since we have been a real successful in doing everything we should we should be able to overcome death also so let's become immortal so they're searching for that the juice of immortality is it that it's some substance it ingesting you become immortal no again it's a journey from ignorance to knowledge we already are emergently to not know it we have to available to our immortal nature how do you do that that's what we are studying here American into the name to the to the awareness that you are immortal the word is changeful you are real the world is unreal it's an F parents they could to that reality let me use it our familiar example which we have become familiar when they talk about the forest in the lake remember I'm not interested in the forest or the lake or the first thing - lake it's an example we're talking about you and the universe so when you look at the forest in the link there pick out any one tree in that reflective forest imagine that the tree there thinks that I am a tree and I'm born and I grow and I die into this dark dank or dark forest and I'm so full of misery and there are these are the bigger trees than me I'm jealous of them until this tiny little creepers at my fruit were just losers you know and potentials of them some trees are nice they're my friends and so and so forth and this is samsara this is samsara then it happens to it over here away that the class going on across the lake and it is told that you are wrong entirely you are not a tree you are the link it's the lake isn't it but if you get a tree there in the lake what is it easy to clean up the link it's nothing it's the water you are not a tree at all step back from your tree nature into your lake nature first of all the person that the reflected tree has to understand what is the lake nature we are supposed to show that posing water look around you it's water look above you it's water look below its water look in in you through and through it's just water the tree appears there you are not a tree step back from the tree nature into the water nature then you will see that you are Louie Lake in the same way when we see the arty body I am a body mind that's exactly like that thing it's a tree it's not a tree never was never will be it's always delayed now we are not without being taught that you know you're late you are rather the lake of consciousness you are the ocean of consciousness our infinite ocean of consciousness in me the body mind appears never am I even when the body mind is appearing I am NOT the body mind step back from the three nature into the lake ledger step back from the body mind nature into the witness consciousness nature okay this is God stepping back from the Unreal to the real stepping back from darkness into light stepping back from dead into immortality that's what we have been doing there is a word in sanskrit called with a Hasina in Quito also you find without Xena it's there in almost all Indian languages the world is like this if most India time which is India or value once I know at least or Oriya the Messiah and I know many of the other Indian languages have it this voyage from Sanskrit usually it is used to be an indifferent neutral do this right Indian Indian language so with us either meets indifferent neutral but if you go to the original Sanskrit root if you go to the Sanskrit root this often the plaza because subtleties are lost when it it comes into common usage but if you go to the Sanskrit root would ask ena Hasina means to sit sitting would means ever it's not just been in and neutral don't care no you raised yourself above you're sitting on a higher seat without seeing a meter reads about Hasina sitting sitting above sit above make a habit of sitting above above this world how do you sit above this world the world is unreal an appearance like the forest in the link you are the real link the existence consciousness bliss sit on reality not on unreality not in the midst of a reality that is sitting above sit notice that you are awareness and everything you have noticed in life everything that you've experienced in life is non conscious intention not aware you are awareness notice that sit in your awareness nature and notice that the world is an object of awareness not aware you are aware of the world nobody is objecting at this point somebody should object and say that what do you mean I have not seen anyone anything sentient all these people sitting and all are they not sense you doubt a zombie's what you think but I said something very precise the only awareness that you have ever experienced in your life is within you is you and everything else that you experience is an object of that awareness I said that and I stand by that statement look around you all these people you say sitting around you what do you experience do you experience their awareness I'm not saying if you're not aware but I'm saying the do you experience their awareness or you experience the body the body you experience the behavior you experience their language if you are a telepath you'd experience their thoughts even then you would not experience their awareness awareness is never an object but it is ever the luminol of objects awareness is never an object you cannot see awareness touch a man this taste awareness smell awareness you cannot even think of awareness really speaking Sami aren't we thinking about awareness no the moment you think about it it becomes an object of awareness you're conceptualizing it will be done this conceptualizing but all the concepts shine in awareness sit ever sit in awareness building sitting in awareness means not sitting in the body it means not sitting in the mind you're sitting above body and mind above I don't think physically I mean metaphysically take your seat in awareness the world is dukkha with you do content and sorrow and suffering and limitation and frustration that's the world that samsara sit alone in your own on this forever you are bliss every bit of bliss in this world is a reflection of the Bliss that that you have within you the ocean of bliss that you are sit in your are on the swarupa sit above that's how uncommon different you know that indifference is a true spiritual indifference because otherwise indifference can be misunderstood as callousness not caring Ness as just being brutal not sensitive you can be fully sensitive you can be fully caring you can be fully engaged in society in doing good to others but you sit above and this sitting above is not imagination now you're sitting in reality early early imagination you are living a half awake life like the Buddha said I am awakened meaning thereby the rest of you are not every into your real nature is the same as sitting about okay that's what the diagram showed the diagram which we which we did yesterday the beatsie which is also such chip on this is also what the word used by the gerund yeah some ah when I would teach in the in the Minassian in builder but the parameter is the novices of course they are wonderful young men they've come to become monks so they are really a very unique and very nice Bunch but they are also students I mean the student a mischievous so they would sometimes make fun brother very spur on man don't you know he's in saga be done in this class on the left side of the board all this brother you can always write prevent death and some of them would ask when a drunk and I'm not good drawing so when I draw at some good somebody would ask what's that [Music] and you know the body has 17 parts myself sockets my brother minded intellect and Jesus only can say the subtle body has three Cobras three sheets the sheet of light pranamaya kosha my teaching the mine sheet metal and ocean and the intellect sheet same thing usually I say mind but not being more precise because we've read of it and there is of course a little consciousness here is in this policy did you feel that way at all and then you have the physical body so usually this is what I think about myself even this one I don't really acknowledge Jolie when it's pointed out we have a master class yes in deep sleep I have some sort of existence that sleep sleep causal body and this is the gross body and oxide varistor weather here is this moon Li and there is a forest that's the word and is the body and here is the mind and beyond that the darkness of deep sleep cause the body such as molecules model the world outside of cortisol to the world body my talks with the world all right now that you logistic step back from the unreal nature into your main region this is the existence this is an appearance step back from the tree reflection into the water whom are we telling the replica tree you are not an elective tree you are the lunate except step back step back from object into consciousness darkness to light step back from death and sorrow here is the tensor because it's change continuous change there is death and sorrow and limitation and suffering step back from that into Anand and watch the word joy you are not worried about this little nail every day every day or every other day you pay off your nails the body is exactly like that song and I'm quoting Swamiji the remarkable passage which have only recently noticed Swami Vivekananda says the subtle body these are the exact words he used metal body grows a physical body much like a physical body except rose hair and nails and one time this is useless unusable it drops up in the subtle body goes on and to other lights and grows other bodies grows within quartz it is not literally grows it gets somebody but you step back and this stepping back remember the stepping back is not a physical stepping back I'm not asking you to jump out of your body it's always remember which is stepping back in knowledge from ignorance to knowledge how can the reflective tree become water how can the reflective tree there become water by knowing it isn't it it is water it just looks like a tree the reflective tree in the lake right now if you go and say do a little bit of way down over there and say that you are not a tree you are live if the tree asks you so called she didn't codes asks you how do I become a lake what did you say if it we asked you just see that it's water you are not its water around you water above me what you have inside the water outside you in fact there's nothing else like a tree in you at all it's not be there it's just water and even you see that through your water you are with this water you are the lake itself it's seeing its understanding its realizing its waking up do you see that that is this very important otherwise between Alaska and all that's nice but give me some practices what am i pray to to become water yeah what meditations should I do and what yoga exercises should I do to become water it has to be seen otherwise you're just prolonging the journey remember and not against yoga exercises or meditation or prayer all those are very good and in fact even essential very helpful very helpful but helpful to what helpful to this waking up this waking up is essential and after 8:00 away Dante's about this waking up all right having said this let's go forward this is not a sign of a longer the next shorter I really notice something in the early if you follow me closely on that example of the lake reflected forests in the tree when I say step back from the tree nature into the lake nature I'm speaking as if there's really a tree and really a leader right this time you know mulch is misleading it's for the purpose of understanding that we have done this but this is not a toy it looks like this is not true is it true in the lake that there is a forest animal E is it true only a few seem convinced the rest are either yes we're just stating now he is gone or what is it doc why does he keep jumping back between forests and lakes and consciousness and all tell me with conviction that reflective forest in the leg in the lake is there a forest no no there's no good it has to be safe you see what's so great about that you know what we just said in me the awareness there is no universe that's what you just said in me the awareness there's no universe it looks like that it looks like a forest it's the lake true and true it's consciousness through and through therefore once you step back from body mind from gross body subtle body causal body not me not me not me neti neti neti once you step back into the reality into the consciousness into a Linda then expand forth again and see that although you step back from causal body subtle body gross body delayed and all the people around and the birds and the sky and the universe all of it the good the bad all of it every tree in that lake is the lake there's no tree it's a lake there is no universe it's you this universe is full of you this universe is in you this universe is you and yet this is magic you are not the universe to understand this the forest is in the lake the forest is full of the lake and the forest is nothing but the lake but the lake is not a forest right yes this is a 2008 under now let me modify the diagram to show you the truth yes it's not like this yes but be careful you cannot do this directly you must step back from it into satchitananda and then look at the world again and see the section on now there are not too early in the diagram there were - it was it was a plural universal consciousness bodies and gross bodies and lakes and trees and whatnot but now it's not - it's one consciousness it's only you non-dual when I am seeing from them yes you would still see it look at the Sun when it shines down on the pot of water you will see that it is a reflection of me there yes you know what is the reflection it's this person you are no longer this person but after that this little person will continue that little person is the small sea it will continue how long will it continue as long as the mind continues then the mind dissolves in deep sleep even the mind resolves after Mukti you are not there anymore but you are never there you are all these pure consciousness you are the one reality filling this entire universe through and through Christie well maybe everybody has understood this and I apologize for being the worst student in the class please forgive me when you say I others I understand everything that you've said and then when we come back and use the analogy of the reflection on the lake it's all understood however the reflection is not real but the sensation is a big but coming there is however the trees are real the trees that are in the water are real so too is that then of course maybe connected and they supposed to the subtle body and the things that we see that a palpable yeah all that you can do is let go of the trees on the bank you see I'm using it as an example no no you must let go yeah otherwise what's happening is you keep thinking three and deflection so this is real tree and reflective tree no there it is in the example it's there but what we are applying it to remember that's why I said certain things you must notice what I said I have given up saying reflected forest and saying forest in the lake the moment you say reflective forest you think what's being reflected so the reason this is happening is lake the water is an incense entity it cannot generate images within itself but consciousness can generate images within itself pure consciousness generates by its own power of Maya this entire universe the appearance of this universe none of you disappear so that's why that that example is nice the way the forest which is reflected in today that forest in the lake you forget what's above the link look at the link and the forest in Delhi look at how remarkable it is it's appearing yet it's not there it's not there in the ladies so this is presupposes that there is a forest that's why there's a lake there's a deflection you know you also use the way morality where waves the lake and they look at fish there because waves we can relate to yes and so but you can apply the same you have applied the same analogy that fits also yes so in this class put this tree using the other kind of wondering why just because they're little bit because ladies every limited source it's so nice and so vivid yes remember again and again I point out examples are very good for pointing out Advaitic truths but it's not about Lakes not about waves not about anything like that it's about you the awareness and this universe you're aware of that's what it is about so whenever you use examples surround which needs to say who for my dishes which means an example is meant to point to example is meant to point out one thing with them alone and the example is used to illustrate something an example will not fit the exemplified totally otherwise it wouldn't be an example so for example when you say as brain vessel I'm that person is I very much is like a lion but would you mean that will you ask why did you see it's like a knife you just go around on all fours and jump on people and eat them up know this figure of speech means is that the person is brave as a lion just a way of speaking here's a bulldog tenacity we just look like a bulldog you don't keep him on a leash so you see no that's not what I meant I meant only the tenacity part of it do you see yeah there is a natural tendency to extend the example too much don't don't and it's it's also a sign of a skillful teacher who can point out where the example applies and where it does not apply snake Road it applies in one sense the clay and pot or gold and out of it water it weight applies in another sense winds because of the action of wind the lake breaks out into ripples and waves so are you saying that Brandon breaks out it the universe because of the wind or something like that does brotherman develop the universe like a rash or something no not at all not at all what does the way when the lake and allergy proof what is it meant to show it's meant to show that the wave is nothing but early wave is nothing but water in every bit of the wave is water that's all nothing else in sanskrit is called a bother the material which constitutes something the material which constitutes the wave is nothing but water the material which constitutes a gold necklace is nothing but but good but it ultimately Brahman has nothing to do with me being worn around the neck or nothing because people misunderstand a ghost which came and beat the invented the gold and beat it into the form of a necklace and now it's a necklace so has somebody come and you know melted Brahmin into this world and now it's over that's not the point at all the only one not only fight the do possessions talk about when they talk about clay and part govern an ornament water it way is that this the substance of the universe is consciousness just as the substance of those trees in the in the lake Italy not outside the truth the substance of the trees in the lake is water okay we're on the same page now examples apply to different muscles different perspectives on different points to be mentioned about Brandon yes right so so that's what that was confusing to me when I was thinking about the reality Emily's reflection yes but other places something else another listen something else could be but in the case of runnin and the universe that's why the only problem is using tips again this is like what we need to try out many people fall into they keep concentrating on the trees outside up there forget that that's not part of the example look at look at em again and again sing look and the forest in the lake okay for the purposes yes this point yes it could be used yes Bronwen is absolutely peaceful increasing unless Shakti does what no it does not move consciousness is unchanging it is only in the realm of Maya that we have changed and it should add it's not that there is an unchanging consciousness and a changing mind and you're back to some here it is an unchanging consciousness in which there is an appearance of change also not it's like saying the river contains the father the link contains the forest yes and if you see the link does not contain a forest yes it enables the appearance of a horse all right now the teaching is going ahead remember the Guru is teaching the student so the next part of the teaching is the Guru says now you are ready to understand the means of the great saying that thou art [Applause] we're back to the whole diagram again on remember sometimes I say Dixie and sometimes is a $30 off some of the name Brandon don't be confused it's all the same and then there is Maya or a media and there is a subtle body not just one there are many of these and the world outside okay now when you see earth - oh I see that thou art this is for this is the great saying from the tund of the opposition one of the ancient Phoenicians in the channel of the Opposition in the 6th chapter and of your petition the teacher who's actually the father tells his son who's a student that thou art I mean the story goes this way that the Sun has been sent out to a school to learn the Vedas and and all that stuff and then after many years comes back very proud of his learning I know a lot and what does this old man know I mean his father that kind of attitude and the father sees in the distance that the boy is proud and so in order to show him that he is not really all that great he asks in this question son in your school in when you went off to college you know did your guru your teacher teach you that thing by knowing which all things are known have you required that knowledge a cavity on ninis aluminum with the atomic gravity but knowing one the technology you will know everything here here makes this word here means everything is doing one thing and the student thinks the white things how is that possible by knowing one subject one knows only one thing that subjective if you know Sanskrit you know Sanskrit if you know metallurgy you know metallurgy if you know archery you know actually but by knowing has people doesn't know everything one by doing one branch of knowledge one cannot know everything how is that possible then the father goes on to teach yes it is possible when you know the substance the material out of which many things have built the one material out of which many things have built the one clay out of which many pots and pans are fashioned parts and jars and such a fashion then you know the reality of all those pots and pans if you know the one material gold out which a variety of ornaments may be made then you know the truth of all the variety of art of its if you know God so what does that mean if you know these substance the material out of which many things are made then that one thing knowing that one thing that material because the material cause all the effects are wrong now immediately must realize if you know it's gold and if the road Smith makes loves of loves of ornaments out of gold then what is it that you know and what is it that you do not know you know that whatever you be made out of that goal it will be goals right but what a particular design it will be what name you will give what brand will it have and find what fans you think you can think of that depends upon the creativity of the goldsmith I don't know but whatever the course with does I can predict right now it will still be gold and nothing else assuming the gold Smith is honestly it will be good and nothing else no matter in what different forms the waves slate breaks out into waves you know whatever happens its water its water so knowing one thing the material cause one knows multiple effects but knows the reality of those effects one may not know the name and farm name in France there can be infinite variety in that way there is one thing in this universe by knowing which everything in the universe is known in that sense in that sense alone it's why people ask a pram mechanic does he know physics and neuroscience and rocket science and psychology and all the languages of the world does he know you say diesel he knows everything does he know yes I don't know he knows all of that is nothing but brother in that sense whatever branch of knowledge you have it is Brahman basically but the details it may or may not know we have to pick it up so meant to pick it up just like anybody else but by going to the library is reading a book or you know we reckon under changes because presumably it was a brother Gavin or a Brahman so why did you have to eat so many books so the details if you want to know the details in Maya you have to follow the same process as anybody else what confuses the issue is that there are Yogi's who have extraordinary powers and they seem to know many more things extraordinarily so people think by being enlightened you will be like that we'll know a lot of details about everything that is through certain yogic powers and it is possible to attain such a certain amount of extraordinary knowledge it has nothing to do with enlightenment okay so having said that now that the father tells the son that there is one thing by knowing which you will know everything in the universe just as by knowing clay one knows all products of clay by knowing gold one knows all products of gold by knowing iron what knows all of the implements made a plan just like that what is that he calls it sucked being existence it is subtle own because of mind appears like this universe but where he appears the universe it is still subtle when the pot where the clay appears as a part what is the pot great is it for it's a form which has been given to and the form exists hand by itself in the air now take the clay away from from from what happened to the father disappeared you know our immediate tendency is to protest and sell that club Clay's a formless lump and you give it a particular form it becomes a part now follow this carefully so what I will argue a part is the clay plus the pot form but the Vedanta may say here's the problem we nobility will say no the play was clay and the part is also clean you might say no it's best for you are making a mistake here plus farm farm is nothing really except plus means you're adding something to it right yeah and the quarter anti deform to it add it be careful while you're using the word and it if it has been added then let me take away my claim show me your phone nothing has been added to it not no thing has been added to it right a farmer is not a thing a farm is not reality in itself it depends on the material to give it reality look at the forest in there everything when the first appears you see it's the lake plus the form of a forest but is it really anything other than Lily no similarly it's nothing other than such pure existence all of this names and forms appear because of Maya and disappear again just like that forest in the lake occurs at a time and disappears at right time okay yes okay hold on to that thought this moksha of undrinkable intend the Buddhist nirvana how would you distinguish hold on to that thought would ask it leaves a more general question we finish this we are not in the midst of discussing that thou art the analysis at this so now let's see what the father told that student was well Mother Teresa was that just as good appears as different forms and different ornaments it's still gold clay appears in different parts and jars it's still clay in the same way son your existence appearances this universe it still sucked pure existence though there are names and forms you see it but you see it all in such impure existence in pure being now the student might go ok good for something but what if what about me but what does it mean to me and the father says that thou art taught to al-maseeh that meaning that these what you my god you are this earth you think of yourself as a young man my son who is graduated from school and coming back and so full of himself but actually you and I and the mountains and forests and this ashram and everything are that sucked that to an a see there is a technical process of understanding this this it's called a maha vaakya great singing let me quickly run you to that we don't have much time and the technicalities are not so important one can one can study that later but let me just put it let me just tell you in brief remember in reality we saw this subpoena fix it brother Raman plus Maya is equal to drama + Olivia ignorance on utility giving cigarettes is equal to Jesus brother Jeeva now here is the analysis actually when you go to a non-dualistic text I'll make a bit of the text this is how they will analyze I quickly run to it if you follow good enjoy we don't talk - I see that thou art that in Vedanta the first issue this is that thou refers to you are right individual you my body you are God creation is not now arrived at this moment you can ask didn't you say that refers to now you are see that refers to run 1 plus mile is it technical there is a problem if you say that refers to Brahman first of all no word can refer to Brahman directly no word can directly refer to brahma because Brahman is supposed to be beyond language how can any work being wrong so but words can be in God you can refer to cover will just accessible about talking about God so that's one problem and the second problem is look at the imbalance in the state if you see Dow you you are this person party night and that refers to pure consciousness how can it be this is on this kind of life that's on that side of life if you want to balance the statement you will talk about this individual and the totality of this sight of my god and the individual these are both are of the same side of Maya both articulate terms and you saying you and God are the same you and issue are insane you are a Brahmin so Brahma here of that here refers to not near Kuna bregman pure consciousness but he sure god that's the approach it takes the direct meaning of that will be will be issuer the direct meaning of 12 the Lao will be g1 individual you and come immediately that leads to problems because all these you are not God I am NOT Vishnu or Shiva or the Father in Heaven or Allah no in fact this is exactly why do lists get enormously upset with us is how dare you claim that you are God it's sacrilegious it sacrilegious to claim that you're God there is a great difference between the individual and God and here the sentencing to this I am God how do you resolve this this is the process I'm leading you to the process why is there a difference whether the texts will tell you God is omniscient and how much do you know very little and then do you forgive men soon God is all-powerful all-conquering very little difference in temperature next existence run so God is off you know tripped up fully satisfies full of bliss and we are how many times you can be satisfied since the morning if the food is late is off by a 10 minutes will be dissatisfied so how can you be God God is all pervading we know I judge how overweight you are you cannot be aggravating it's just a little more than I have already written others but so the individual and God cannot be the same the enormous difference is between God and individual it's it's crazy to say that you are God it's delusional so now the next step is the statements of the opposition's cannot be wrong because they're revealed statements they're realizations of the Rishi's so it must mean something what does it mean now in language in philosophy when a statement does not work thus terms do not match the pterygoid meaning does not apply the presser process the procedure is to take an implied meaning the procedure is to take an implied meaning what is the invite me the implied meaning of now start without implant me now is investigate what you are investigate what you are if you investigate what you are by the process of this the method of agreement of difference which we did is to tell you see the link between this and that what we did yesterday that's why the teacher taught that method are you really my body because in dream you exist but you don't experience the physical body because in each Lee you are there in some sense but you don't experience subtle body and causal and the physical work and in the Somali eunuchs experiences because the body and yet you are there so you are not this money or not this this one you're not this one you can only be the witness consciousness pure consciousness this is the implied meaning of the term power and repeat direct meaning of the term now is this implied meaning of the term dog is this actually actually a lot more technically correct here the direct meaning of the term Wow is this right pure consciousness limited by a by a linear limited by a mind limited by the body and the implied thinking about is this without the limitations how did you come here by the method of analysis of the five sheets by the method of equipment difference by the matter of drink we shall be making a by the method of our structural waking dreaming and deep sleep any of these methods you take up and you come to the realization you are the witness consciousness not an object this is what you are once you come to this conclusion look at what happens to God if you are not this you step god back also from this with God also is nothing but the witness the existence consciousness beyond Maya in that is you are this and God is also and in that sense in the sense of implied meaning alone this sentence makes sense that directly initial and in tightly inviting is is you sure and jiva visual is equal to Jeeva that's what the sentence seems to suggest but it's impossible it just is not true but what they do is in my opinion initial reception are like that implied meaning of Gmail's epsilon and therefore policy is valid only in the sense of implied meaningless not in the sense of what's obvious out there if you say I'm stretching the example again I've become so fond of that foresting will they be transferred if somebody tells in somebody tells that little tree in the forest in the lake you and the forest are one and the same thing revisiting our water tree the forest is 10,000 trees how can I be the same same thing the forest is it goes on and on I am born on a diet and the forest is so mighty and all pervasive and I'm just one little part of the forest how can I be the first so direct meaning of tree and direct meaning of artist do not work if they are not wanting to say but really really speaking the tree is not a tree it's the lake it's the water the forest is not a forest there's no forest there's no tree it's just the water in the sense that the tree is the water in the forest is the water you three are the forest is correct because there is not a tree because there are not a forest because you are not Jeeva individual because it's an equation the moment your individuality disappears you step back from individual it into pure consciousness God also steps back from from godhood into yourself as pure consciousness what this means is I stated earlier that you and I are one in the same thing what does it mean it means there is no god but you and you are you are nothing but God and God is nothing that's why the Advaita is a very radical conclusion they would say there is no Brahma Vishnu and Shiva are management not anything - totally anything except you - really not this body and mind the really and you are nothing but God we are not a body mat so both ways it works so this is the analysis there's a question that I'll come to you the water it's an identity statement okay why hasn't it's redundant statement because yes it's a beautiful question and it's that actually I didn't go into the technicalities but it's impartial question you know what you basically said a logician in fact there are these ancient Indian magicians were - who are actually duelists who hate this kind of solution they will say exactly what he said wait a minute so this is not teaching you know I know one part I'm leaving out let me just point out there Arabic teaching of the Guru is Sharaman analytic asana teaching you here the teaching then you argue about it and then you meditate up - after you're convinced this is the process so we are all in the process of teaching now the argumentation part of it which is what the question he has raised doubts and them working it out intellectually that part is very important and in the book don't forget everything virtual machine we are actually I'm sticking closely to the worse imagery in the book the next verse I'll come back to it because you are such Ananda God is also searched on basically your match the same teaching you are searching on that's it but even many times you introduce the garden to the equation it became very confusing alright so after this verse number 49 the next stage of the teaching starts which is mother um which is argumentation and I'm not going to go into that I am NOT going to touch that because that's a real brain fryer there are many possible are limited questions which may be raised the parties and their books and books and books about this any kind of question you can think of like here is one question it's an important question and got a deal with it but such questions are there alone and only one example has been given here where the questionnaire objects to this very near Kuna Brockman Brockman without any attributes his question is every object in our experience has an attribute has some attributes blue link a red flower a tall man he attributes new attribute itas oh it's so you can speak about it but it is no such thing but that's the question it's a valid question and that's dealt with what is the relationship between attribute and attribute holder is a blue pen so what's relationship between blueness and pen that's the question that's will be taken up and he just touches important in one verse two verses but we did it once few months back in in a valence of society it took more than nothing for one and a half to two hours to discuss that one person it's a really brain fryer I mean the intricacies to go into maybe you don't have time you to do that but it's very interesting basically what we do is the dualist where whose school of thought is actually the ayahs who loves art is one of the schools so that there they are realists and Duellists they are very common sense philosophers and most modern philosophers today would be happy with them they would be most unhappy with us some pure or existence consciousness be so what are you talking about but you know what they talk about the dual license they talk about this there are things okay look at that and things have qualities okay and things perform actions okay this is what they talk about substance quality action relation these are the realities of the world building blocks of the world and you can understand this it's actually much easier to understand if this stuff here after I come in and we are basically starting up at the peak of the Everest that's why it sounds so incredible but we don't have time [Music] philosophy student we you know when you study Vedanta traditionally you'd spend years and years learning grammar of first Nazca travel you'd spend years and years memorizing the Vedas which many years and years learning logic the logic of the deinonychus and all of that before he'd actually opened such books circle but here there is of course where he went in Niharika the dualist attacks do not release by saying substance without quality in their system there are substances and the substances of qualities and this is look at audience look I I actually learned niaaa from a pundit the system of here a very interesting experience and the subject was nothing nothing but in Sanskrit Amhara accents nothing and for it was for 15 days pile our city for five hours a day 15 days we spoke about nothing and he loved this subject I still remember it it's quite impressive he would he would come wearing the traditional dhoti and one thing which you really set in Hawaii was good careful unite with the chalk and on a blackboard he would write a Sanskrit verse and the students who are from different universities I was the only monk but other students some of them a young people and they wouldn't be bothered to take it down with a pen and paper to stick up mobile and take a picture and the pundit will provide you know they are never going to rededicate it remain in the bottom abaya if there is father to write it down it they took the residence anything so he would teach and it's going to remarkable you'll give him a cup of tea like this lemon and if you have a cup of tea and the saucer and the teacup you will hold it ideally he would sit and speak but he would forget and we would try and around the stage speaking with the cup of tea precariously balanced on the sausage and you would do that for one and a half hours and till the break 90 minutes and the tea would be absolutely cold but you'll be so absorbed in it nobody could do can you put know it with the G sometimes so in the ayah their idea of the world is everything has substances and their qualities so these look at look around there are substances and qualities now he's saying that how can you talk about Brahman which is clearly something it exists right so it's something and has no qualities at all it's not possible and so what do you reply is the non-diverse replies reply is a real nice a body glow he says okay let's look at your system of thought substances are qualities what's the relationship between substance and quality give you a little example here is a substance and the quality right it's nothing very abstract belief is substance and it's green green is because it and the quality according to them stays in the substance just stating the substance because qualities we had substances really and the relationship between dentistry so if the ground is a relationship is relationship a relationship between the quality of substance how does the quality stay in the substance they talk about relationship between the different kinds of relationships now the non-dual is philosophy so this is real yes this is real yes this is real yes and this relates to things to real things yes if this is real and this is also here then these personas be related somehow here however suppose related to the lake you can't say an anonymous America for example wouldn't be able to see because thing is there's no real forest in the way so how would you say it it appears alright so you leave it at that I'm coming back to your question your question was that thou art if you say that means this one and now these that this one basically what you are saying it is it in logic these are called tautologies total logical statements and these statements are worthless if I say the Sun is the Sun ladies the lake so if you see the lake is blue you have Tony something the latest big rig is cold it told me something but you say lake is lady aren't you doing that here that means from Bao means from that now our problem is problem that's what you said is this true No the way nothing says actually the non-dual is the duelists they raise Disick this question is there in in dualism they say it becomes a tautology a redundant statement hence this cannot be the meaning if there are different words that's the different per thousand different word it must mean different things it cannot be the same thing so we asked the dualist what does it mean tell us that means God each one as you said and it now means you and the relationship is not is equal to but you are subject to the will of God because in sanskrit grammar you can do that that thou art you can split it up into a mercy that a leaner policy you are you are a subject of the Lord the Lord is our King in dualistic religion and Lourdes is a lot a lot of the universe you are subject that's what it means two different things that means they are completely different from you and now means you separate from the Lord and the Lord is the Lord and you are the subject that's what it means according to the dr. list according to the twist the qualified Manas will come in here and say look that now what means you are a part of God not that you are gone so it expresses a relationship God has the whole thing apart but you are God that means Brahman and now it's Brahman death it's problematic what's our impact the reply of the novelist not only says all sentences which have different words they do not record ssibly two different things for example what was the argument if the words are different they must mean different things so it cannot be knowledgeable we want these words to be one thing but the dual is see they cannot be one thing mean different things our answer is there are certain statements in which different words mean the same thing every day we chant stop acharya to thermosphere serve a thermos were opening the establishment of religion embodiment of all religions to the preeminent among avataras i salute ramakrishna now look at the words ramakrishna preeminent among avatars establishment of religion embodiment of all religions so many different words but they all refer to one be you know differ to different things so there are sentences in which you may apply many things objectives and so on they all refer to one thing so this is such a sentence in sanskrit there are technical terms for this their sentences can be in sanskrit some are not eternal deity correct some are not eternal literally means all the words will pluck and refer to one locus one locus all the words different words and sentence refer to one locus when there are no means the different words in a sentence refer to different low-side different objects the classic example they give is done laying around on Io in sanskrit tipo tens a shepherd boy take a stick and bring the cows home so the boy is different the stick is different the cows is different and bringing the bow on that attraction is different in different things different words meaning different things but some sentences are like this different words meaning the same thing so this sentence is like that does it take care of the redundancy problem yes it does what what's the purpose of saying Brahman is promise the purpose is this two things are same they seem to be different in order to eradicate the aberrant illusionary difference this sentence is necessary for example when I say it's a specific example so any day without that this is the same develop let's use John this is the same John you are the same job same John whom I saw in say New York 30 years ago I'm seeing now in Vancouver 30 years later you are younger then your hair was black and now your order your hair is white and that time you were in New York and now you're in Vancouver yeah at that time that was 30 years ago and now is 30 years later so many differences with yet I mean it's the same person right in the same way all the differences that's God the ruler of the universe you are a little human being so many differences in order to eradicate those differences to show that the differences are illusory I say you Oh puny human being are one and the same as his magnificence God because God is also searched and you are also searched Ananda because this is something that we do not know in order to know this statement is necessary that's what I'm trying to say in order to eradicate difference if it was known and there's some examples are also given I forgotten investing philosophy did self that the evening star is the morning star Venus evening star and morning star this Sun yes there's a examples in that the philosophy is the primary classes in philosophy sir remember exactly two different names for the same celestial body so you have to say the evening star is the morning star because though you are referring to the same celestial body Venus but people think they're two different things something like that that's the answer to a question you know the question qualified service the word implicit implies the the implication the implied meaning takes you from the qualified meaning to the non qualified satchitananda when you have the direct meaning direct meaning is the meaning of the word when you see you you obviously need to meet that you this person because if you are sitting on a chair the direct meaning moving here I am here this body and mind that's what you are referring to that's what sitting on the chair that's the direct meaning of you but the implied meaning of you is examine yourself am I the body I might we might know you go straight back to such a colander so searched under is the implied meaning of the term you and is also the implied meaning of the term that that means God direct thinking of that is God direct meaning of mouth is this person implant meaning of tau such she doesn't implied meaning of that God if my meaning of that is a cheetah yes it's implied because that's not the first meaning that comes to your mind when you when you hear the word and also it has to be implied because no word technically can refer to run yes so is the ultimate reality talkable can you speak about it which is that the way they would say yes we are going to speak lots about it and tourists will say yes it will feel are the books and books and books about it but the non do list is a problem with an honor is defying brahmana's beyond language if it is beyond language yes you're going to use language the punches machines language you're going to use language to talk about something that can cannot be expressed in language how do you do that how do you do that you find it out pointed out means you can't physically point it up just a problem I can't might not run into you so it has to be very skillfully approach so that you intuitively grasp it all of this you see what can be pointed out I can point out the physical chief fuchi i can point out the vital she I can point out the mental treatment that means for you you can indicate that's what have a thought yes that's the mentorship two plus two is four I understand am so and so yes that's the intellect sheet deep sleep experience that's the brief bliss sheet I am pointing out but beyond that the art but I can't point it out you have to catch it that's what is meant by implied meaning yes it is from gross to subtle to settle into subtler none of which are actually on one they are not be allowed to be pointing it out this approach we are getting a lot of other words discussion yes yes so he says in this way we are going through a lot of argumentation and reasoning and you know breaking our heads or it bypass the real discussion which was never would have taken one and half to two hours but isn't it better he says Patanjali yoga method you sit in meditation and calm down the mind and the self is ready to you better I said right without any questions can imply let me add until you are the traditional Vedantic pundit would say you want to overcome ignorance with knowledge and now you are saying it's too much trouble to go to class and we books and listen to lectures I just sit quietly this is a point to it but you are saying but I'm giving you a non-traditional anonymous Twitter respond to that would respond to it what are we doing what's the project here that we project is overcoming ignorance can ignorant be overcome by going to sleep [Music] yeah for focus the IMing I see I'm not against it I I understand it I can take that position also but right now I'm taking the position it's good to know the position of classical of atavism they will say see here we are whole ideas to work of ignorance can you overcome ignorance by focusing is focusing necessary there's a different question yes you want to learn something in college do you need to focus of course but he's focusing in our dance no if you say will clear the doubts the potential you're given say you can you not allowed to have doubts you supposed to stop the doubts because you're not supposed to think out your thoughts so no thinking their idea is the consciousness is always there if you settle down the ripples on the lake up surface of the lake of the mind it should become obvious there is an argument the knowledge which say it should become obvious in even you fall asleep because there's no ripples on the lake of your land it doesn't until we began teach point it out it doesn't it needs to be pointed out that's the pedantic argument you see they will tear down the position at many points why do you need to quite in the mind down to absolute silence because then in the cell reveals itself in its real nature that's the Sutra Roger in the Patanjali yoga Sutra then without it we'll ask and at other times when the mind is active or the self becomes identified with the movements of the mind that's the next Sutra parenting we'll say that's not the self we are talking about even when the mind is moving all sorts of thoughts has the pure consciousness become identified or is it still a human is a human of the mind in movement it's the governer of the mind in Samadhi in both cases it is completely unchanged will you say that when the leaves of the forest move in the little parcel of the lake when the leaves move the lake becomes the forest only when the forest is absolutely quiet no movement in the forest then the lake will be seen separately from the forest no this difference is talked about by Medusa then Saraswathi in the bhagavad-gita chapter 6 29th worse this question came up that's why I know this reference chapter 6 29th worse where's Medusa themselves with you who's a non duelist he says the method of meditation and the method of discrimination which are these are two paths which have been given by Sheila he coats yoga vasishta Shiva gave these to Royal Roads to enlightenment then it first takes up the path of Raja yoga there's a whole paragraph damage is made mentions he says for the followers of Sankhya literally says followers of your negative because integral by the term did the sonken's use for the first good for forgot anything for the followers of sound here there is no way other than Samadhi because very interesting they regard the world is real the world has to be blanketed out the word world has to be submerged first in Samadhi then you begin to realize what you are apart from the world you and the world have to be seen separately you see the same example this one this one this separation can be done by Somali only you have to experience it then you realized yes I am NOT the body not the mind nothing to do with this world let it stay and the luminaire of this thing let it go I still remain that's what Raja Yoga is it gets you where it gets you which is fair enough that's great then the next paragraph he says but for us it clearly says but for us the followers of Vedanta the followers of Patanjali yoga not followers of Islam but for us the followers of Vedanta our revealed teacher Shankar Acharya he mentions my name our revered teacher has said that the realization of the falsity of the world is enough to reveal that you are wrong the world doesn't have to be drowned out in Samadhi you just realised the word is not there it's just you Prem let me use that example beautiful if that's you see how powerful that example is the forest in the lake one thing Raja yoga says is you have to wait until dark when the forest does not appear in the lake to realize that the lake is different from the forest there is no forest here is the lake so the lake is different from the forest otherwise I think [Music] they're on time [Music] Arata otherwise in daytime when the forest appears in the lake the lake becomes identified with the forest and there's no way of distinguishing the lake from the forest that's what they rally or is it fair that good fight but when Arthur says distinguishing the forest from the lake is possible because there is really no forest in Lake it's a matter of understanding it's not that in the daytime there is a forest in the night time there is no first so to wait till nighttime to realize that this only a lake not forest it's no you you have to wait till somebody to realize that you are separate from the from pro-treaty that's what Patanjali Yoga says as non-dualistic saying that if it is available in Samadhi you have they usually use in determining love me priyanka somali in jail have a vodka beer you have put your beloved in the jail of samadhi you have put enlightened my brother and god whatever is you've locked it up in the chain of samadhi only when i go to somebody I can see otherwise at this time it's your loss we know that's kind actually do you do that you can establish with the door hmm then even if it appears to be blue then you know that it's actually black it is true but also there's a problem a problem is this according to samkhya and but enjoy yoga the world is real so when it's appearing to you it's a real world appearing to you and you need to maintain your distance from the real world you are pollution your whole problem was getting entangled in a real world whereas padartha says your whole problem was thinking the world is real it's nothing other than you once you realize with the world and tears or does not appear it's fine with you word appears is not fine with us for a fertility yogi the purpose is to retreat into Samadhi again I'm taking a non dualist position what you are saying ultimately it's correct because the Samadhi is meant for that knowledge once you have that knowledge one Swami put it this way I'll stop here once I put it this way very nice he says the essential thing to see is that you are in the audience you're not part of the plane now whether it's a plane in the open in theatres with real actors as a real stage Sankhya all its a movie on the screen Vedanta that's an interesting question but in both cases you are not part of the plane that's the thing you've to realize right now our real problem is we think we are part of the plane all right don't just a plane it's a nightmare for us [Music] [Music] dragging the mind along it's an active instrument yes and it will do mischief if you don't use it right yes and it has to work in conjunction with other message the other gopis yes that's it I don't feel about Uncle crazy they think I open a philosophy there's a matter of fact encyclopedia Oxford about two hours next morning from the activity right a morning dementia yes verified what you're saying the other fun more subjective levels the logic cannot be denied yes you cannot put it that's my circle that is why Srilanka is important if you try to struggle through it by yourself it's torture here is step by step this is why is it up to you once this is pointed up to you you have reached a place of safety from that point from that vantage point you can look at the mind doing philosophy are not doing philosophy any happy with it yeah you are it's nothing to do with you alright let's wrap it up tau this was a good session yes but did you check him out to the Nikita Oh is Shanti Shanti and I wanted to do the teaching pattern then the sort of sidestepped a reasoning part sure enough another day with the asthma but we had a good reasoning session here so that happened so the last session we are caught today is on the meditation part of it there will be a different session we will not only talk about it but try to experientially so feel it be in it sort of bring everything to a culmination very you
