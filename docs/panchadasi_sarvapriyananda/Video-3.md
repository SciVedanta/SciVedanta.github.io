[Panchadasi - Lecture 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAak_FzLae8)

Oh leaders from the unreal to the real leaders from darkness into light leaders from death to immortality so what we did in the morning was absolutely the sense and the most important thing that we are going to talk about if you have to think to think of our patents and their to what we did in the morning then third verse that you are the consciousness in which you have experiences that thing try to get your mind around acting try to understand and appreciate what that is say that's absolutely the sense that's the key that's the secret key to unlock the door and afterwards from now onwards we will have stories without details and it will not now about Brahman and sat-chit-ananda existence consciousness bliss that's my real nature we say that what we tried to say in the first class in the first talk many questions arise at this point and many questions arise at this point and now that we must deal with these questions these questions we must answer these questions we will take it as at a leisurely pace now for this class and tomorrow onwards remember what we're going to discuss now and tomorrow onwards now at tomorrow and almost to the day after it will be a story let me tell you the story in increase innovation will be first and then we will go into the text here is the short version of the story Alan Watts who was a pretty clever man philosopher who taught in the Bay Area San Francisco perceptive his British so he taught there for some time he was very much into Vedanta he was into whom Buddhism and very witty very humorous so he told the story he said if people ask me explain the secret of what's going on here what's the meaning of all of this this is the answer that I give you should I tell them a story and the story he says usually little children understand it faster when grown-up people story is this God is all that existed ever never but existing for ever and ever God got a bit lonely all by his lonesome self so God decided in order to have some fun that God would play hide and seek but who would God play hide and seek with because there is none other than God regarding each upon a clever plan to play hide and seek God hit upon a clever clever plan what was the plan that God decided to be not God God disguise himself as not God not that meet God disguise himself as a human him and the rock and the tree planets phantoms not God and began to play this game of hide and seek and it went on Mary it was a nice plan that the game succeeded and there God was having a lot of fun but the problem was God being God was awfully good at what he did pretending to be not God he really really forgot that he was God and then the game became a nightmare forgetting his God nature now he is trapped in this nightmare and seeking a way to go back to get out of this so that is the whole secret of this universe of life that's what's going on here that's the answer to the question what's going on here what is this it's a beautiful story actually now what we're going to read from now on is exactly that story but told in a much more philosophically in vedantic language it should be taken as seriously or as non seriously as that story because will answer regards what will come now as a story to be dismissed well and it will itself be dismissed to sometime you telling a story and dismiss it what is the purpose of telling you the story enlightenment is the purpose helping God find his way back home God found his way back to his God nature that's the only only part what are the questions which come up when we listen to what we listen to the morning if you really stop and it's a nice thing to listen to that you are infinite consciousness infinite existence infinite bliss okay but then when you really sit down and think about it questions come first question is look I do not really experienced myself that way if there is a brahman which is existence consciousness bliss that I might believe in it but if you tell me if you have the audacity to tell me I am existence consciousness place my objection is well I don't really experience myself that way I experience consciousness yes I am aware I know that I have something called a vase and it's clear but I really don't experience it as infinite awareness one unconscious percept event no I experienced it as a kind of empirical awareness and see I hear it's undeniable I smell I taste I suffer I enjoy I think I desire I remember I forget that's the nature of my awareness this infinite existed in consciousness you're talking about which is persisting through eons we just talked about it neither rises in our sense one unchanging consciousness I don't really experience myself as that yeah question it should come infinite existence I know that I exist I know that you exist that these things exist but I do not see this existence as some kind of infinite existence I rather see it as I think I was born I exist I am changing and I think I'm going to die things are born of things done things are created things to start destroyed things changed this unchanging mortal existence no no I don't experience it that the third thing you said I'm a source of permanent happiness and the highest happiness to myself I can see the logic in that but I don't feel that happiness is something I am i I mean I I feel I should feel it why call it happiness if I can't achieve it I don't feel that kind of happiness I feel happy sometimes and with most of the time and I'm seeking a more permanent happiness that's as much as I can say with confidence but this unchanging permanent happiness highest happiness is my own self I don't see that it so these are my problems if that is true what you said why don't I see it that way why do I see it this way question number one did you see then other questions will be there if existence consciousness placed according to me that is the only reality in what is all this this flume lake if I am a resistance consciousness bliss clearly there is a body and a mind it seems to be my reality why did this body and mind come and what is this body in my question what is this world what I am I right now this world doesn't seem to be searched on under existence consciousness I also don't seem to be searched on I seem to be a body mind the words it seems to be a place of living and non living entities so where did all this come from why did it come and the question of religion if you're talking about well doctor but you're not school about guardianship speaking about some kind of existence consciousness place so what about God questions what are the questions this is the second set of questions what is the first at the present no don't forget first question is you said sulci domina I am such an ass but I don't see it that way why not that's the primary question the second set of question says I see this as a word body might may become an estate so questions about God word and myself that's the second set of questions the third sister questions would be what is called bondage and liberation bunda moksha I seem to be in trouble and suffering why so why did I get into this problem what is this nature of this problem of a human situation and how do we get out of it how does God know himself as God how does how do I know myself I searched on of them that's the last question so these questions have to be answered and the answers will start now as I said the answers are a story why do you see their story because ultimately they which is dismissed why will they be dismissed because ultimately without the same Brahman alone is really the word is an appearance so when you are talking about the world and yourself and this thing you're talking about an appearance what's not - according to an athlete should not true it's an appearance you want an explanation of something that's an appearance something that's false same tradition also will be false it will be a story it will be a story because ultimately what does we have to say only searching on the misery of the existence consciousness places where you are asking this about something that may not the considers to be an appearance unreal so I'll tell you a story about it to satisfy you need to know you need to know the story now you might ask why this venom takes tourism basically what what are we going to say when you studied Middleton knows the story is going to come there is my own drama is predicted as the five elements no sky and fire earth and water and so on and so on by a mixture of these five elements the worlds are created bodies created life is created and in this life that is mind and in mind consciousness plus mind reunite and we become limited individuals we desire we suffer and go through this cycle until we realize ourselves as such at our and existence consciousness space so this is the story but this story is not true because only brown one is true you might ask at this point if the story is not true why not attacked a true story let's say this story of Sciences there was a big bang and there was a formation of stars and planets and evolution and coming up that is a much more acceptable story today but that's the that's the truth if you are saying you have a nothing story is a story will actually give you something that's not a story that science where another would say that's also stirred why if searched Alain Delon is true then the rest of it Big Bang down to here sitting in public here rest of it has to be history it's such an underdog miscue from the point of vinata even science is history why preferred what story about the other because science is a story which helps you to understand this word and to manipulate the forces of this world technology and science and you could you get a much better in-depth understanding of what's going on here that's true well an tech knowledge is that but what will I have to say is your point in coming to awaken the class it is not to learn about this world and how to design better iPhones and and medicines no those are laudable pursuits but they are persons in the world out there you are already doing that your goal here is to attain enlightenment from the gamma God has to find himself as God that's the goal for charcoal this story the Vedantic stood is usable the story that we are going to tell in the next few classes is using the scientific story is also sturdy and a very good story at that but it's not directly useful for enlightenment this is directly useful so with that proviso in mind let's go into it take it seriously but not to see this what should you take seriously what we did in the morning to them that they are also only the third person go into that if you can get it as a fact I talked about it once in a while we try to prove it to that one set of identification comes up having said that let's start work [Music] [Music] we're taking of the first of the questions I mentioned some look quizzical yeah what was the first question the first question is if I had cheated on the why don't they see that way why don't I see it you just said I have the nature of infinite bliss but I don't I don't experience myself as the rough nature of any kind of bliss let alone infinite so why not what's the problem and we learn that starts the tape answering the first question yes there is a problem there is a problem what is the problem not one fact if the self-penned not evident then it will not be the object of our highest love we just started the set by the logic and then and last class that we using reason that our really ultimately everything is done for the sake of the self because it's the it's what we love the most though we consciously don't seem to think to stick sir but everything that we do even the things that we love the most out there all of them are ultimately meant for the happiness of the self so by that logic we love the self the most so in the self they're not evident as the source of highest love the source of highest joy we would not learn at the most and repeated endeavors the segment not at all I didn't then we would not love it the most there's something within us which is the source of the highest joy or liking that's why our greatest love is for the self but here's the thing if it were totally in it it absolutely clear then we would not go around seeking happiness two things in the world outside in the infinite bliss nature bliss nature of the self are evident I could actually feel it like enlightened people to win it to actually experience themselves their inner inner reality as infinite place then the consequence immediately is they do not seek happiness anywhere outside proof look at the rise over any enlightened for whom we consider to be enlightened spiritual masters of humanity in any religion in any tradition one thing is they're entirely self-sufficient they find joy within they are not crazy like us to run up to things of the world because we want them somehow we think we want them why do we want them because without that I wouldn't be happy unquestioned and we spend our life the entire life pleasure money power even learning creativity nature could carson's something of the other of them because that's the source of happiness and it seems to work also to some extent it seems to work we do get pleasure out of that they do get some kind of happiness but not permanent not changing but not not unchanging not the highest not satisfied in long run we still keep seeking if on the other hand you look at the lights of enlightened people they seem to have found something which is an inexhaustible source of joy and peace and bliss whether it's a devotee in the path of love whether it's a meditated was realized to Samadhi whether on the path of knowledge whether it's someone like on the path of knowledge Who am I normally machi whether it is totally who has got some realization within which allows him to wander the surface of the earth naked without a single thing in the world and still happy whether it is with her or Christ or anybody so they'd have got something which did after which they don't need anything the fervent Gita says getting that after which nothing greater remains to be God having attained that from which even the greatest of sorrows cannot shake you interesting but even I am retaining that sorrows will come so as we come the world will continue as it is but nothing can shake you any more because you have attained that so that is not clear to us that is not clear so what he's saying is the self is not totally obscure because after all we see that it is the object of our greatest love everything is done for the sake of the self automatically but it's not completely evident also because we keep running up the things in the world outside that's what he said here is the problem do you notice I don't deny entirely that unconscious I see myself as conscious but not as an infinite consciousness you are speaking about that's not very clear to me I do not deny that I live I make you know I'm living I'm sayin I'm dead or I will not exist I do live I am existing but I do not see myself as an infinite existence you're talking about I had a happy sometimes least but I did not see myself as that infinite source of places are talking about this is the nature of the problem why is it happening why is it happening and 12th person a dream uncommon esta aqui esta put canister Barney yharnam Donna's body yamaraja Prati bunting you dirty rat even the example used here is a peculiar example from ancient India where children were sent up to Vedic schools to memorize the Vedas and recite them so if you even though there are these traditional schools if you go there and in India you will find little children usually pious because not at all very very very gender-neutral citizen Patriot the boys would be set up to these schools to memorize the Vedas the teacher would repeat a line and up the kids would chant it out back and that's not they would memorize now parents are of course always interested in seeing their kids performing so here are the parents going to see their star pupils with their son chanting the Vedas now when we reach the school what happens we hear the chanting but all the kids are chanting together but the parents are not interested in hearing all the kids chanting together they want to hear their own son that's some time our nama Krishna mission schools speak we run our author Reza number of schools in India so one of the schools day over and four hundred kids study different advice they study there is littered the study in clay and so the evenings around this time when the kids are playing their twelve play drums and the kids are playing and sometimes parents come to visit now with more hundred kids from little kids to grown up images they're all playing in their own playground and the paintings come but I had to notice something amazing parents would zoom in unerringly on one playground and one team of kids and one new player so you wanted to know know how my son is chanting but what is the problem chanting is going on clearly your son is chanting but you cannot the problem is interesting can you hear your son chanting and say yes and no technically yes because everybody's chanting in in that in that chorus my son's voice loud so there is of course correct but matter what I wanna what I wanted I want to hear that voice separate from the rest that I cannot hear so the thing is some of the chanting is there and get it not there what is the problem there is an obstruction what is the obstruction it is the simultaneous simultaneous chanting of all the other kids okay this is the example now today's this a problem is an obstruction in the same way in our world right now in in this experience I am infinite existence consciousness bliss are we experiencing it most of us who will say no and not but but without the tells us you are you are and yes you are not there is an obstruction there is a problem you know when when a person becomes enlightened what does he or she what does it what does it feel like he does not feel like oh why was a body mind and here the world now I get it it's from an out there it's okay but not like that what happens upon enlightenment is something like this and you suddenly feel oh my god it was there all along I had never heard never noticed it it was been continuously I didn't notice it I didn't realize it I didn't see it I didn't get it now I got it so I'm gonna come to puts it this way it's like a trick picture once you see it it won't fool you again you can see it anytime you want to trick picture do you know that it looks like a mass of dots but if you look closely at what they are told that there is a tiger and a forest hidden behind the tree there's a tiger when you look it looks like a mess of touch when you look closely you begin to suddenly see all the leaves and the branches and what's this face of the tiger but you're hiding behind the leaves and the bushes there I see it once you see it it may take some effort looking to and let the things fall in place but once you see it you know the amazing thing is you look at it again you look at it it's a mass of dots but now you know the trick of how to see just the tiniest bit of effort and you see it again is it not trying to seeing this thing in childhood I have you seen this kind of an illusion right so once you see if you've got it forever and the feeling is it was always there and our side it's not what was always there and yet I did not get it it's because of an obstruction here the obstruction his kids chanting together and what is the obstruction which is preventing us from experiencing and already existing in very much present existence consciousness bliss the answer we know being long time term enough students the answer they're going to give is the home of an old answer Maya is going to come but first he wants to talk a little bit about obstruction what's an obstruction it's very clear what an obstruction [Applause] [Applause] what is an obstruction there is something it exists it's manifest an obstruction is something that comes and an entity which exists and manifests and what you do to it the obstruction comes and hides it and it looks like it's not manifest anymore it doesn't exist existing and manifest obstruction comes in hyeon's your vision so it feels like it's not manifest I can't see it anymore and maybe doesn't exist that's the effect of an obstruction it's as simple as the Sun is very clear but a cloud comes or the moon comes more more relevant enough and suddenly it becomes dark now what happened blazing forth it's clearly manifest the Sun what can be more manifest in that out there so much light and it exists it shines and it exists the moon comes for a brief few minutes above it it does not shine who knows maybe the Sun doesn't exist the old Indian fable is there Rahu has eaten it up or something the demon has come and eaten it up in the same way the point is in what is clearly there we don't see that right now the enlightened person sees brother and the infinite existence consciousness places it is and it is shining for but because of some obstruction for us our experiences no it's not shining both I don't see any anywhere and probably doesn't exist who knows I don't even know whether it exists so that which exists and shines forth because of an obstruction our experiences it doesn't shine for maybe it doesn't exist for me now I was going to point out that my ignorance me llamo Akane banana so what's the obstruction in the example it's the chorus of the voices of all the children that's what is making you feel I can't hear my son's voice I wonder if he's at all chanting he is and it's part of the chorus but you can't hear it distinctly because of the chorus so the chorus is the obstruction and what is the obstruction in our case why can't we see for America experience Perlman anomaly Romania beginningless ignorance ignorance is the obstruction we just bury fact that you don't know it is the obstruction that's all it means ignorance this ignorance is the obstruction do you remember yesterday how we started up but I pointed out depending on how you construct the problem the solution will also be accordingly and I printed out in the path of knowledge the problem is seen as ignorance so you see how he's coming to it it's predictable it's come around to that the really problem is ignorance and here we are going to give you knowledge which will remove this ignorance all right so ignorance is the problem we are all waiting an event around the only cause of delusion what delusion there is no problem there is infinite existence consciousness twist no it doesn't shine for some existence is that some awareness is dead little bit of happiness is there but is infinite existence consciousness face are changing it's logically abdomen demonstrated it in these pages but it's not obvious to us the wearing that this is not obvious is because of ignorance we do not know it is seeing a snake somebody tells you it's a row there's a rope there and you say no no no this is snake I can see clearly see the snake where is the Rope the Rope is not evident probably there is no room not evident does not show it does not exist this is because of ignorance the obstruction force obstruction ignorance of the room here and obstruction is ignorance of ourselves as such even existence consciousness with ignorance of what not physics chemistry or biology or Sanskrit or French no ignorant of ourselves as such another as existence consciousness please now what will happen is is introducing a new character to the story remember all this is a story because all this will be dismissed in the end and we'll be back to sunshine and so what is the new character it's called Maya or priority three words in Sanskrit they all be the same thing Maya priority this Maya our property according to Vedanta this is something borrowed from Santa this is composed of three gunas we know separatist Thomas we know in Vedanta so when there is preponderance of sackcloth of the element of purity if you are not familiar with this don't be disheartened don't be and don't bother also because it's a story after just take it as something that's there and okay we will get rid of it soon enough this is Network this word practically also is used here it is composed of rogers what is what are these these are the three aspects of Maya or practically practically literally means nature practically means nature three aspects the aspect of of inertia our dullness darkness laziness and solidity God Thomas the aspect of energy and dynamism man and desire and activity called Rajas and the aspect of serenity and calmness and other alertness and points called subtle one is obstructed the other one is creative but generates desire and activity the other other one is equalized peaceful so these are three qualities and we find them within ourselves of these three qualities these are not qualities of random remember brother mother does not have qualities these are qualities of Maya or property now this story can be told in different versions there is one worship which the teacher presents here between a presence here what does he say he puts it in this way he says when the when it is more of subtle and less of Rajas and Tamas more acceptance and less of brothers and Thomas let's call it why this is more son and it is more registered by the suppress and remember all clear present because you can all see have to be present together and probability is Thomas so the three different dates are used here by a Gregory Sado one name is Maya Olivia and one vs predator they all refer to the same thing but different aspects of the same thing and they have different functions what are the functions and what happens now in the story is this understood that they're all the same thing probably be circular discuss with different functions what was the first character of our story the original character sat-chit-ananda Brahman right which we are supposed to be so here is Gina this is scholar run now run plus my plus mile together is called issue of religion who is the god of religion not my same section and when it puts on the uniform of Maya becomes evil the same person he puts on the the dress-up of avid Oh Tina and each other it becomes the Poojari in the temple same person after performing the puja when he goes home and puts on the uniform of a policeman becomes a cop on the street same person that he puts on his pajamas and goes to bed until the person who's sleeping but the person is the same same person depending on the dress remember the the priest in the temple is not the dhoti it's the same person the policeman is not the tress and the sleeper one is sleeping in bed is not the pajamas it's the person so because of the press the the name is different activities are different and characteristics are different such anomalous moral is issuing such an ax + Olivia arrogance ignorance is Jeeva the technical term used this product here the reasons for this I'm not going to you should try me whose project you are me but in what state though the individual as we find ourselves in our deep sleep state in our deep sleep state what you are when you are in deep sleep that's this project what is that search it on the cover by the darkness of ignorance that is project this is the individual in sanskrit the Jeeva the English individual you you see just a minute you told me that I'm a gentleman yes you are but since you find it difficult to believe I'm going to tell you the story and show you how you are exactly what you see yourself as now from such a journal that will come to exactly as you see yourself as now and then we will take it back to such a ton of the game so that's the story this is what you experience yourself in deep sleep and the the claim is in deeply you are infinite existence consciousness list but just eaten by ignorance all right now property is domicile this study done on the plus property same thing it produces the universe Jagat you see one of the questions we asked already gave answer two questions the first question was 100 defined if I am set you down at the why don't I see myself asserted under the answer was my ignorance the second question we asked if you remember what is all this but all this you have asked about three things Jeeva Jaya me the world and perhaps that explain these three in terms of your honor so the answer is Brahman the smile is God Brahman plus your individual ignorance not theoretical what you feel right now if you yourself admitted it that searched on the infinite existence consciousness bliss I don't feel it then I am filled by your own admission that's called event they are ignorant so that's the chief of the individual you meet him all beings of this universe this and not that because there are many difference millions and billions of them so Alethea is many Maya many on one watched because there is one God priority than your one one but it changes but evolves changes into the universe if you want at this point to plug in science with other books ever written here it explains whatever explanation you give when others have you did it there's no problem because after Ramadan despite of you it's a story the whole point is to go back there all right so that's the story we're going to see ya how does may not explain God the universe and you you means mainly use all of us that's the explanation let's read the next few verses [Music] [Music] [Music] is that in which there is a reflection of Raman pure consciousness in place and is composed of such garages and covers it is of two kinds two guys me actually three this faculty said is a one time here one time here and here we talked about this one which Sagittaron is becomes God rested on the true this one becomes God through this one becomes you and me through this one becomes this universe how it happens is going to be talked about now story in detail sixteenth verse subversion we should be young subversion we should be gown my of integer day money my oven Morishita Thomson but more subtle more suffered the same parity score mile less - I motorists the same practice for immediate fire in logistic immediate which one the same entity by implication more Thomas rapidly spirited self-nature now says we are consciousness shining upon Maya is now from this side God God Brahma such a talented runner see through the lens of a time space and causation is the god of the universe pure consciousness is it all powerful and loving and kind and good you cannot speak about it in those terms at all it's an impersonal reality beyond all human beyond all qualities you can't say that it is very violent and just and nice and loving it no or it gives reward or punishment no but in combination with Maha Kali is a knowledge ascribed to Sachin under this is brother but what Rama the real drama is nil guna without qualities this is the absolute the absolute reality ultimate reality it becomes fun when otherwise advaitha venom is not really about God it's about something Bianca it's not really about the individual you it's beyond you it's not really about the world it's beyond the world what is it what will what we love wants to see is cheap if the reality which we look at it as god world and the tears adherence the reality searched ah that's what a great without us try to do this and one thing I would like to add here is something interesting what we not normally see this brother supreme Brahman alone is real Java with TR the worries and appearance and Jeeva you from Needham you are none other than round and repeat that again one way a greater way not this formulated is the famous saying it's very popular in India brahma satyam jagat mithya rahman alone is real the world is false and UD Jeeva Jeeva may even happen you are none other than ground in terms of our diagram what does it mean Rama is the only reality so rest of it is the story Brahma is the only reality why are you doing this to me because your questions if you were completely satisfied in this democracy so now this is the only reality and this is the story from mine alone is being the world check out the work what what is bombs and you the Jiva you are none of them you might say but didn't you so I'm going to just say this such a diamond that through my ID shuara such another through of India Jeeva such another through brevity is German so in one sense Derek is also satchitananda you are also searching on anonymity sure you shouldn't know so sensitive to true but here is something a secret of South and a spiritual practice it is not helpful to put it that way which way that the world is also relevant you see our real problem is we are engrossed in the world our attention needs to be taken away from the things of the five senses from the samsara there comes we have embraced the samsara and they are holding on tight to it for ages and ages for life after life we need to step back so the teaching is done in another way that what you consider to be real this world which is what you see around yourself and experience samsara is an appearance it's not real it's a snake the reality is the Rope the rope here such a nun and you what are you what are you it would be equally true to say you are also an appearance ultimately Brahman is real but it's not helpful to put it that way what's helpful you are actually Brown so your attention will go away from the world and you will look within and find that is too much if we have to do a test manager 3lauras really don't worry it's a story after all you can you can even always write in the test that since it's a story maybe see the objects that we are talking about this word that's called each other this world how does it come about through community and we will see in detail how it comes about us and through Maya this one through ignorance Jeeva so this is the triangle now without this I have seen without this formally today's rounds and Aloha is real the world is false and in fact I found another clever formulation more modern formulation somebody put it this way Brahman alone is real the word is false and the world is problem think about it nice Brahman is real world is false and the world is prominent why not is this where's my soul here you are here what we are trying what we are asking is where am I in this you are here you what you consider yourself but you experience yourself you know now this and what we're not just trying to tell you is you wanna see how do you go from here to here yes may not this answer is true knowledge through knowledge when you say through knowledge you're dropping an atom bomb like not worried or something disturbing our country so knowledge it's a tremendous thing to say if you say something is removed through knowledge this is a mistake it will move through knowledge moment you say something is removed to knowledge what is removed through knowledge ignorant and it's products by knowing the Rope the false snake is removed correct by knowing the rope the fast snake is removed the appearance of a snake is removed what does that mean it's never was a snake it was a rope all along you did not see a rope as a rope you saw a rope as a snake by ignorance of the rope and you made a mistake correct and only knowledge can correct that that mistake you can take a stick and drive away the best thing with a snake is not a reasoning if something is destroyed by Knology here is the here is the formula if something is destroyed by knowledge removed by knowledge canceled by knowledge that thing must be false I see it as it is and it's destroyed it must be false something that is real is never canceled by knowledge its offense I see this as a pen if if knowledge meant to cancel or destroy something and be terrible and whatever you see with it disappear immediately yeah I know this as a parent disappears no it does not disappear because it's really in him but if it's a sneezing it's a snake and you go and look closely and get knowledge about it and you see that it's a rope the snake is obtuse further complicating the package sometimes it may not disappear but you realize it to be false blue pillar in the sky Oh blue scarf but you need a little bit of physics and you realize it's an optical illusion because of the scattering of light and you realize it's not really blue no matter how far you go you won't get blue color in your hands or anything Southwest just Jets are not blue because they went through a blue sky I'm Stewie but after you realize it's not really blue when you look up there it still looks after realizing after getting knowledge it's not but what happens now what's the difference between the child seeing it is a blue sky and you see it as a blue sky you see the blue sky just like the child but you know it's the feeling it is no business there appears blue not at least interpret understand and the child might think it appears in two and it is blue the sky is blue roses are red the sky is good for them for the child both of them are correct but you know roses are red correct sky is blue appearance in the same way for an inviting person will this world continue to appear yes unless that person is in Samadhi in a completely withdrawn the mind into Samadhi otherwise all the time the world will continue to appear just like appearing to you but that person knows something that you do not know so nama Christmassy is Narayanan touch teenager and the river Ganges but also knows all of it is my Deva it's my divine mother living in all these ways so that's the knowledge of each Ramakrishna has and we see the same touch additional and Ganges and Marine unit and if you only could but we see that and we think that's it that's the truth but we do not know the reality be enacted so anyway the essence of Atlanta is that searching are disappearing as jihad jihad Ishwara but the way it is taught is word is false you are none other day brother Raman is the only reality the word is an appearance and you got under them wrong what about God you do not mention to you each one what do you think is issue enough possible it should realtor area here if you say I am none other than Brandon and what about he sure if you are none other than program man what about Carla garden also none other than Rama Swami of a senior panther for pardon he used to say that all these apply beyond a knowledge to yourself and devotion to God then he would say that but you fools you going on applying knowledge to God for this new God unreal and read Vedanta and love yourself I am here my food is real my rest is but my troubles of you know reverse it applied knowledge to yourself and and and devotion to God see another day there are novelists very staunch novelists who will dismiss the reality of God that's not a very same path to take Sri Ramakrishna's teacher totally was one such in Sri Lanka said let me go and ask mother of my mother when I should learn with aunt or not he thought he's talking about his own mother and he would make fun what are you doing going to the temples and that image and all here is Brahman he realized yourself is Brahman that city forget God that God business so that that's one kind of a don't think that's also can you find that sometimes I met a villain till very staunch novelist who chuckle man say ah sorry but I am happily teased and half an atheist in him he would say antastic heavy and happily teased what he meant was he does not believe in a separate guard with farm and you know whom you can pray to the only reality believes in the reality within the reality of all of this experience all right so what question yes so I mean when I told either that he was same Rama and selfish sir but not in the oberoth accepts yes all right is the service he asked your question so the question was all right now let's relax when we move far enough one of the principles of teaching Vedanta here is [Music] Sanskrit alfarache a mockery which means small progresses is good too much information that they call it these days so that might be overwhelming so better progress is little progress and actually I am moving much faster than we usually do tomorrow what I will do is instead of taking up one person at a time you won't have to repeat it I haven't read up in entire sections and give you this summary so one person tank they have no time for that because the holes to get 65 versus the in-between section the story section I think there you in brief because it's a story after all then they get down to the actual teaching remember everything is over but now it's they're taking it leisurely to tell you a big story about it making a big big thing about it all right now here is a question Sri Ramakrishna is to say the he who was wrong incarnation of Vishnu he who was Krishna incarnation is the same in this body as a roundish 'no but not in your dynamic sense what does he mean he is talking in a sense of dualistic religions conventional religion all Hindus believe God incarnate Christians also believe not in college but Christians believe in one incarnation of God Jesus in those believes that it can happen again and again and again and it has happened in the past it has happened in different parts of the world it will happen again in the future so there is God you know if you you know what's the difference between dualistic religion and not we listen if you take this as a final truth and remove this you get to resist I am here we are all the givers here is a word and there is a God which we believe in until you see such a rod that's it finished is illyrian guess is the word real yes is God really yes what much more beyond that nothing that's it that's it that's dualistic religion non-dualism doesn't deny any of it but say that there is a higher reality behind all of it all of this is the appearance of one reality and normally exist it is insist that Brahman is also at the level of appearance without the constant relative reality Advaita Vedanta does not deny anything should I study science of course can we discover things in science which are valued of course because they are all working accurately with religious Jana what the word yes which are should I worship God and believe in God and perform a puja go to the temple as long as you think of yourself as this one signal it could be all these having a display this is the world of your religion and faith and belief this is the word of your empirical existence science and commerce and art and society yes without cigarette in it do all of that but what we are really teaches is find out what all these are in reality that alone will free you otherwise this cycle will continue forever as long as you want me to go on merrily the game of hide and seek God hiding himself as far as decided to be not God and does this you must find yourself always find yourself out now your question was what did Ramakrishna say now I wish to say there is one and God comes once in a while in the world as an incarnation his common and it's not official but not in your main Arctic sense why not because in your romantic sense all of this is such a gondola so everybody get is such an island everybody's an avatar the end and the puppy and the dog and the treaty and and the birds and every man woman and child everybody even the worst of people tell all you are all incarnations in that sense right so that's why he said not in your Vedantic sense not in that sense what he means is really the sense of dualistic religion there is God and there is an incarnation of God other questions and coronary questions that he is in my evidence the result did not what will have it and he made your film death so the story is referring to the question is this is that in Mohammed even Swami Vivekananda established the Advaita Shah he writes in a letter to attend yourself in McLeod or overseer I tell Christine that I have established these two places one up in the Himalayas for the practice of non-dualism no ritual snow worship nothing good not without and one on the bank of the Ganges he needs below once the main ministry where there we alleged the usual Hindu worship and all kinds of dualistic practices for shape and Hinton's and festivals and things like that and then he says let's see how it goes so once when he went to my ality it's in the human Himalayas it's a place somewhat like this a little higher up not very high up about 4,000 feet of 5050 it's what's called the gargoyle range many of you may have read the thrilling stories of gym carpet and hunting Tigers yeah that's way did it jump off a 12-8 so the big Tigers is too big cat ceased to be there at that time even now there are but smaller ones now when suddenly the Vaikuntha went there he saw a picture of Sri Ramakrishna worship going on merrily and he said the old man has entered here also then world is her oyster cbs13 back to the ship ever man is hitting the head so what is here also remove his picture and the picture was removed but the month was hurt if an sentimental party so he wrote to the Holy Mother Raja Raja Fayad Naren Vivekananda has said that should be removed what's wrong in worshiping ramakrishna and he thought that of course the believers is going to support me I'm Marcia pete sri ramakrishna geoVISTA everybody to urge its adoption and to his great surprise and shock although he was not just the opposite she said your guru Ramakrishna was non-dual very pristine use of birds not non-dualistic was not your meaning was Brahman and therefore I can say with all conviction that you are all not delicious what America and the Narayan did was absolutely right [Music] questioner other questions we have time I'm going to take it sure I'm a promise but will you be able to hear the will it require equipment illogical check it out it must be the ROM now which is versatile random they have it once every format yes and villagers are invited and people come from outside yes it must be Tirana because you can see the picture of Rama there and a little singing is there yeah that was instituted later on I think maybe but the benefit of the local villages correct I didn't complete the start thank you pure consciousness plus Maya is God with all our benevolent qualities when we think of God in any religion and you think of God what do you think about that all-powerful all-loving you know just and good and kind all types of nice qualities all those qualities come because of Maya the pure principle existence nauseous this is now the god of religion through mine but in reality who is who is God in reality sanchita who are you in reality that individual be who are you idiot subsidized in that sense alone you can say I have one that come but on this side of Maya we are individuals and God is God there is a huge difference this person has can you give me spirituality in one sentence and sri ramakrishna replied yes what is that one sentence Brahman is real the world is false assimilate this this is what he said and so I mean from an under takes care to point out saying this he kept quiet so now I'm just a kept quiet emphasizing that's all that has to be said he didn't even say that you are wrong he just said ramen is real tour de spots that's it assimilate district remember yes yes right everything is that you done and done it's like this and that you realize all of the waves in that lake out there to be water you recognize the ornaments they're all they look different there are different names something is called a necklace something is called a bangle something is called a ring but they are all so see everything is Brandon that is the result of Brahma John but I'll take you one step forward everything is Brahman is giving concession to the fact that there is everything from the point of view of everything if you say everything is brown when you say brother one is all-pervading you're accepting space and then we're all our space pervaded by ground when you say brahma is eternal you know accepting time that's why this thing Bronwen is done in the last two our time but really really speaking none of these statements are finally correct the truth is PR brahman is all-pervasive the truth is PR Brahman is eternal the truth is beyond Brahman is everything because actually ultimately space time and everything these are all products of Maya I come to you yes you see the person as an appearance remember who is an appearance this person who is thinking of himself as an individual being this man who is seeking enlightenment studying Vedanta meditating trying different ways big different things in the world and now as a spiritual seeker this business this person this is also a product of mine we can walk to this door and you see yourself as this this person will still continue to here it is to continue to appear but this is what others will call Jeevan Mukta liberated while living you from inside you you will not consider yourself achieve and moved on even consider yourself as Brahman that person all of us people we will admire and worship and love that personality remover but from your point of view you are not that person also one way of putting this is the person will not attain freedom ever you become free of the person I see your butt resented that this book is separate this once once is a decision system yes once a second that there was somebody was praising him oh the Bramha Gyan a you are a Brahmin kyani Norman he was a rock man actually he thought but saying you're insulting me what insulting is the highest praise that we can give in our culture you are nowhere up from he said I am from anybody who say this in order for admin is not an order problems anybody who says that Brahman cannot be known as an object is an order from inkay no venetian yes sir Madame Tessier madam madam is elevated at Baylor sir I mean Gotham Jonathan with Gotham of ajanta the one who says I know Brahman as an object would who holds this view does not know I have realized promenade and order of Robin does not know the one who says it cannot be knowing that way I am run the reality that person has the right view or it is not known to those who played to know it it is known to those who claim not to know it but not to know it is in the sense of enlightened person many others know Java is in space-time space-time in fact one definition of Maya some equivalent acacia Shankara gives it strangely enough later on can't he also talks about the categories of experience space-time caused Egyptian yes we make on the states the infinity absolute seen through the lens the lens of space in our world we are standing here trying to understand such a table what we're not just trying to convince assist you are already dis don't try to go from here to here right see that this and all this yes no it's an important question I will make a few remarks about it limited but you to think she said a couple of things he said in the beginning of the universe space-time reduces to a see here and now that's what he he mentioned okay let me make remarks on two points beginning and see these two words we speak about beginnings and ends accepting time reality of time we speak about here and there excepting space so just as it was the question is asked that to ask the question why is this universe here Vedanta will will say that this universe is not actually here Bramha appears as this universe because of mine that's the nuanced answer but if you're like a little child children have this knack of asking why so you can be even they're all shaken ask why Naya Brahmin could have remained is from sanchita of the pit of despair all this trouble so why Maya even if you say it's an appearance it's not real no real universe no real universe to be explained just ten appearance just the story as you were telling me fine even if it's a story it's an appearance but there also I can ask why and Vivekananda in the Vedanta literature you find the answer to this question is strange they say the question is wrong or they seem to obfuscate stop you there you can't ask this why if you ask that also why why can't asking I'm asking why why am i I thought it took me some time to understand what they are saying but we record you said why is the question well why can't you ask this is very interesting Maya I space-time cross-section right space hi this is mine now when you ask to see let's take two in fact this what we're seeing with why admire this question you cannot ask this question why hire it's a wrong question what why is this wrong question and Pregnant's on this it's like trying to ask suppose you ask what is outside space a child who's reading physics may try to and ask them to childish question but itself then it will feel like that what is OK space is circular it's enclosed with universes there so what is outside it the manager will be see even the question of inside and outside is assuming space the whole question of inside and outside you know already assuming space and then only you can ask inside and outside you cannot ask for a space outside space that's also space in that case so outside space this question does not make sense are you with me similarly time what was there before the beginning of time this position also doesn't make sense Wyatt because before and after you're already assuming time if wolf concept of sequence temporal sequence before and after past present and future you're already auditioning time if you say before time it can be due before time because before and after will begin only with time so you cannot ask the question before time are you all right now look at causation keep that in mind in direct causation what is causation causation is causing effect that's published why is the grass wet you will say because it rained why did it rain because in the clouds why then they're clouds because the water vapor was collected by the Sun and look what is the question you are asking why when you ask why what are you doing you are asking for the cause of an effect you see an effect against what right so when you ask why you are already assuming cousin in it will very question my assumes cause and effect they must get cause to it that's what you're asking forgive me across but mana itself is a static position before Maya there's no causation you cannot ask why let me repeat this understand exhaust water Maya if that's why Maya and that sir is the question is not what I have always used to think why is it wasted why like why didn't you might want to ask why because it's just like trying to ask outside space but outside it's a big sense to me concept of spaces before time what was there before time began before and have to make sense of even timelessness similarly why makes sense only then causation is dead when causation is there in the universe you can ask any model you may not get answer but it's a legitimate question to ask but before causation no Y can be asked because the whole thing about why cause and effect starts with - so why causation is like asking why by wrong question you cannot ask to stop just wait with this you see it will make sense to you if you intensely think about these things and we struggle with it and then you make this breakthrough it makes a great deal of sense if I present it to you before you have added up quite question itself then it doesn't make much sense answer makes sense only when you have the question answer to your question is does the blueness of the sky disappear when you realize the sky is not blue answer what is the answer yes yes in what sense you realize there is no real Loomis there then no blueness at all Judas is gone no goodness how will you remove that luminous through knowledge you didn't scrub it through knowledge you removed a false blueness but but but as long as your eyes and you look up into the daytime sky what will it look like but you know because I think you know that it's an appearance it's not really blue out there in the same way when you experience the world experience the word is always within mind so for you Maya will continue to appear what what will happen is at that point when you are enlightened and you know Grundmann when you realize that your problem in your enlightened state you are you are entitled to call all this mile for us to call this Maya right now is there given we haveá-- read something clever and heard a lecture and a colleague admire but for you it will be a fact it is an appearance just like if you if I can say standing here looking at the deep blue sky with all honesty and conviction I can say there is not an interview out there and you would say yes because both you and I only know the truth in the same way the enlightened person can say and quizzing here is such it another is no man no woman no misery no suffering no planets and stars atoms and quartz no it is one existence consciousness twist and the rest of it is a projection of mine now does Maya exist no does it not exist no in fact the definition of Maya you read that way the text books son Asad young Anil Virginia which cannot be definitely said to or not to be if it is that you cannot remove it by knowledge remember what I said what is real cannot be removed by knowledge only one is unrelated can be removed by knowledge false appearance can be removed by knowledge there is no real blue over there once you read a physics textbook the blueness loses its reality for you all right but you cannot say it is not but because after all Maya is what gives you this experience Brahman is experienced in fact brandman can experience itself only because of my Brahman is experiencing itself as a person as the treatise in the sky in the lake as happiness and missile against bondage and liberation all of it is mine I want to make one comment a very conscious last question there but a comment about the second thing I promise to use the word seed he used a word seed I see is brother he's brown when the seed of his universe what I mean is there is a seed and it has to potentially be always to sprout right I see no sprouts and it becomes a tree and it gives rise to other seeds and it dies and other seeds comprise too far the trees and so on I'll finish I'll be quick supper it's like Pavlov's bells is Brahman the seed of this universe from Ram Mohan the universe is created in Brahman the universe exists in two rather than the universe disappears a few things like that virtual but I see has the potentiality of generating a sprout a seed changes into the tree and has the potential of generating future seeds and it goes in cycles like that seed sprout tree that tree more seeds and so on it changes is Brahman like that you know Brahman is not the seed of this universe Bronwen with Maya is the seed of this universe but as we said Maya's not really so Brahman is not really the seed of this universe there is there is an appearance a cycle which goes on and on and on but it's an appearance destruction creation existence of the universe destruction again waking dreaming deep sleep waking again but all through that the reality is one existence consciousness bliss that's what we're not this pointing towards where darkness is conventional religion says God is a seed where doctor says it's just an appearance it's not really a seed last question we'll hear the question let's see if this time yeah yes linguistic observe ontologically absurd and illogical as being if you if you posit us an infinite regress of causes then you're multiplying beings without end yes radiation releases and infinitum so that's also one reason why there must be a stop to that that thing but the reason I show it was actually a very romantic reason but my self is causation before causation you can't ask why if you look at the overlap even the language I'm using before after here and there yeah so all our language depends on space-time and causation we cannot get out of this language if it's called tensed language take it in the sense of past present and future like it is designed that language is designed for to a little impact in one of the verses in our chapter with your NSA's questions and answers are always in duality in non duality there is no question of no extra person Oh John this sunday sunday [Music] you
