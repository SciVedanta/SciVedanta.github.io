[Panchadasi - Lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNcrtQzutTg)

[Music] they lead us from darkness into light leaders from death to immortality Oh this morning session is the most important of all the sessions that will do this sentence if there's one single class where you really need to be able to speak since this one why because in this morning session I will take up the introductory part of chapter 1 of pancetta she wear with the Irenaeus wha me the author does something remarkable what does he do using only logic only reasoning and experience he proves to us that we are existence consciousness bliss Brandon what is that remarkable in the path of devotion bhakti for example you are asked to believe most conventional religion believed that there is something called God and have faith and surrender and love and worship and adore and you will get the results if not in this life after death that is the path the central thing is belief in the fact of yoga meditation you're not a believe as such do these exercises meditation techniques and then we get experience what experience extraordinary experience this is our inner experience you see and hear and smell and touch and think and remember and desire this ordinary experience this experience of life which we have now but in yoga Patanjali yoga promises you extraordinary experience if there is a God we must see God if there is an immortal soul I must actually experience it so there an experience extraordinary experiences will come through Patanjali yoga by these techniques of meditation distinguished from the path of belief from the kata extraordinary experience is this path of knowledge where the Google is not the dollar has not bleep even asked to believe and have faith you are not even asked to do certain set of exercises to get extraordinary experiences no what you're asked to do is listen to these teachings and see for yourself it's a fact of insight not in play start in early experiences all you need is the ordinary experience of living noting that the DRAM you and speak about here is beyond your experience of my experience it's always in our daily experience we all have it all the time he will just point out something that we never noticed never understood never saw before so this is the path of insight and of belief rather extraordinary experience panel insight insight into what insight into already what is there and it should be possible in presently there is all the time eternal must be now if feminine is only present everywhere must be here if Brahman is non dual then none will needs no second taking apart from Rama Rama is non dual then nothing here is apart from German if that is so then it's something that is continuously available to us and yet why do we not see it when we not experience it be witnesses it is possible you can actually you can into actually experience is not quite the right word you can realize it as a fact of your life right now and that's what he is trying to do in just eight verses which we will do today in this session now the session is structured in three to three parts in the first part the author will prove to us show to us that we are infinite consciousness the Sanskrit word is  that's the first part then have to stop and take a couple of questions if you have anything to say so all your questions above this till the end of the first part the second part is we're even sure to has many an infinite existence suck are we right now as an accomplished fact that we are in mortal spirit infinite existence that will be the second part - they'll stop if you have any questions one or two questions then we will go on to the third part Ananda where we will prove to us that we are permanent and highest source of joy the art on the self we are already under the nature of bliss itself again proving it up to us through reason and based on our experience already existing experience then I stopped again and take a final couple of questions so that's what we're going to do verse number three this is where it begins today we are going to do this morning we are going to do verses 3 to 10 please repeat after me [Music] [Music] if this talk is first taught is the most important of all the talks then this particular verse is the most important of all horses is / this one number 3 all the rest that we will do in the next few days very interesting I'm going the philosophy of knowledge will be done very interesting but this verse is your don't lead to enlightenment I'm not exaggerating one bit focus on this verse what does it say stage 1 stage 2 do I get it understand it stage 3 most important is it real is it a fact are they telling him practice like there's a lake and sunshine sunshine outside it's a fact not Theory not speculation not philosophy in the same way what we're going to do now is it a fact if it is a fact don't to enlightenment is open for you it's not a fact if you keep on nothing until the door opens the enough of Hearts in now let's see what does this first stage it says and when you woke up in the morning you saw so many things in you guys open the new so so many things you heard so many things and that we came for breakfast and you smell the coffee and you tasted the bread and so many things to see you all all throughout the day from waking up till now we have been hearing things we've been smelling things we have been tasting things touching and seeing for sound smell taste touch so many of these things streaming into us we have been having many experiences now he the author draws our attention to the very nature of experience what an experience it is using awareness and an object of your awareness coming together every discussion the consciousness sentient whatever you commit that one plus an object coming together generates and experience example you are looking here is an object a pen now on you are having the experience of seeing a pen what happened you near airiness and this object of course in between there is the light bunches of this object goes to your eyes and the optical nerves transmitted to the brain the brain somehow presents it to the mind in the mind percept is generated on the form of the pen and you have the experience of a pen I'm reading out the process in between the process is here it is physical light surface when it goes into your eyes optical it becomes biological after that goes through your nervous system into the brain valentin neuroscience will study that our to die somehow we don't we hit modern science is no clue how does something biological get transformed into something psychological this is what is called a hard problem of consciousness a lot of work is going on on this field right now anyway I'm not going to that one of my favorite subjects if I start on that how does something bad algae cut something physical physical and biological you can understand we understand the mechanism because violence is also part of the physical universe but something biological context it becomes psychological do you understand the biological becoming psychological optical nerve the nerves brain all biological but then next what happens miracle you see the pain it's in your mind your mind becomes active consciousness and mind you have the experience of seeing a pain what are the experience you sing of in the awareness within you you're aware of the vision your seat up in this step just as an aside I saw this discussion where they're talking about how does something physical and biological become psychological and conscious and there's a cartoon scientist has is deriving a result step one step two step three step four Step five so one full of calculations - is full of calculations forest full of calculations and is full of calculations but step 3 just written correctly and uh and the professor is telling the student who's written this I think you need to work on step 3 any side so you have the person experience is consciousness plus object or consciousness in between all the physics biology and basically your awareness and you are aware of something right that leads to experience consciousness plus object is equal to the speed consciousness was object of experience is equal to experience okay so far that's the very very structure of experience that structure of experience now what is pointing out is the objects of consciousness are many imagine how many things you've seen since the morning and how many things are you seeing right now there are all objects how many serious heard and how many things you're hearing right now there are objects so the objects what you are aware of those things are many number one but you the awareness you're not being number same awareness awareness plus an object leads to an experience awareness or consciousness plus is of this one - this is experience one you have experience - and then object 3 you have a series of experiences the experiences are different from each other because the objects of experience are different from each other but the awareness is the same the same awareness same consciousness humans different objects the objects of experience keep changing the awareness reaches which is aware of these objects does not change the objects of experience and many the awareness is not many the objects of experience and different from each other the images which is aware of each of these different objects is not different is what I have said a number of things should I think I will illustrate with examples the objects of awareness are many here is one object of evidence here is another object of awareness here is another object of awareness some another object of awareness touch the table in front of you another object of awareness so the objects of awareness are all are many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and these objects are different from each other isn't it and a different look to objects ok and the objects of evanesce keep changing here 1 2 3 continuously changing hence because the objects of awareness of many we have many experiences because the objects of awareness are different from each other there are different experiences the experience of drinking orange juice and red beans of drinking lemonade are different the different why because orange juice and lemonade are different the awareness issues and they are orange juice and lemon the same events so the objects are different and the experiences are different objects are many experiences are many objects keep changing and experiences keep changing many experiences different experiences changing experiences all because the objects are many different and changing but the awareness of them say mmm is not a pen the same awareness tommy book same mmm is currently sound is also changes and sometimes unhappy sometimes understand happy inside the states of the mind there are all subjects these are physical objects mind mental objects you remember your name that's one you're remembering a world you remember what you look like in the mirror you remember in the form two memories so two experiences their memories are also objects thoughts and also objects emotions are also objects designers are also objects so Tara metal objects they also give rise to experiences mental experiences but the heaviness is one and the same this is all that they're pointing out very important look at the verse shoved especially Aradia the objects of experience shutter sound special touch re etc what is etc sight taste smell and inside your mind memories thoughts ideas feelings desires these are all great Chitra they are all different there's a variety return they are all separate from each other when in your waking State after they wake up from sleep in the morning what you see along with the experience around you talked about they marked an important point about all these objects different from these objects is the consciousness different from the objects in the consciousness and one point that we are going to move and say that the consciousness is not different from reason all these objects are not different with the consciousness but for the time being we are going to say that apart from these objects is the awareness apart from what you experience is your awareness which experiences and that awareness which is different from the objects of experience that awareness is it one harmony I need you to be confident on this one why is it changing and unchanging and unchanging how can you say that your consciousness is unchanging aren't you Bryant and making after a cup of coffee aren't you dull and sleepy after away down the class aren't you angry sometimes aren't you peaceful sometimes so how can you see your consciousness is unchanging answer that there are mental states your consciousness is that which is aware of those mental states also the mental states keep changing yes we are making a distinction between mental states and consciousness so it is one an unchanging and not different from experience to experience experiences are many why are experiences many because objects of experience and many experiences keep changing why do you experience changing because objects of experience keep changing experiences a different religion each experience differs from the other the experience are prevent / differs from the experience of Lully why not because their level is different it's because Vancouver is different from Lublin the objects are different hence the experiences are different in our waking state we have a series of experiences in fact what is making accept a series of experiences those experiences are dead due to the different objects of experience but apart from the objects of experience is the consciousness not something the word used for consciousness the special word used by the theology for some it means awareness it's exactly cheap don't get too hung up on these words they all yeah I will miss consciousness sentient what an account remember we are talking about something that is so telling here you're not talking about something extraordinary what about whether I experienced some of it wherever and when my Kundalini will be awakened and then I will experience some with no no I mean listening to my words now did you taste the coffee in the morning yes there is some bit the company's not some with my words are not some with time it's experience the coffee and my words that some it damn submit is one unchanging and different from the objects of experience one unchanging and different from the objects of experience that's all that has been said here stage one do you not have a basic idea of what was said here it's in the diner Stage two do I get it questions so I'll come to it later we're going to go through a few more verses then I finished stage one I'm going to even have questions and stage three is it a fact think about what was said here is it a fact you just ponder on that thing is it a fact is it something that they say if it is so all we need revolutionizes what we thought about ourselves Who am I can't you see me Here I am but no if you if you follow that then this which I am showing this body it's also an object and I have this some width consciousness which is aware of this object that's not not normally how we think of ourselves we think of ourselves as here this month now if you say this immediately the question will be are you aware of this I have to say you're aware when I can see it and feel it if you are aware of it it's an object you are that which is aware you're not that if you are aware of and say the art which is aware of the Sun which is different from the object of awareness if the body is an object of awareness then it then the incredible conclusion is just as this pin I never said I am the thing I see I am aware of the technical see the penny train Allah tells me there is no basically in principle this between this as an object of your awareness and this body which is an object of innovation which is already a huge huge step if you have lied to your mind even more incredible and so miserable are you aware of the misery yes of course in that case it's an object and used his son with the consciousness you must be different from the misery in your mind hence you cannot be miserable when Arthur insists not only is it clever but it's also very much a fact now all we have to do is to see it and I guarantee the moment you see it to the extent that you see it you will be free of depression and it also be free of pleasure and excitement but it does not mean that you will not experience pleasure and excitement you will continue to experience pleasure and excitement you continue to experience depression also and yet you will see I am not depressed or I am NOT X excited and the light which shines upon the excitement or depression in my mind think about it since the morning till now how many times before remind me have we been displeased or irritated how many times have we been pleased and peaceful all come and gone and more - coming from throughout our days and nights and our months and years so many such experiences will keep coming and going so many little pleasures and so many raishin so many little unhappiness some so many little happinesses all objects you the awareness a different from them and as they come and go they give you experiences of pleasure and pain and depression and peace that all may worked out some with a very different from them I'll include the odd it is one and the same wherever evidence is one and the same nothing dirty it does not differ the objects different the objects change the objects are many the awareness does not differ throughout our experiences one golden thread drugs to the experiences of all your life it does not differ it does not change it is not many it's one as they fade tonight and darkness descends upon the lake before asleep and perhaps dream between let's go to verse number four stars of nasty room job a theorem that they don't astraios [Music] and so we fall asleep and when we dream at night we forget that we are the body is on the bed sound asleep but what do you experience we experience other times and other places and other people are all imagined in the might it's produced to him exiting on the front of a TV and watching a TV show it's produced in the mind but it seems to be very real in a dream we don't think that oh I'm seeing a nice movie produced by my mind no you think this actually happened all sorts of funny things start happening and dreams and making we take them to be different are they really different and fast we're on the would say no but beginners Vedanta would say okay you think they're different most grown-up people be distinguish between adults distinguish between dream I'm waking you to distinguish yes very good we take it let them be different there is if you go to advance lay down under pure position they say there are not three stages waking dreaming and deep sleep normally minami we speak about breaking breathing in deep sleep and we shall speak about it now monitor your condition will say there are only two stages what are the two stages dreams and see me dreams are up two times dreams and waking waking is also a dream a dream is also watching and we sleep anyway we are not going into that we are taking some a common-sense approach since you feel that you're making and your dream are different there are two different things dreams are just free is real or the other things things we feel and we Dundas it okay I'd sign up on that now how are the ringing and the dreams different many ways you might say dreams are not real if I if I have one cookie now and three in my dreams I don't say awkward at all cookies if I'm having a pizza in my dream and I eat one slice and it's time to wake up I don't say let me put it in the fridge I'll come back to the next treatment in the tournament no because you do not take you do not take the objects of being to be real like like making baking easily and it really is just doing that what we say so that is what he says the objects objects the objects of dream are not stable they're not really real whereas the objects of waking are stable still on the word still emits they stable when you wake up pretty good go to where you park your car outside next bonding and you may know it's there unlike the green pizza would be there but the car is there it's still what you left with any cover when you fell asleep when you wake up again you get the same word that more or less so they're stable but that's not the point what's the point the point is redonda is not interested in your dreams where Arthur is interested in the dreamer wadn't is not interested in the objects of consciousness what is we're not interested in consciousness here not here our entire attention of the world and all of us are tired [Music] not this way here lies some sorry here lies motion a Swami once said to the person game of the Swami was narrating his woes and the Swami said I am NOT interested in your problems the person was shot a crib and not interested in your problems uninterested in you you see now what are the problems here I'm interested in you not those things so here the point is we are not interested in what you dreamt about we are interested in the consciousness to which the dreams are here so the awareness which dreamt of the objects in the dream that is is one unchanging awareness the objects in the dream are many they come and go and yes they are different from the waking state if you insist but I am NOT interested in that I am interested in that ma is the one hunting awareness which in whose light you have those dreams that awareness continues is the same awareness which was there in the waking State it's the same awareness which is there in the dream state drag which illumined your waking state now see when you fall asleep and you have dreams it's the same event is which continues to light up your dreams and where it is at apart from the objects of your waking state it is also a part from the objects of your dream state and the objects of the waking state commando the objects of the dream state also come and go faster and as the objects of the nation state are different from each other the objects of the dream state are also different from but one shred of consciousness runs through all of that all right that's the dream for Fort Worth some which continues to drink some some with a guru Poornima theory that one unchanging consciousness continues in green moss it's bi-rite life that you get dream experiences what happens up to dream what happens after REM sleep we have heard of REM sleep non REM sleep so we go into deep sleep God so should do deep sleep where it is not dream you're neither awake nor any dreaming what you experience if no objects of experience of all the objects are right up all the objects are removed of blackness so consciousness according to Vedanta consciousness continues in deep sleep our normal reaction to deep sleep is you know how we understand deep sleep we understand needlessly by all the objects are there the waking world is there but my consciousness is gonna go so I will not experience anything after what is experience consciousness plus object is equal to experience our normal understanding is objects are there I am lost consciousness so I'm not getting in experience and that's deep sleep that's anesthesia that's being unconscious even the word we use unconscious where none exists it's just the opposite consciousness continues but there are no objects to experience because the body is asleep the senses are not getting objects the mind is asleep so there are no trees the gateways of the objects the senses have been shut down because they're sleeping the mind which generate streams shut down no mental objects no physical objects hence the objects are not available to consciousness hence you do not get experience experience requires two things consciousness plus object if you move object you will get lack of experience of objects in phantom Armada notices is that in the place of all the objects desert blankness there is a not knowingness and consciousness shines upon that not knowingness hence when you wake up you have a feeling and I slept deeply I slept like a log I did not know anything I did not know anything I slept like a log home you know that our Norman idea of deep sleep is it's a matter sense of experience Vedanta says it's not enough sense of experience it's an experience of accents through it can you prove it one way or the other where are the claims that yes we can if it was an absence of experience no experience waking dreaming and deep sleep is not an experience there's no experience there if you say that then you know what what would happen when you wake up you would say I reserved a knee I went to pain and higher trees and I'm awakening but we don't do that we say I was amazing I went to bed I had dreams and there are minutes of complete blindness and I'm awake periods of complete length as hobbies know that it's also an experience because consciousness can you make this important consciousness can you mean the objects of experience and consciousness can be using the absence of objects of experience I am seeing you now my eyes are open if I close my eyes we normally see I am not seeing which also ii am and seeing blackness of darkness seeing never ceases actually right now if you blink your eyes you close your eyes you will see a darkness that's what you see you've seen the absence of objects so deep sleep is also an experience it's an experience of absence consciousness [Music] don't eat us here after waking up from each sleep we have the recollection there was a period of blindness Damo boredom and an experience of absence and experience of nothing an experience of darkness we have that kind of recollection now you cannot have an election without a prior experience so Santa a la derecha every kind of ventilation is always of some experience in the past recollection is of some experience in the past so in deep sleep you must have experienced blackness it was not an absence of experience it was an experience of absence which means the point being in deep sleep also consciousness continues verse number six so wish I didn't know wish I didn't know sonica some Victor Puente countries they did and the consciousness that it is different from the blackness which it experiences just like this consciousness is different from the objects of the waking State this consciousness is difference of the objects of the dream state this consciousness continues to be different from the blackness of deep sleep state and hence they own star trade vehicle in all the three stages waking dreaming and deep sleep there is one unbroken unchanging consciousness called submit this engineering consciousness which experiences waiting body external world and mind which experienced dreaming in the mind experiences blackness in deep sleep that unchanging consciousness this is the story of one day from linking to dreaming to deep sleep one day next history dr. Dean Arthur a same story and the day after night same story waking dreaming sleep and then the week after that same month after night year after - same same stories making breathing sleeping series of experiences that's what's happening the next verse the seventh first which is where Adam stop the seventh verse is a very powerful verse very poetic very dry and verse it draws a conclusion from what we are made of doing so far what's the conclusion the page the issue of emission economy gonna know the in a stomachache iike some with a Sheboygan problem beautiful first this sun-baked consciousness so I am umbrella self-effulgent self-effulgent means just like everything in the room is dark and cannot reveal itself which is which on the light the light reveals everything in the room and the light what do you need to reduce the light nothing else lightly beats itself you don't need to switch on another light similarly consciousness is that which reveals everything in the universe and itself at the same time so I am trauma self-effulgent what does it say about it days passed months pass massive it's months months pass one consciousness the objects keep tainted waking dreaming deep sleep the you the consciousness unchanging important unchanging as the months facts the years rolled by after these years and then over the years and the body changes and pages death might come to the body the consciousness remains unaffected they are audio questions you can ask after this consciousness remains completely unaffected you cannot be honest mimics many bodies may come and many parties may go many diminutive masses at the Sun built across our sky these days and nights kalayavana to another objects of consciousness keep changing the consciousness is one and unchanging he across yawns across cycles of time confer Hindus have very huge scales of time millions of years hundreds of millions of years so across over shootings of time one an unchanging consciousness gotta be shot another many engines and eons have linear eons have passed many more yet will tax consciousness remains one and unchanging no they didn't ask the maybe this is some non consciousness it like compared to a son which need arises not sense who daily brightness as committee since it neither increases nor decreases neither Rises not set what not the Sun you the consciousness rising and setting needs pertinent there is no point for you the consciousness there is no death for you see consciousness but endeavor for the body so this immortal unchanging consciousness you are and I am and all of us are this is what we are this is the thesis I have included the first part chip three stages what was said state 1 no meaning region itself just to take the sisters argument we went through now stage 2 do I get it this is where the question should be and stage 3 is it a fact is it real questions please raise your hand so Mara did the consciousness is always there when a child is born he still has the consciousness but how look at the language the language the question was if consciousness is always there in a Chinese board does he still have the consciousness yes this is the question look at the language of the question child is born what is born body when he asked does he still have a consciousness what you're basically asking does that body still have consciousness you're still thinking of the body and having consciousness without the reverse is it look at your own case is it true that you are a body with consciousness or a consciousness aware of body where is the money let me answer your question do you experience your own body do you see it do you feel it is the body and experience yes right nobody doubts that the body clearly spin if nothing else actually it is the body now experiences always consciousness plus object is the body and object of consciousness but is an object of consciousness you see you touch it you feel it don't take a bath for two days you smell it so the body's definitely an object of consciousness does it change from childhood Tilda yes yes it differs changes continuously it's a changing object of consciousness you are the consciousness now you rephrase your question in the light of this and the question will be I saw the birth of the bottom definitely used on the part of the body in your awareness in your consciousness please their awareness they're also quite possible you did not see the creation of consciousness you saw the creation of a bar question yes I have a sense that it's not right it's a very question and a powerful question look at the immediately put there what can you experience objects when an object comes in rather consciousness you have an experience so what are you expediency an object right in every experience is an object so is consciousness an object numb consciousness is the pure subject what you truly are what do you think that your subject is that an impure subject yes it's when we add our objects to consciousness that the subject becomes in view the real subject is this summit and we have objects we what do you need an optics to it when I say I am standing here I then what I'm doing is I'm adding the body to the consciousness my conscious this plus body I'm standing here when I say I agree a hundred and fifty pounds I am NOT saying consciousness be hundred fifty pounds I'm saying consciousness aware of an object or the body which weighs 130 pass correct so Vaseline in your subject with a pure subject is consciousness itself you what you truly are listening we'll come to it so what can you do what you truly are remember the what we're doing here is a very rigorous exercise we are not importing concept we are being very we are being very loyal to our experience the more you stick to the truth should be truth of your experience the more you leave our philosophy in words the more you will understand what he's trying to say he is very strictly very honestly very finely reporting your own experience Marie stick to that that advantage is the more you stick to your own experience and all this the more chances that there are of seeing the truth because he's seeing the truth and he's Republican - you just stick to your experience the moment you say Brahman has he used the word wrong what is the word wrong do you experience anything but rather than here stick to your experience otherwise you will float up on fantasies of you know theory and abstraction level which is all right but you miss in the human mind million lives stick to your experience as you're experiencing the universe right now you have a chance of enlightenment all right now I'm coming back to your question and answer that very sharply there can you experience consciousness we have already said not one thing we have already said consciousness is not an object clearly not it is the subject which shines upon the object and hence you cannot experience consciousness as an object but yes here's the interesting thing I just give you I think it's gonna be enough time for us to go through that here is the technique in any three experience what is experience a combination of the subject and the object consciousness plus object right so if you look at your experience it's two things it's you the consciousness plus an object in every experience because these two things are present not only the object of experience but the subject is also available I'm saying something's very very simple like our attention is so much on the object we've missed the subject if I show you this what will you say it is we'll see it's a pen I think no it's a pen plus light reflecting of a pen in fact only thing that is going into your eyes is the light reflecting of the pen the pen cannot blink your eyes you have to be rushed to the emergency room if it in your eyes are meant only for receiving light the million things that you see the ayah does not receive any one of them it just will receive the light reflected from them but we miss we forget the light you say this is a pen this is the magnet food is the man is a woman know all that you're actually physically receiving from the world outside in your eyes is light in the same way follow this carefully they predict that you experience as an object is shining in your consciousness otherwise you could not experience it so every experience is of an object shining in consciousness is this clear so that means every experience is consciousness plus object in every experience you the consciousness are being revealed not as an object as the subject of that experience let me give you some little little use application of this they say rehearsal the sacred secret this is a profound secret for example how do you use this in any free experience consciousness is I'm not saying experienced as an object it is revealed just like like the object shining in light every objective experience is shining in your consciousness hence whenever you experience something our tendency is to focus on the thing being experienced not on the experiencer right I'm seeing a pen my or my endowed focuses of the pen but can I use this pen to become aware of the fact that I have got eyes and my eyes are open to sit for meditation and the air conditioner fixing of is a door slamming and your normal reactions oh I want peace and cried and I want to meditate on the Atman and this slamming of the door in India there mosquito buzzing what would the way mount into the air conditioner kicks in the hum is revealed to me by me the consciousness that slamming of the door in a flash it reveals something - where is the slamming of the door except in your consciousness everything that happens in the world will be read to you deep your consciousness that you are some with without that you cannot experience even the most disturbing experience you have irritating experiences they are revealing to you that you are pure consciousness one and unchanging without this consciousness how you experience something irritated somebody you're good - I think and when I sit for meditation the factory horn sounds no oldies position shift changing of the shift in factory it would be a big it sounds it's so disturbing outside of you all the time [Music] as you see more so consciousness at least we're looking at that hearing it seems more intangible than awareness so what is the relationship between consciousness awareness and the sense of since the president said the five senses that we have are we perceiving are those Here I am NOT making a distinction between awareness consciousness sentient let's start with I mean I can make the distinction but in English the words are not resized in sanskrit the words are very precise meanings but I don't want you to go into that right now yes they are different pure consciousness very intangible there is an awareness that we feel in the mind right now it's more tangible and it becomes more tangible when we have sense experiences see touch smell taste so there are these conditions these conditions are called by the mind and the senses not because of your consciousness right so we just leave it at that but you just take awareness / consciousness / sense sentience in a broad sense and what you feel by which you leave the universe all the time available to you if you want to answer that question make a fine distinction which you should then from your sense of awareness remove any object that final object les Vegas is pure consciousness good stuff now I'll go to the next this thing has to be done at a stretch the next part no verse it's implicit in what has been done and give you the reasoning behind it what what are they trying to prove that this pure consciousness is also pure existence unchanging immortal existence undying uncreated existence son how do you prove that simple logic I've given to you see what you think about it it's implicit in this discussion he has not given separate verse for it our properties are invariably lost blue sky not blue at night it'll be dark in early morning Barozzi huge red now red and in darkness and gloominess are not the intrinsic property of the sky it's because of the play of light and the clouds and the moisture in the air you get different colors in the sky the sky accent has no color is it right not one thing that the different colors even the lake will have different colors depending on the light in the sky and the clouds in the sky mountain into different now these properties these colors have come into the sky and God one sign of but property is borrowed or not is it comes and goes anything that comes and goes is borrowed somebody said to these days you cannot recognize who's truly rich because everybody has got fancy gadgets and cars and clothes but a lot of it can be forever on one planet it's only when you see their house being repossessed or the car being taken away will be less oh not really really rich but it was a powerful thing it came and went it's borrowed so the sign of a borrowed property is that it comes and goes okay with me so far it would come back and go away now if you treat existence instance not a property but if you treat it temporarily as a property if existence is borrower then what will happen to the entity which borrows existence it will existence will come and move if it's about a property like money coming and going like the blue color coming and going so existence coming and goings existence coming and going is another very kind you're saying it will be barn and every time it will be creating to be destroyed so boggling existence we mean words creation coming into me losing existence death destruction losing our life now my question is if something does not if something does not have existence as a borrower property if it has existence as an intrinsic property intrinsic property I'll give you an example which will illustrate the difference when you buy a potato so the potato is hot or potato and in the put into is hot is they eat intrinsic to the property was it always about will tal is it me not know it's borrowed its heat from the boiling water after some time it is become golden you serve it on a plate the water is it always hot no it became hot because it borrowed its heat from the hot sauce man after some time to become cool again the saucepan is it always hot no it borrowed its heat from the fire beneath it after some German to become cool again the fire is it always hot mechanical summers Kingdom as long as the fire exists it's hot isn't it and now when the fire raises his heart because he is an intrinsic property in a common-sense way we say heat is an intrinsic property of mine fire doesn't have to follow him from anywhere else if neither borrows not loses heat as long as the fire is burning to be hot so this is the difference between a borrower Robert in intrinsic property now imagine if something that existence as an intrinsic property if something in existence is a bother to remedy it would be borrowed and at one time it would be created and destroyed if something has existence as an intrinsic property what would happen to it it would always be there and it would never come into being it will never go out of being it would never be born you never time would never be created not destroyed it will always be there that which is always there and unchangeably has existence as an intrinsic property repeating that which is always there must have existence as an intrinsic property not Paulo right what did we find just now some wait chit is always there in making and dreaming and deep sleep as the years of your life go by in like types at night times in here ons somewhere is always there neither bread neither rice is not sense so this always existing some of it must have existence as an intrinsic property which means this existence must be one and the same thing this is God's up your resistance some it is also because it exists all the time it does not borrow existence like borrowing heat like the protector borrowing heat it does not borrow existence existence is intrinsic to it this intrinsic inherent existence in philosophy becomes necessary existence this is God's act and this is sort of implicitly understood no person I will have any questions now and complete the island aspect and then we'll stop we have run out of time but I expected that but this thing has to be finished at one go it's like a performance you can't split up a musical piece in two pieces one performed at wonderful it's William remarkable performance by the GRT now he goes on he has to prove that this is your nature and this is going to do that first is going to prove that the self-pity you yourself are the source permanent source of happiness permanent source of happiness and the next personal group you be yourself the self Eden is the highest source of happiness dominant and my source of happiness I am my own permanent source of happiness how do you prove that all right the logic is like this from this is close they are beauty and it's a very interesting piece of luggage it goes like this whatever gives me happiness I like whatever gives me happiness whoever gives me happiness what action gives me job gives me happiness what place gives me happiness what food gives me happiness whatever it is I like what I like I try to keep trying to get it I try to keep it preserve it so the logic is like that happiness liking keeping or the other way around if I try to keep something it's because I like it if I like it it's because it's giving me happiness the reverse if there is something does not help me happiness makes me unhappy and don't like it it could be a person it could be a place it could be a food it could be anything I don't like it and that thing I do not like I try to catch it up I try to get rid of it I like this I own it's very it is making me happy so what happens I like it if I like it what do i do do I must purchase it I must have it happiness liking get it but then what happens they put up an advertisement iPhone 7 the new one immediately which was giving me happiness was I wanted I liked it and it kept it what happened now Apple is very clever they heated the root now it's making me unhappy because in comparison I shall respect the poor the same iPhone 6 now doesn't give me happiness because the new one is there the moment the same one does not give me happiness what is not in next I don't like it but that next replace it with it's an iPhone or a person or a job please whatever say she works all the time say it's like a goat is working this is the basic DNA of the way our likings the structure now but this is my respiration we apply it to yourself we never say let me not be we all they say let me be immediate question might be what about suicides but suicides those want to kill themselves the doubt will be they are thinking and let me not be isn't it let me not let me die it may not be but that's always because there's a problem in the word a financial problem a relationship problem or a disease or a mental problem something the moment you solve that problem the present doesn't want to die anymore I have an enormous debt I can't pay it off I'm going to shoot myself maybe we'll pay it up for you okay now so shooting myself is not the point the point is the debt similarly left to themselves nobody would want to cease to exist now at minus 30 I do not want to cease to exist I never wanted to get rid of myself one if I never want to get rid of myself I always want to keep myself then I must always like myself if I always like myself then I must be always a source of happiness to myself happiness look at if you have taken notes happiness liking eating keeping myself preserving myself all the time meat I like myself all the time and like myself all the time needs and my own source of happiness if you and the doubts you may have been worked out for yourself is you know Swami I don't like that I often take myself but you need something about yourself not the theory here being or pure existence now the fact that you are something contingent which can be changed that's what you are overweight I need to lose weight I hate myself somebody says like all that it's nonsense it's something that has been put into our line specially by modern culture Western culture in I remember in India specially until say fifty years ago I think essentially if you were over it it's a sign of after being good it's nice if you are overweight if if food is a problem in a starving population being orbited sign of prosperity in rural India needs to enough you see of fact if they would say committing a crime if the point comes from the house which is prosperous there a nice food to eat so anyway the point is your pure being itself you never want to get rid of you want to change something that's all so you never maybe hit yourself you always like yourself writing something means source of happiness like yourself you are your own source of happiness permanently logic one point I told you it's a strange way of thinking but trying to argue around if you cannot alright the second thing is is a next verse not only our names of your permanent source of happiness the self is not only the permanent source of happiness it's the highest source prema [Music] [Music] all right what's the logic here what's the reasoning here another very interesting they are thinking listen to this it's like this if something is loved for the sale of something else something in love for the sake of something else then you love this one more than this one what does it mean mother loves the toys of her baby now who why does she have the toys because they are developed to her baby but to her child now who does she love more the toy of the way obviously the maybe you're laughing would be your mother who loved to try out in the him in everything ever shouldn't say every radio time so I change this so the mother loves the baby more than the printer type love the type for the sake of the baby so this ladies love more than the time everything is love for the sake of the self the self is not learned for anything else and in Britain in the universe that you love it's because it makes you happy and you don't love yourself for anything else if you love something for the sake of another that one is love a particular for the sake of the self in that case itself is lovely most remember the very allergic what do you love that which makes you happy what do you love or at which makes you more like what do you love most that it makes you most happy you love the self the most source of the highest happiness with the story of Maria executed who said I love my job big multinational corporation I love my job and then he was told by its philosophy teacher that yeah you love your job all right in that case you can go on doing your job you won't be paid for it I need I need the money all right all right you will be paid you get the money but you won't get to spend it that's crazy I need the money for my business so many things you know so many nice things I need to buy those things all right and spend the money for those things but you can't use any of them no I need to use it for my family I need the vacation and the nice cool and the car and the house and eat there for my family ok you can use all of them for the family but it won't be your family so ultimately it comes down to remember they Lantern never tells you to be selfish in fact it can explain unselfishness better than anything else the person who says hi I'm not I'm not doing things because of myself I do things but others I like making other people happy I like solving the problems of other people we don't even say look at your language I like when you are an unselfish when you make a donation when you see the smiles in the pieces of other people who need your help does that make you happy or a man happy if it made you unhappy wouldn't do it so ultimately it makes you happy in fact you are selfish but in a much more wise way than the other person who's selfish in an otherwise me those are all twisting those who are unselfish they are it is the own selfish they are making happy but in a wiser way they are doing it for the bigger self but still the point still holds ultimately air everything is because of the self the self is loved about everything else when if you love it in a small mean individual sense it's called selfishness when you love it in a mature way filling that green things for others makes me truly happy then you are all altruistic and unselfish but without the point still boats it is the self alone which is the object of greatest love the University that which you love the most is something that definitely makes you most happy otherwise you would love it so the self is the source of the highest happiness verse eight said sentence the source of permanent happiness verse 9 says self to source of highest happiness congratulations you come to the end of the road we have made this presentation now and we end the tenth verse with your gift tie the strings together 10th verse he concludes [Music] [Music] machete superfish hence in this manner we have proved the self optimistic you you are such cheap animal we have proved that you are your consciousness we have proved that you are undying any Multipure existence and you prove that you are the highest please ah you I won't even say the author says Atma but the other thing is you know mind restricts so only you just proved that the AHA is existence consciousness place but doesn't solve my problem you are near that's what you are you are under severe this year okay it has been proved just now you are some pure consciousness pure existence pure bliss some chit Ananda how did we prove it yuki-onna by reasoning upon available experience there learner once will beep speak about having a vision of God or miracle Kosovar is nothing what did you speak about waking dreaming sleeping loving existing all the things that we've seen all the time just by reasoning upon that Gupta fifty needs reasoning reasoning upon already available experience we have proven you are of the nature of you are chit Ananda eggs this consciousness please okay now open the Oh Ganesha open your Vedanta book what does it say brother Han is such it it defines you use the word problem you open the book with such chit Ananda we see hey wait a minute didn't you just prove that I am such it on yes who police in Ramadan yes in that case diodes Czechia the oneness of the brahma of the opposition and you what does it mean something very profound it means two things when you say I am relevant searched on now we know the meaning subject we know the meaning of stuff we know the meaning upon and the borderless indication what did it mean budget what did it mean by self what did they mean by American Idol I am such a talent the means I am NOT the body his body not succeeded and not the mind and not even this little person his personality I am Brahman meets all of these things that's why Shankar Acharya when he sings siddhanam Rupa a shivoham I am of the nature of chipped on the Shiva nature of that before that what does he say mano Oh God domina I am not the mind not the ego not the memory not that intellect I am not the five senses I'm not the body made of the five elements then only I can say tada why have I got those things those things remember they're objects you are the awareness of those objects maybe not cheering I'm not pushing you into it I want you to see it if you see it your job is done all that you need to do after that is to abide and let's see if you do not see it then I then tell you to study and I tell you to meditate and then you do almost also spiritual practices for the next 45 years what will happen at the end of it you will see it so it's good for you right now I am part of my body sabrina is such a tall order and they are one and the same first thing is you are random means you are not the body not the mind not the person nothing to make not even the memories there are all objects in your life that's one and the second one is even more overwhelming I said it means two things it means one thing is that you are not the body mind complex you are subject under the other one the obverse of it is even more radical I am Brahman means remedies I other than you this know Brahman there is no Shiva no Father in heaven Hallowed Aparna option I think other than you yes that's what it means you are nothing other than ground and Brahman is nothing other than you so I'm in creation and the story about in his disciple of the Holy Mother among very senior one told me the story he used to go to some information under who was regarded as an enlightened person so this mom who told me the story he said that as a young student has to go to some information hunter and once I found out to him and the old Swami he leaned over he was 60 the Fed leaned over with his trembling finger touch in the forehead and sort of jumped it was so startling and he said in Bengali enchanted Oh a lily de Tokyo Chara una llamada one knee he said that that one which reacted it started it other than that and trust me to betray you will be shot other than that there is no rascal third God no rascal - in language rough language - pure consciousness remember I'm not telling you the person Oh John's on a musical John is not know what is John in the body and mind of John then no it's an object pure consciousness the awareness in which John appears that awareness that's common causes that the values in this awareness you are not different bodies our minds are different personality is a different personal histories are different but awareness is impersonal and one everywhere other than that and then you see many questions come with the internet starts thinking about these things we will see many discussion should be there so those who need those questions will be answered by what you need for enlightenment has been said here and I won't say the dome is the third person is if you do not see for a fact you have lights of spiritual and then you'd only see further that's so it's a fact right now it's not that if you become becoming your consciousness afterwards you know you want that right now I don't see it now [Music] [Music] you
