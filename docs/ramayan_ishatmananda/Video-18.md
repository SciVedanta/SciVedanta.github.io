[18. Ramayana: “Sri Rama Accepts the Challenge”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vackYUk2ExQ)

foreign [Music] [Music] foreign that this is the ramachandra the we were studying SRI ramachandra ramayana for a long period of time from so we started it from March 2021 now this is the March 2023 so this long period slowly we are starting three ramayana that this is the path of Sri Rama now we came to the last December when we were discussing about ramayana we came to that part where the shita has been abducted by the ravana and Rama lakshmana they were searching for the Sita they were meeting different people at different places and they were going on getting some information and ultimately they came to kiskinda that the place where the bali's brother sugriva was hiding and with him was hanumana the hanumana was supporting sugrivab and the Bali and sugriva the two brothers there was a misunderstanding between them and the Bali wanted to kill sugriva and sugriba was going from place to place to save his life then ultimately he came to a place where Bali was not supposed to come because he was cursed by a Muni by a greater Yogi that if he comes over there then he will die so Bali was afraid to go over there that is the place where sugar was hiding he was in Exile and from distance they saw one day the two brothers they are coming and they are carrying a sword and the bow and arrow these are the two weapons it was unknown to though that part of India so usually they used to fight ah physically like the wrestling and they used to use the stones or and maybe they were very strong people so these two uproot the trees through all those type of things they used to use for fighting but they were not accustomed with this type of weapons the advanced weapon in those days the bow and arrow and also the sword so this is this was the picture and Bali was in Exile SRI ramachandra himself was also in Exile but there are two differences the great difference like the Heaven and the Earth SRI Rama himself took that upon himself that I will go in Exile why to keep the the word of my father took the Satya Balan that is the Dharma the once you have given the word you must have to keep it that was the teaching of Sri Rama he never said it um but he practiced it and from his life people started understanding what should be the Dharma though we know that SRI Rama's time immediately after the Satya Yuga it was the three dapar and Kali it was the the Satya Yuga next most of the people were good they were rishis and at the same time the the rajaguna that was also taking form and that is why we find the rabana the Bali and many other the rakshasas so rajaguna was becoming more predominant and it was necessary for the god to come to give the idea what the Dharma should be the Supreme Lord the Vishnu he took the SRI Rama form and he was reestablishing the Dharma what is that you have to keep the world so the Rama he told his father you should keep your word and we have seen in every step of his life wherever he has gone he always kept his promises and here when he came in search of Sita he met the hanumana and hanumana and took him to his King the sugriva and told he is in Exile but he is the real king of this Kingdom his elder brother Bali forcefully has taken away not only his kingdom but his wife also his family is ruined so if you you to become friends then you can help each other so they became friends the sugriva and SRI ramachandra but once again I'd like to remind you all the sugriva he was an ordinary person like us the Jiva so he was in Exile why because he wanted to save his life why he wanted to save his life because he had the desire to become king he was once the king and he wanted to become the king but he is the elder brother the neighbor believed him he wanted to not only just drive away but to kill him so he was forced to be in that Exile that as we are we take birth we take human form we suffer we enjoy we go in the circle of birth and death that is not that we wanted that is our Karma Pala but SRI Rama the god in human form he was completely free from the karma follow it was not his karma it was his just his own wish that I should teach the people what the Dharma is and Dharma is sadashar and this Sada achara that means practicing the truthfulness and behaving properly so that was what SRI Rama was teaching in those days Ordinary People they were bit confused what should be the family life because the satta Yuga majority they were rishis they were very wonderful people but the next again treta Yuga and what will happen they were confused in the meantime the big Society Human Society I'm talking about the India Indian Peninsula so that human being were there and different type of tribes have also come the jammuan they used to consider themselves as the worshipers of the Bears and the Hanuman they're like this our sugriva and hanumana the Bali they were the very powerful people the tribal people they mostly used to live in the the hills and these two think that they are the hanumana and that means the monkeys they used to wear like that and they behave like that so different type of there were jota use these two worship the the vultures and the huge huge the the bird in and they used to think that they are the worshiper of birds as to behave like that so we should not think that they were truly birds or the monkeys or the Bears no they were human being but the tribals and they had their own the process of worship and process of leaving the ramachandra is a perfect human being so he is entering into these societies and transforming them and giving them the true Dharma they were powerful people they were good people but because of they had the tremendous power in the physical power and they were but not that of developed a culture so their behavior was little different the SRI ramachandra the god in human form and trying to establish the Dharma he is entering over there it was the pretext the Sita the power of God and the wife of God in the human form the she was abducted by the Rama and Rama going over there to save his wife that is also the teaching in those days the wife that means any you any lady you can accept as your wife that was the norm so we can see in the society that was the norm when the surpanaka came and he was requesting SRI Rama or SRI afterwards the lakshmana to meet her so it was nothing abnormal in those days though the the women could choose in that way the what whomever he she liked but SRI Rama and SRI lakshmana punished her now you have to control your this physical hunger and this type of last you should behave properly so if we judge ramayana from a different angle the Viewpoint we will find everywhere in every situation SRI ramachandra establishing a system so that the Human Society become developed controlled and civilized society so that was the the work of the god SRI Rama came he met this creeper and he became his friend and sugriva told that this is the story I I was not at fault and we know that those things we have already read we have heard the stories and my elder brother misunderstood me then he is now after me wants to kill me but I have a desire to become king again because I didn't do anything wrong why should he behave like that Rama understanding his point accepted his friendship and challenges the Rama accepted the challenges what is the challenge challenge to fight against Bali now there are some of the stories that the sugriva is telling to Sri Rama to make him understand how powerful this Bali is the Bali himself said afterwards when will he will meet the Rama that you are going to save your wife Sita from the hands of the ravana you could tell it to me I could easily go and Vanquish the ravana and bring back your wife there's a different story I am so powerful and the sugriva told Rama I am happy that you have accepted with my friendship but I like to tell you the power of the Balian he said there was a very powerful person his name is dunduvi this dunduvi the he was so big huge and you are so powerful that it was impossible to fight with him so that the story goes like that he went to the ocean God and said hey I like to fight with you ocean said no I am not capable to fight with you you better go to Himalaya the Himalaya is a huge huge there the person and I think both you will be equal so he went and challenged Himalaya Himalaya said you see I like meditation and I gave the shelter to those who are coming for meditation peaceful life I am I don't like to accept your challenges in those days it is not just for something just to prove that I am physically powerful this to go from place to place and challenging people that was the way of the shatrias so we went to the Himalaya that also does not possible so this dundubi then finally came to Bali because Himalaya the king of the Himalaya he said you better go to Bali Bali is also just like you he also wants to fight all the time why don't you go to Bali and challenge him we came to Bali and see Bali killed him now you can imagine the power of Bali I am not trying to frighten you my friend then the sugriva was telling to Sri ramachandra don't think I am just frightening you I am giving an idea to whom you are going to fight it is good that one should first know the power of the enemy then one can plan the way he should fight it is no problem with me don't worry about me I will take care of it then he said by throwing a in an arrow boy an arrow or maybe some piercing that the trees Seven Trees in one line Bali could do that so know for sure the Bali is so powerful it is possible for me it is no problem so Rama accepted the challenge to face the Bali now he told don't worry at all have complete faith on me go and challenge the Bali believing the words of Sri ramachandra now sugriva came back to kiskinda at the the capital of their Kingdom so where Bali used to live and barley forcedfully took away the wife of that sugriva so and the the he they were there the sugriva came and from the outside of the fort we can understand because the door was closed and there's a big the fort like place so he outside he was challenging the rain he was challenging this immediately Tara the wife of the Bali understood she was very intelligent lady and she told the Bali so griba is coming over here a challenging you no no no wait and see who is at his back there must be some powerful person who is supporting him otherwise the person who was defeated and the person who was running all over just to save his life from your hand how come today he has come and challenging you to fight but the Bali was a very confident about his own power so when the ego comes then that takes us for the destruction the Tara the intelligent lady his wife was giving the right advices the instead of just going and accepting the challenge you better wait and see who is at his back why the man who was afraid all through now became so powerful and challenging you has he developed something is he is having some different weapons what is that is he having some support but the Bali never listened to Tara he just opened the door and he went out and then accepted the challenge of the sugriva and two brothers started fighting and wrestling so both of them were throwing stones to each other and they were wrestling they were fisting and all the whole day long then ultimately the sugriva ran away from the field and he was hiding somewhere Bali told him that tomorrow next day I will fight again so in those days that was the system that the daytime only you can fight and not in the night so the sugriva went and saved himself and he was actually healing his all the wounds and then he looked at the SRI Rama and told how come friend you promised that you will support me you will kill Bali and how come that you didn't do that then I'm really wondering do you want me to die in his hand then the SRI Rama no a problem was both of you look the same your physical the from the distance it was so difficult for me to identify who is Bali and who is a grieva so I couldn't shoot my arrow for that so I was waiting that now tomorrow he asked lakshmana to bring some the beautiful flowery and beautiful smell and some creepers very strong creepers can you please bring those creepers and make a girl and out of that and tomorrow when the sugriva is going to challenge the Bali once again put that in his the neck so I can identify seeing the girl and from the distance that this is our friend and that is the enemy so they did that and the second day the Bali was killed so second day also Tara told that please wait and see he must be having some support from a very powerful person and then Tara came to know because those peoples also they were the Kings they were the rulers they were having their own people to collect the information so obviously Tara got the information the SRI ramachandra has come and she immediately came to know the Rama is the son of the kiss the king of that or the great king was very famous all this place was under his the kingdom the rule so obviously they knew him a very powerful person his son SRI Rama and not only that Rama's brother lakshmana was very famous one for his archery so both of them have come not only that they are having the very Advanced weapons with them that is the bow and arrow and also the sword so I think you better go and talk to Sri Rama develop friendship with the SRI Rama and try to help SRI Rama he has come and all the stories they came to know he has come to the find his wife who has been abducted by Rama rabana so it will be good for you but Bali never pay any heat to the advice is of the his wife so he went again the next day to fight with his brother sugriva and then the Rama and pierced him with his powerful the arrow and Bali fell to die the when the Bali was lying down Rama came near to him Bali told SRI Rama you are the son of the great king dasharata how come that you killed me from from back from hiding from somewhere the ram killed him on his chest and that Arrow your peers though how come do you you were hiding somewhere and from there only using this Arrow you killed me you have not challenged me moreover we are not enemies and and I came to know from my wife that you have come to find out your wife who has been abducted by ravana you could tell it to me I could defeat rabanat and can bring back your wife and there is a this is the only weak point of Sri Rama and another is sending the uh the Sita in Exile these are the two weak points in the Holy life of Sri Rama some people they say but the then there were many answers are there in the ramacharit manush there there is also in the he is telling that our goshami tulsidas ji he has given and many explanations but from the view of the the devotee he is a devotee and the Rama is his God so he he was telling Rama actually giving the mukti to the Bali now when before just before the death Bali was looking at SRI Rama he was again and again pronouncing the Holy Name Rama Rama by that way his soul was liberated that is one of the many points of the and many of the people they say in that way and many they frown and say why why Rama should do like that but SRI Rama himself has given the answer he said or sugar sorry oh Bali you are also at the son of a king and you are a shatria you have also learned as we all Dharma and sadashar Dharma Moksha instead of Moksha is so we have all learned the ad that all educated that the high society people they used to go to the guru griha and in the guru grihas all the learn this what is the Dharma Dharma is the or what one should do perform so that is the Dharma the duties as a son duties as a father duties as a king duties as so all these things are the Dharma Dharma means whatever responsibility that you are accepting you should perform that properly and in that different stages of Life different type of Dharma so we have learned that and Ortho Karma we know that we get some money when we are young we are utilizing our education our power some are becoming shatriya some are becoming cultivators some are becoming businessmen like this so there's uh this that way we earn something and then we enjoy our desires fulfill our desires so Dharma Ortho Karma and then Sada achara means action the action not only through physically but also in thought and also through words physically you should be very very careful why you have forcefully accepted your brother's wife as your wife the brother was leaving and your brother's wife was not willing just forced her and to behave as your wife that was not good that was the main against you first second your brother who was so truthful to you who was all the time serving you and it was a mistake when he saw the blood coming out from that cave whose door was closed you asked him to close the door other people never knew you asked him to do that and when he saw the blood is flowing back so he thought the powerful demon has killed you to save his own life he came back then when you were not returning all the ministers then selected him to be king it was not his will and when you came back he came to you narrated everything that was everything was true why you could not understand your brother and forgive him so why is the sadashara the king should follow all these then only it will go down to the society the every Rank and file will understand what it should do looking at the Kings the king that's why they say Raja that is the the in the whole society Raja is the first person even in the modern society also the Democratic country also the president is the first citizen of that country whatever the president of the prime ministers are doing that is followed by all Rank and file all people so obviously being a king you were supposed to do all this but you didn't do that Bali understood that so Bali was in the beginning he was complaining against Rama he said the I could defeat ravana your only ah desire is to bring back your wife so the ravana abducted I could help you secondly you are not my enemy so why you have killed uncertainty that SRI Rama said I have friendship with sugriva not with you so when the sugriva first came to me and sugriva said that I want to be your friend I accepted him as my friend and as a friend it is my duty to support my friend that that is why I stood behind him to support him that is my Dharma I didn't do anything wrong so you have not inquired toward the friends of the sugriva the Tara told you but you didn't listen to her look at your ego Bali understood it's true I should have known that tala told me so naturally then Bali became very calm and he said I am sorry he said to Tara he said to his son and he said to his brother also sugriva sugriva started weeping crying virtually and Tara came took out the arrow and when the blood was flowing she knew that the Bali won't survived she called her son angadar and said talk to your father take the dust of you the feet of your father see all these things when we read the same culture the advanced culture so the same thing we see in the family of Sri Rama also touching the the feet of the seniors the parents here the angada was instructed by his mother the Tara and he did that and Tara was asking is her husband Tara was requesting her husband the powerful Bali then why don't you talk why don't you get up you have tremendous strain but Bali said no I am going to die so listen to the sugriva and he looked at the sugriva and said the take care of them the sugriva he was a good person naturally and then he came to Rama and he was telling why I had to kill my brother only for the kingdom the ravan Rama said no it was for the Dharma so he was so much egoistic that he was not understanding anything now his ego has gone now he has understood what is good now his mind is becoming purified and he will be liberated let him go to in Liberation so things were all done ravana asks lakshmana to take care of the final ah the rights of the Bal Bali and lakshmana he arranged everything with the help of other hanumanas other monkeys so they all went and with great respect they attended the final right of the Bali then they came back and again the he became the sugriva became the king and he embraced the son of his brother because sugriba was not having an issue so he accepted the son of the Bali his elder brother as the prince of the country everybody appreciated it his broadness so this is the our picture in the meantime rainy season came and in those places in the jungle and Hills rainy season means no one can move nothing can be done so it was decided that let everybody take rest and when the rainy season will be over after two months three months then the sugriva will arrange to send out his soldiers to all corners of the world to find out Sita do we find that then ultimately Rama was waiting for that Rama and lakshmana in one place and slowly slowly rainy season was over then finally when all this was over Rama noticed that shugriba is not doing anything but actually sugriba did when the rainy season was over the Tara told now you have to keep your promise you promise that you will help Rama to find his wife immediately he remembered and he called the meeting of his ministers and asked send out the message that all powerful hanumanas should come or the monkey group should come in in thousands and in lacks within one month and within 30 days they should be here in kiskinda and if they are late I will give them punishment it may be death even so that message was sent and Powerful all this the the soldiers started coming to the capital Rama didn't get that information perhaps so he was waiting and when he found that nothing has been taken care then he became little worried he asked that it is became it is better that you go you better go and tell him that why you are not doing anything so we are waiting you better go and and tell remind him that I am here and as I killed your elder brother I can't punish you too so do what has been said to you immediately you should do he said the panther the way that the Bali has taken that means the I killed Bali that that has not been the completely closed I still have the weapon I still have the power so indirectly he was sending the message to the sugriba that I may kill you too if you are not keeping your promise narrowed panta means a path the path that was taken to punish the Bali your elder brother it has not been abundant it is still there that you must utilize the time and keep your promise otherwise you will be killed so you will be dead so that is the way he sent the message when the that is the wonderful description is there when the lakshmana went over there the lakshmana was so powerful that everybody was afraid in lakshmana we entered into uh there that their uh the house we can say the huge huge house and that there were seven the compartments you have to cross to reach to the king so that was a huge house and lakshmana entered he found that everybody is enjoying he became very angry he said that the Sita is suffering Rama is waiting for this and these people are enjoying now this fun-loving people I also spend some time with the tribal people they are very simple they are very good people very powerful people but fun loving people they are not like the the plain people the the people who lives in the plane they can hide their emotions they can hide their feelings these people are not like that they're very simple type of people so we can imagine I can imagine that this also the banarakula they were also like that they were very good people very powerful people intelligent people but fun loving so they were enjoying their life because inside the houses inside the rooms it was all raining what they will do they enjoying their life but the king he kept his promise and he already started taking the action he was on that so ravana and as a rama and lakshmana was not knowing that now the lakshmana came then sugriva understood because he has started the character of these two brothers he understood that if I now go lakshmana being short tempered may say something directly to me and being a king of this place if he insult me before everyone then it will be very difficult situation to handle so he told that Tara you better go and talk to lakshmana shikriwa knew lakshmana never looked at the women so the moment the Tara approached lakshmana immediately lowered down his eyes and he was very quietly because he was not showing any anger before a lady that Tara took that opportunity and went before the lakshmana and he said she said to lakshmana don't misunderstand our King he has already taken action now he has sent the messages for all the people from all round all over all the hilly regions to come over here hundreds and thousands they are coming it will take some time so have patience don't misunderstand and don't fight with him he is going to help you and by that way you should also have the respect and love for him believe him once he has given the word he will keep the word then lakshmana became the calm down and the lakshmana entered into the house or the where the sugriva was leaving and he found that he is sitting with his wife then lakshmana told the SRI Rama is thinking that you should take action then sugriva explained everything and in the meantime lakshmana also noticed that very powerful ah this people are coming and they are gathering they are waiting for the order and preparation is going on you know when a big operation is going to take place it takes long time for the to arrange so who will be the leader who will how many soldiers he will go with him and to which direction they will go what will be there the actions what they should do then all those things you have to take the arrangement and you must do so that was going on and slowly slowly when all they came then one day after the 30 days then there was a huge commotion the like the ocean also many soldiers in thousands and in Lacks then sugriva like a great leader he called binata binata was a very powerful person he said you should be the leader and take the a few lakhs of soldiers with you and go to the east Rama was observing how the shigriva was arranging and organizing and he was wondering how he knew the whole India what was there in the East what how much the distance they can go the one the the ocean and each and every place sugriba was going on telling at ease as if he has already visited those places so he told binata you took this people and go to the east search every nooken corner every cave every village every Hamlet and come back within 30 days not more than 30. if you fail then all the members of your group including you will be punished and the punishment will be I will kill you all and secondly he said but if you can come out and bring the information about the mother Sita then I will give you lot of wealth so all through your life you can enjoy and then he said the angada the prince to the South and he's saying his father-in-law the father of Tara sushena sushino was a very intelligent person and very powerful person then he went to the West the East the binata West the father of the Tara and the Sushin and the North shatabala and to the South angada was the prince all based people of his the kingdom he sent along with him and there were the our hanumana was also there the group of people there and that followed by hundreds and thousands of soldiers now the east west north south everywhere almost every nook and corner of India we can say and groups after groups after within 30 days so they went as quickly as possible as fast as possible and they were going on searching collecting information no one could give any positive information so from the east from the west from the north group came back but not the group that was led by angatha and they went to the South they went went and then finally they couldn't get any information anywhere and the angada he was telling let us go little deeper and there was a channel type of place little what is there inside let us go and they went inside that took time it was slippery so very carefully they had to go when they reached down over there they found as a beautiful place the lot of jewelries lot of gold lot of wealth that everywhere and one lady saint she was meditating over there that is swayam prabha the wind they went and met the same prabha the angadar wonderfully the worshiped her and said mother we are very very hungry and thirsty and we kept came came down this long Channel and we do not know how to go out of this place because that is the only Channel and it is coming down so can you please help us and we have come to help SRI Rama Chandra to find out his wife who was abducted by the ravana now this swayam prabha as The Story Goes she told this is the actual story of this place I am taking care of this place so she told and that way and then I am not going entering into that story again and she told I will help you first you go have some food bathe in the cool water and drink the fresh water and take the rest I will lead you and I will send take you out on the shore of the ocean and she did after coming out from there then they counted it was more than 30 days and this angada he called all the his soldiers and his ministers and they say officers and said see our King is a very powerful King once he has declared before everyone that whoever will go back after 30 days and without success will be killed will be punished so death is inevitable and moreover the angada came out because his father was killed by his uncle he said this is the person who killed my father this is the person who has forced my mother to stay back with him and of course he will show no compassion for me he will kill me it is better that we live over here then one or two they told why don't you start a separate the state over here we are all with you though more than the few lakhs we are here we are powerful we can start a separate State over here Kingdom you will be our King Hanuman all through followed them he was with them he never talked now he said never made that mistake I was the minister of the sugriva I know that he is the kind-hearted person and he love you and he had great respect for your father too and he will never take revenge uh we better go back to him so when that debate was going on then suddenly they saw a person coming as like a bird he came and he said oh it is good that you people have come over here so I will be able to eat you up then they said hey who are you so he said I am the uh the elder brother of jotayu and my name is sampathi angada went to him and said sir your brother this jatayu he fought against the ravana to save Mother Sita and he was injured by severely injured by the ravana he passed away for this cause we have come for the same purpose now you like to kill us all he started crying is it my young brother has died I never knew you I wanted to see him but I am I have become so old I cannot move so that is the reason but you know I have a great eyesight I can see a long distance thing from here I can see inside the C there is an island and in that Island there is ravana and ravana has kept one lady who was throwing all his jewelries while she was going along with ravana and I could see that she is crying and taking the name of Sri Rama and SRI lakshmana she must be the Sita I can tell you in which direction is the island and you can go over there then they were so happy after such a long period of time and after so much of toil than the the searching that they have done this is the positive the reply has come there is an island and in that Island there is Mother shita and that is the place where rabana is leaving now up to this they found out now the question was who can cross the ocean because the ocean stress is there and that is the island we have to go over there and who can go and bring back that the information is correct or not the there's a beautiful description of the ocean in the ramayana then some places it is calm as if the ocean is sleeping some places only the small small ah that the waves but in some places it is so big huge waves so you have to cross the whole ocean near to at the shore it is all calm but the more you go inside it is very ah the huge waves are coming so how to go so all they were sitting over there and they were bewildering all their thinking how we can cross this Ocean Suddenly the jammuan he came stood before the hanumana and he said foreign this wonderful words now the Hanuman and we think in the in our next class we will have that little discussion about this I will just tell the meaning of this and he came over here and jambuban he came and told Hanuman and as if he is rising the power of hanumana and he told o Hanuman have you forgotten your power and you are tremendous you have the tremendous power you can at ease cross this ocean is the ocean is the great ocean and that is the Bharat mahasagar that you can at ease you can cross you get up arise you can help each and everyone all being that is the power you have now these all people your friends all the hanumanas they are bishana they are in great distress they are thinking that success will never come but that is not you can do it so you why you are waiting then you must like the Vishnu Vishnu is the great God very powerful God who can move faster than anything you too can do that so realize your own power and get up all Hanuman cross the ocean go to the other shore of the ocean to that Island bring all information about mother srita and help us all so that we can go with success and meet SRI Rama so hanumana will get up so that why Hanuman forgot so that story next month we will again continue with this so thank you friends so I thank you dear devotees so it is a wonderful that we are continuously step by step we are going on today as I told and I like to remind you then SRI Rama was in Exile he was out of his own country but of in his own will and sugriva was in Exile but he was forced too so this is the difference between jibatma and paramatma the paramatma he takes the human form as SRI Rama came but he was not born as bhagavan SRI ramakrishna came but he was not bound as SRI Krishna came he was not bound but we the ordinary Jiva we are bound so we have to take their path that's why Rama Ayana and that means the path that the Rama showed we should follow so thank you let us say Shanti three times and we conclude oh oh Shanti foreign [Music] [Music]
