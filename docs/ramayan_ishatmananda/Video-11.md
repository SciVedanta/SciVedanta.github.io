[Ramayana 011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ708DhcPYc)

good night good night good day uh good evening good evening everyone there this is uh we will be studying now the ramayana so let us please start with [Music] [Music] rama now friends we were reading the meeting of the two great brothers the one is sri ramachandra himself another is bharata and rishi balmiki has described that in a beautiful way in every chapter of the ramayana is a unique wonderful and here we find and the the culture of the old tradition of india the brother all the brothers are ready to sacrifice the sacrifice is the basis of our dharma here sri rama went to exile to keep the honor of his father king dasharatha bharata went to jungle to honor his father's wish to make rama the king both the brothers were great in their sacrifices bharata could ignore bharata could become the king but no he sincerely wanted the rama should be the king and rama could also become a king because his father wanted everyone wanted he could simply deny and no one knew what his father promised to his mother kiki but no he said nothing i am not going to so this is the story that we are going to listen from the the balmiki so both are ready to sacrifice the tiaga taga is a sacrifice to giving up that is exactly what is our the india's national characteristics the tyaga sri rama is a great because of his modesty valor perfection administration and knowledge binaya birya daksata shashan gyana and we will afterwards we will find the bharata was also possessing the same qualities as sri ramachandra when the bharata saw the cottage of sri rama he left behind all the retinue his mothers the ministers the officers the soldiers everyone only he and the guru bashishta and a few others they they went over there was very intelligent the he realized that if he goes with all his people and approach to the cottage lakshmana may doubt him and see how he was thinking lakshmana really we have already heard the valmiki mentioned the lakshmana really doubted him when he is coming with all the people he saw from the distance the dust and he doubted that he is coming to attack so he asked the sri ramachandra to get ready for the fight but the ramachandra though he was not very senior but still he was so wise he said no he is not coming for that fighting he he already became the king so he is coming not to kill me maybe to meet me and then when the lakshmana was eager to fight he was excited then the rama sri he told him well if you were trying to fight with bharata the for the kingdom i will ask bharata to get give the kingdom to you all these words that you are talking about the bharata if this is only for the kingdom well i will ask bharata to gift it to you bakshami bharatam drishtva raja masmi pradhiyatam pradhiyatam he will give it he will gift it to you i will tell him to do that then he said have you ever found the bharata is misbehaving with you then why you are doubting you one should not doubt like that sometimes we act just with imagination oh this is going to happen he is going to attack he is going to criticize on the basis of that we always do like that but the rama is so wise because he observed that person the bharata was always so friendly and so humble and naturally there is no reason to doubt him right now so bharata came all alone and last month we have seen that the rakshmanna was rebuked by the rama the bharata's love and respect for sri rama was very very genuine he came running towards the rama and fell at his feet saying o arya rishi balmiki has given a graphic description of the meeting of the two brothers the bharata is addressing his elder brother srirama as arya swami vivekananda mentioned that this arya is a culture it's not a race the european scholars they always try to say the arya and anaria they are racists and the aryas they came from europe so that they wanted to say because they were they captured the india and they wanted to say the the indians are nothing there or naturally they they tried in their own way but they failed swami vivekananda some of our indian scholars also and even today they're very eager to say that the aryans came from outside but swami vivekananda was very clear he said it is culture and not the race those who were highly cultured people they were called the aryans arya even the wives they used to address their husbands as arya the brother he is addressing his brother arya sri krishna when the arjuna was behaving very peculiarly the sri krishna became angry so he's rebuked him by saying anarya yustam aswargam akirthi karamarayana why you are behaving like an anarya anarja means uncultured uneducated uncle doesn't know how to behave doesn't know what to do what to say what type of words should be used so these are called uncultured so this is the way he says bharata were addressing sri ramachandra oh aryan both are humble gentle courteous but firm in performing their dharma their righteousness sri rama ramachandra he wanted to keep the vows that his father given to the mother kaiki and because he was over there it is not the lakshman lakshmana shatrukna the vada that is rama with the kaikei she wanted that rama should go into jungle and bharata should be placed as the king so naturally rama told i should go to the jungle now the bharata came back because he was in his maternal uncle's house so grandfather's house was the kingdom uh near the punjab present punjab so obviously the after spending a long years when he came back he never knew the planning the mother was doing but everybody was blaming blaming him so he was handling the situation very wonderfully he performed everything that the seniors particularly the guru asked him to do guru vashishta and then he was leading a a huge you know that we were discussing the team to ramachandra all the generals army generals all the gurus and all the ministers and all the noble male men people of the kingdom each and everyone came so he wanted to present before rama look at it everyone wants you to go back so he is the elder brother should be the king after the father well bharat's argument the bharat was arguing elder brother should be the king and sri rama chandra was arguing keeping the words of the father is the dharma of the son a son a daughter should listen to their father their mother their parents so this is the dharma sanatana dharma so i am performing that and bharata was telling the tradition and the custom it says that the elder brother should become in place of the father so they were so rama was not aware of his father king dashiratha's past to be the rama never knew that he is assad passed away he asked his brother bharata oh brother where is father now well why have you come to this deep jungle how is our family how is the priest bashista our queen kaushallah sumitra doing well so he was inquiring from bharata now friends i will from here we will find how rama as an elder brother he is asking different christians to know about the family and at the same time he was giving the advice to his brother rama was not how many few maybe a year or maybe a two years like the older than the bharata but his maturity as a king as an administrator we will wonder so these things i feel anyone who wants to become a leader an administrator and must read to govern what are the things one should take care but he is not telling directly he indirectly he is reminding his brother bharata these are i won't say all those because there are not many things he was instructing and asking a few we will read so he is giving the bharata some of the qualities of the ruler so rama knew for sure the bharata is going to rule and what a ruler should do what are the qualities the best qualities that a ruler should have so he is going on telling the the leaders and administrators who like to be successful and to be remembered by the people must read these pages this is a beautiful when you talk about sramachandra we are mostly we talk that he is fighting with the ravana and he is a a very in a courageous person like that like that and we put him on the as a god of course he is god but how he is manifesting his godship by observing the promises that is the first thing and the wonderful behavior his relation that also we should notice those who are worshiping sri rama chandra unless we notice all the good qualities that rama was having so how we can love him respect him and worship him and what is the use of worshipping just as the story and like that so this is the ramayana that we are studying to learn what we are going to learn the wonderful characteristics and right this moment when the two great brothers are meeting and we will find that the sri rama was supposed to be the king he is proving his father was correct his training and his understanding was so clear as an administrator now he knew that instead of him it is his brother no jealousy let the brother fail in his administration and people will criticize him they will remember me never like that majority of our the rulers and nowadays not the kings but the ministers when they are elected as the top leader they always think they will be criticized and predecessors and they like to prove that all my predecessors are bad they couldn't do anything i am only the person doing at the same time they will keep thinking in such a way so the successors will also be in a great difficulty that is very bad administration in the end of this chapter we will find what the rama's comment i am not mentioning here now as example i shall mention a few such questions that sri rama asked his brother bharata which will prove the great administrative mind of sri rama he asked o dear bharata do you show proper respect to the deities father father like teachers old and the physicians and to your employees the first question is asking why the king is surrounded by these people and if we are not respecting the elderly people those who are before me because of their dedication i have come to this situation this position and if i completely ignore them they'll be unhappy and their unhappiness will cause trouble for me so the first thing that we we should have to keep them happy by giving them respect paying them respect father father like people so those who were the friends of the father maybe old ministers etc physicians these are the people the physicians and others they are completely nowadays and all over the world these are the physicians they are helping the whole humanity isn't it that there are researchers they are going on researching day and night to find out some medicine so that the death can be stopped maybe that they are taking some money but still shall we not be grateful to them so the physicians they are like gods when we are in problem physically they are coming and helping so we must have to give the respect so that they are happy and a happy person will be more useful than an unhappy person so the employees also should be properly giving the respect second he's telling have you engaged high born valiant wise and self-controlled person as your counselors those who will be giving you the advices in your troubled time the this is the question he's asking if i go on taking the decision there may be some mistake you know sometimes some people after becoming the chief of that country they think they can do anything but there are things which the scientists can advise there are things the others they are experts the economist they can advise so obviously a king will take the decision that should be under the capacity of the king but he should take the proper advices see the so modern any any period of time any time this these are the things that and this is what sri ramachandra is teaching this is the great greatness of sri ramachandra have we ever discussed about this what the sri rama chandra taught us it is these he is telling that do you show proper respect to the deities father father like teachers the old physician and then have you engaged high born why high born because they should be noble completely uh not having that uh the family background or ethics and nothing is there they won't be able to serve properly the king they should slowly grow up but already those who are there they know how to behave and how to act with the king so high born valiant they themselves are courageous at the same time they're wise they themselves can take the decision self-control person why self-control so they should not take all the credit they will be going representing the king or they are drafting sometimes majority of our the president of america and the other leaders they are going on attending the meetings of different kinds going on giving the lectures is it possible for any human being to prepare the beautiful lectures like that no they have there the people they are drafting the lectures and giving it to him and there are people who are telling him teaching him how to pronounce this way how to behave so all this but they're at the back of the scene they are nowhere when the leader is going and addressing everybody clapping and the leader is getting the whole credit but it is these counselors only you know good counselors bring success to the ruler sri rama chandra is telling his brother then third he is telling do you entrust responsible works to ministers who are men of character above bribery the all work cannot be done by one person if the king is trying to do everything himself he won't be able to do justice to anything he'll be exhausted so that's why you have to fast trust some people and mainly they are free from bribery that is a dangerous thing at the time of sri ramachandra we always say ram rajat at the time of sri rama the kingdom should be like the the ramachandra's time but that time also people they were taking bribe otherwise why the ramachandra will mention this so when you are entrusting the work to the ministers and you have to give but first thing you have to background check of that person you must check the background of the person whether he is having clear character or not otherwise you should not depend on those the interest responsible works to ministers who are men of character what is the character sadha and krita and that is the character they should have complete dedication for the leader and for the ideology for the country for the motherland and at the same time they are fearless they are not asking for any personal benefit they are the good people to be entrusted with the fourth is asking did you appoint an intelligent high born and devoted warrior as your military general so military journal is also a very important position if we choose a wrong person then naturally he can betray and in the rank and file of the army military there's a very peculiar discipline they don't care even the king not even anyone except the general so they are ready to die at the word of the general if the general is using them for his own benefit sometimes in some country the army queue how it is possible the army never cared for anything who is the government who is the president who is the prime minister if the general says govern attack they will do that that they are trained in that way so obviously the main administrator the king he must be very careful in choosing the very good warrior a civilian if he is in the position of a general he will make lot of mistakes because the army or the soldiers they should be ruled or guided by and one who is himself a warrior having the experience of war knows how to fight out to you because that is the different type of schooling different type of education the sri ramachandra asking his brother why first he asked about the father and mother and then he is going on asking he is inquiring from his brother whether the country is in good hand or not the ramachandra is not irresponsible he is always trying to follow the dharma the righteousness and that is to keeping the promises his father gave the promise his father gave the word to his mother and rama want to keep that promise that must be but at the same time he is also concerned about his own country so he is inquiring from the next person who is going to govern whether he is capable with all these qualities then the fifth he is asking do you pay your army regularly and provide them with their rations in due time look at it so modern way each and every word the sri ramachandra is asking army should be regularly paid if they are worried about their salary and about their ration so naturally they may not because that is the those are the people who are going to give their life offer their life so they that they should be given the all this in in america i have noticed whenever they see their army the first opportunity if you are going for the plane they will announce if the anyone from the armed forces then they will be first given the opportunity to board in the plane so that way they always keep the respect and rama asking do you pay your army regularly and provide them with their rations in due time you know if the if salaries and rations are not given in proper time the employees get annoyed with their master and trouble starts so that is ramachandra's advice to his brother there are so many questions he asked i am i have chosen a few only i am just reading before you and he's asking again do you employ educated citizen intelligent and good in speech as your emissaries the emissaries the ambassadors the ambassadors are going to uh represent the king so obviously the proper person should be engaged so he is telling the educated but good in speech because they have to narrate they have to sometimes you will find some of the ambassadors they're so wonderfully representing friends sometimes we think to what all these things about the dharma the religion it is actually the complete growth sri ramachandra came to establish dharma he is an avatar and it is the duty of the abutara to establish dharma and if the society in turmoil how can one practice dharma so that is the reason rama who was born in a satria family who was a king he was narrating all this as the responsibility of a king the knowledge of a king the quality of a king then he is asking o brother do you gather information regularly through your trusted spies about 18 people who may create problems for the kingdom so the king should have is personal spies so they will bring the information to that only for the kings here and king will listen to them and judge them and king must be very very careful about 18 people in those days so it was the king directly connected so he is telling that the 18 people should be taken care of who are those ministers the spy should go on checking the ministers whom they are meeting because the ministers are taking a lot of decisions so they are meeting so many people king cannot always go so king will know about that minister's movement whether he is telling the truth whether reporting is proper so he is keeping the eye on the minister's activity so he is asking do you have the proper spies intelligent spies to the 18 people minister then the priest priest is a very influential person you know then in the those who have read the history of saviyat rasa that there was a priest and he destroyed the whole kingdom and the same way in the great britain also one priest and this is the way most of the places there will be a priest and in those days every family is to have a priest and priest is having great influence on the owner of the family and how he is behaving how he is influencing how he is changing the mind priest should also be observed properly instead of the religious thing is he indulging with other things so that one should keep an eye on the priest of course the military generals then the warders the warders they are the people who is to look after the everything of the inside the palace so one should be careful about those people superintendent of jail and the conveyors of the royal commands in those days these two announce so the people is to go to village to village hamlet to hamlet everywhere to announce the the king's order are they truly exactly the king's order pronouncing there or maybe mixing their own idea the king said something and they when they reach to the villages far away place where the king doesn't know what is going to happen they will say king has asked that you should pay these you should pay that king you will never know but the civilians they will be against the king so the conveyors nowadays all our media if the media is not properly reporting the thing it becomes really very difficult for the administrators so he is asking that you should get proper information about these people and treasurers those who are keeping the properties judges juries and pay master of salaries the pay masters when you are giving the salaries to the people you are supposing you are giving them one thousand and that man will keep one or two hundred and instead of thousand they will pay 800 that person the receiver the worker he will obviously think what is happening he will criticize the king so this is also the those who are paying the salaries one should be very careful about them distributors of pensions city administrators and rangers of forest magistrate polish law enforcement and chief terms of tribals they should be what the chieftains are thinking how they are behaving all the information keep the king should keep hear apparent those who are going to have the responsibility afterwards are they really good people are they capable people for that particular job so here apparent and guards personal and family guards the king is having the bodyguards they're so close to him any time they do can harm the king so they must be properly chosen see each and everything that the sri ramachandra asking his brother about the administration is just asking you must be so but he is giving him the teaching of administration of a king then the eighth he is asking the question sri rama advised bharata not to get influenced by the false religious teachers sometimes the religious teachers they create habbo they will be influencing the king so one must be very very careful about the false religious teachers and nowadays if we look at the present-day history there's so many people are in trouble all over the world just because of few religious people so-called religious leaders they're thinking that they are properly administering or giving the religious judgment this is wrong so king should be administrator must be very very careful about these people because they are very influential my brother i hope the women of our country are safe under your care do you honor them this is sri ramachandra he is asking his brother he is not a modern day king ramachandra was far before sri krishna even that time honoring the women that was also a great thing for the administration o bharata are the forts well provided with wealth corn water arms artisans and soldiers the kingdom should be protected and the force on the borders they should have all these things so that they can protect the country do the servants approach you fearlessly or they keep themselves away so this is the wonderful questions ramachandra asking if the servants are not very close to the master they may misunderstand in between some people they come in between the king and the servant and this middle people are very dangerous type they influence you cannot get the direct information then the rama is suggesting you see a middle course between too much of familiarity and inaccessibility is good any modern administrator should read this is what i was feeling when i was reading my god so this is ramayana the ramayana he is actually giving the very good administrator and when the kings are very good administration is very good and there everything will be naturally developed and then finally he is asking o king is your income greater than your expenditure the king should have all this in his mind and through these questions and inquiries rama taught administration to his sorry brother bharata who will be ruling the ayodhya for 12 long years on behalf of sri rama this chapter describes how a ruler can be not only successful in administrating but also make a whole country prosperous and strong when sri rama's sri rama stopped by saying now my dear mark my word this is what i wanted to tell you this is the king those who are in the administration and performing their duties properly they will go to heaven this is what the sri rama said mark my word the king the ruler can enjoy the earth and also attain heaven after death by justly governing the people so rama who was an avatar he is giving this instruction bharata said with folded hands o arya i am your brother people and servant ah be pleased with me our father died of grief for you now here the bharata is announcing that his father has passed away rama was not aware he to speak the truth this sinful act has been committed by my mother kiki i was far away and never knew anything about her plan you are the eldest son and you are to be invested with the crown according to custom and morality kindly come back to ayotta and rule like indra the king of gods the bharata after hearing all these he said to sri rama now bharata didn't say anything the queries that the rama was asking why all those qualities that the rama was asking and many more i only mentioned the 12 there may be 32 the sriram rama was asking but here the bharata didn't give answer because he is focused on one mission the mission is to take ramachandra back to ayotta so he is all constant but he has already fulfilled that all those things that the rama was mentioning everything has been fulfilled by bharata beforehand why you know immediately after their marriage they married the four sisters four brothers they married four sisters of the janaka and janaka's brother they were having two two daughters so all the four daughters were given to marriage to these four brothers and after the marriage he went to his maternal along with the maternal uncle to his the maternal grandfather property i mean kingdom decoy and there he ruled for 12 years a part of the kingdom was given to him he became the small little king and he ruled and he learned it in those days the proper teachers were there to give the teaching to these young kings to become a great king so the rulers must be must so that is the the teaching in those days the rishis used to give and sri rama embraced bharata and said how can a man true to his vows do a sinful act just for a kingdom friends can you imagine now for a little money the people are killing their brothers and doing so many bad things but here we find that is the characteristics of the indian culture even for the kingdom they are not going to do anything which is not righteous so rama established dharma and this is the dharma keeping the words he is telling how can a man true to his vows to be a sinful act just for a kingdom moreover don't blame your mother or yourself as a son is supposed to obey the wishes of his father we are only doing that you went with your maternal uncle judajit to the kingdom of kekai and so that is why you did it and do you know why you went over there raj 107. so he said that in the beginning at the time of the marrying your mother kiki king dasharata promised to accept a kingdom as a gift from your maternal grandfather the king of kekai he kept his promise by sending you to learn and mis administration as a king so sri rama knew all this so he is telling look at it in the beginning the father promised to your the grand matter maternal grandfather that i will accept a property from you and he did that that's because he promised and whom he sent the koike's son because that was the quickest father the koike's son that he went over there to accept that property and he became the king he learned how to rule sim dashratha gave to your mother koike who saved his life two promises and when kaike requested him to keep his promises he as a true noble man kept his promises by exa exiling me for 14 years and giving you the ayodhya to rule what is the problem so the rama he is taking it is so simple for him keeping the promise is the dharma the religion is nothing but keeping the promises and those who cannot do that and no character to practice religion this is very important he is mentioning in this way so don't blame yourself oh brother don't blame your mother too because this is according to the promises only the ones our father promised to your the maternal grandfather that he will accept as a rajya shulkam rajya should come in as a gift at the time of marriage a part of the kingdom he's a but i cannot go there the sharatha was a very big king he cannot go to rule that small kingdom and he cannot send any others the representative rather he sent his son and now that he promised to give to the give the words to his mother the who saved his life and then now he is keeping the promise a person should not break the promise because that is dharma now our duties to obey our parents the bharata like a true shatriya who never give up the mission said to sri rama well then let me sit in front of your cottage without food and water till you accept our request this is called praia opaviation operational means sitting and prayer provisioner without any food or water they'll be going on sitting over there as sometimes the fasting people they do and to get some political benefit and their demand there are some people that do even today so that is always there the bharata told i am going to practice that sitting in front of your cottage till you go to ayodhan accept the kingdom rama rebuked him and he said bharata this is the way the brahmanas they do but the shatriyas they never do like this the shatriyas their way is completely different bharata then wanted to promise before the mother the gurus and the seniors to exchange the position of himself and sri rama he said well then ob sri rama i am promising before everyone the father wanted the some of his son should go to the forest for 14 years let exchange the position you better go and become the king and let me go to exile for 14 years then the rama embraced him and with a great lovingly he embraced him and seeing the genuineness of bharata bharati wanted to give everything for sri ramachandra and these last thing that proved you know in those days when you are touching the water touching the fire and in front of your guru and elders do some promise they will never break that promise so varata wanted to do that telling let us change the position in my place both of us are the sons of the sharatha now i will take the position of sri rama and go to exile and rama will take the position of me and will rule the country that much when the rama said no but here this is the last sloka i should end over here by coating see rama was moved so almost in tears all other people surrounded there they were crying and weeping seeing the love between these two great brothers and the great sacrifice that they were doing and they were ready to do for each other but at the same time sri ramachandra was so firm and then he said sri rama seeing the sincerity embraced bharata but at the same time in a formed thunderous voice 112 to 18 that these verses will continue lakshmi's chandra api maybe the moon will stop shining maybe the himalaya without any snow maybe the ocean become a desert but my word given to my father will never break so that is called dharma and that is sri ramachandra sri rama he never ever broke his promises so friends what we learned today from the ramayana balmiki ramayana there are many others ramayana they have not mentioned all these things the balmiki has given so the if you find the balmiki ramayana so all these wonderful practical teachings the how a king should behave and king should rule the country there are many things to learn really and if we really follow sri ramachandra's words like this there will be no difficulty no problem in administration at the same time we cannot but appreciate the beautiful minds of both the brothers the bharata he knew that as a elder brother sri rama should be the king so he was trying his best and rama knew if i break one promise then in the whole world in the posterity the people will say look at rama he also broke his promise so what is there to keep the promise why you should so those thing which one has said once should be must be kept then lastly what happened you all know ramayana is very famous ultimately the varatha the great bharata he gave the the two shoes to rama one pier and you better put your the holy peat over here oh brother i will take this and keep it on the throne and as a representative of sri ramachandra i will rule the country for 14 years and i will wait for you for 14 years and when you come back after the 14 years i will give back the land to you rama agreed to that so the paducah paducah means the shoe the rama he touched that and bharata very with great honor kept that on the back of an elephant and they all went back the sri rama told see my brother you rule for 14 years ayota and let me be in the in the forest for 14 years never come to to see me i'll be all right and rama knew that he has a mission to fulfill even the gods also came down to remind the rama and bharata because they knew rabana should be killed that was the planning of the gods and if the rama go back then how the rabbanu will be killed so all the plannings are there so they said o bharata you should be satisfied now so please go back and become the king and as a representative of the sri rama rule the country and o rama now you live in these jungle happily now in a jungle how can you be happy because mentally if we are happy wherever we live is the happiness the long back when i was very young novice brahmacari i told a senior monk that time he was in charge of the singapore so i was serving him washing his clothes and keeping the room clean and serving some tea coffee food so then i told swamiji when you were strolling and i told swamiji i like to go to himalaya and sit in a cave and meditate then he said a beautiful word i always remember remember he said remember it is not the place but the people with whom you are living that is very important the if you think that in himalaya you'll be happy you may not be you do not know the next uh maybe nearby you know all the caves are occupied by the monks but then the next cave may be another person he too a monk but maybe different type he may disturb you all the time and that is there i have seen it is not the place but the people with whom you are living that is very important so with whom we are living rama gave that and two brothers they made and we heard and wonderful teachings of rama and learned that we should be ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of righteousness dharma so let us say shanti three times and we conclude o mushanti [Music] it you
