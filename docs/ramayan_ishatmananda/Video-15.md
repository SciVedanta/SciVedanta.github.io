[Ramayana 015 - “Surpanakha meets Sri Rama and Lakshmana”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3ayzSceCyo)

crucial it is a beautiful story but at the same time as a we we learn so much the social and economical and historical uh the pictures of of those days the letters begin with the our s m the husband of the sita that is sri ramachandra we are offering our pranam to him so this rama is the god himself he has come to establish the dharma so that is the main purpose when the avatar comes when the god comes in the human form we call them avatara incarnation they come with only one purpose to establish the righteousness to establish the dharma now sri rama came and how he was establishing the dharma by following the words the words that has been given to someone that the resolution that has been taken so keeping those and that is the reason sri rama he was in exile and for 14 years and we were going through all that slowly slowly and now after the rama mate agusta the great rishi he suggested you better give go to panchavati and those who know the ramayana they know this is a very famous the from there only the whole ramayana began then that the rama started going to panjabati at one way he made a huge person under the disguise of a bird and when the rama thought who is this is another rakshasa then but without challenging he went and asked said who are you then he said i am the son of binatha that that is garuda the binatas that is my mother is binata and your father was my friend so we can understand now most of us we like to depict this jatayu as a bird but how can a bird be like that he was a great sage he was meditating on god he was performing his duties but wearing the dress like a bird so in those days the clans were there the people were there who is to wear the dresses like the monkey like the bear and like the birds so we discussed that this is a the a clan who is to worship the great birds and they were known as jatayu so this jatayu and his brother was also there he mentioned about that they were the but one thing he never mentioned about the father he mentioned about the mother he said i am the son of binata so this is also something to notice something to learn in those days nowadays the people once again they are fighting the particularly the mothers why every time we have to tell the father's identity with the mother's identity also children can be ah admitted in the school and then can grow in that way why not a majority of the advanced country they have accepted it and look at it in that ancient india it was that and jatai you never mentioned that who is was father and we know the afterwards in the at the time of the upanishad there also a little boy he went to get him admitted in the school when he was asked what is the name of your father he said i don't know the name of my father but my mother is so and so and that way he was introduced he became afterwards the great rishi so this is the custom was there system was there the jatai you then told the rama asked can you please tell us the what are these things the creation now a bird is giving them in details the creation how the creation came how the supreme lord created brahma from the brahma these these these this and last time we were discussing then ultimately that two the mother aditi and dt where from the good and the bad came aditi and diti aditi became the mother of the gods and deity became the mother of the demons but from the same father so obviously the attitude of the mother teachings of the mother influence of the mother that is always inspires the children the mother was not that way good so harsan became a surah and mother aditi became the mother of the devas the surah or surah that means they were not enlightened the surah and ah all means negative surah means enlightenment the light the knowledge and all surah all means negative to opposite so they were brothers they were cousins but at the same time from the same father two mothers according to our influences these two different generations started so who were the rakshasas the same because they were from the deity so this way they learn from this great bird and i think a little we have discussed in the in our last class so rama started after asking that you better protect our sita and he offered his service the great bird the huge bodied man dressed like a bird i prefer to say like this that he told if you need any service i can give you the service though i am elderly but i can do that then the rama and lakshmana are told you better protect mother sita and let us go inside the panchavati and let us start one their heart over there construct a heart so rama went over there and asked the lakshmana we are a princess the king's children we don't know the carpentry lakshmana told no i know i can do it and rama was delighted to know about that is it then it is wonderful then he told rama you just select a site a place where we can construct drama selected and rama knew that water should be nearby and there should be a clean place so that we can understand where the animals are coming so like that like that he calculated and the fruit tree should be nearby so that we can go and plug the fruits so all these he can considered and then selected a place and lakshmana almost in no time went and cut the the trees and made all these logs and he constructed a nice beautiful cottage for them so it took some days but it's almost in no time that means in a very short period of time and he was a very strong person and he could work like that rama became so happy so very happy and he told the that you are very intelligent the one of the verses i am not quoting the words it says o lakshmana that he embraced the brother and said you are very intelligent you are the bhabhagya and you are krita the grateful intelligent bhabha and at the same time grateful krita why krita because he is serving sri rama the rama was his elder brother and that's why he said elder brother is just like the father and i must serve the father he was going on serving him and rama was very happy the god was very happy and he said you are krita at the same time you are dharma see and who is a very good human whom god love if we are having these qualities and we think that if we retire in a solitude and sit alone just meditating not talking with people not mixing with anyone and i will become a very purified person in the beginning it is okay to withdraw the mind to control the senses it is okay but the religion is nothing but transformation transformation into what transformation into the good qualities so the three rama when appreciating his young brother lakshmana he is using three three words one is you are bhabha o lakshmana you are intelligent a devotee should not be a fool bhagavan sirama krishna also said when he asked his young disciple to go and purchase some utensils for him from the calcutta market he went and he was a rich man's son he never knew how to uh in the shopping when you are going over there you should be careful about the thing and you have to if necessary you have to talk with the the shopkeeper and if whatever the cheapest way it is possible you have to you know he never knew that he went over there in a very you know that as a devotees away simple straightforward he said this is for my guru who is the priest in the dakshinesha can you please give me a good quality and some utensils and the shopkeeper immediately understood the documentation is far away from calcutta they won't be able to bring it back in return and he said oh yes yes and gave a secondhand thing which was not good and also there was some defect was there in that utensil when this boy brought that to bhagavan sri ramakrishna sram krishna immediately ah saw that notice that defect and told how come the defect is there you did didn't notice you should notice it you should when you are purchasing you should be careful then he used the word when you are a devotee doesn't mean you should be a fool that people can cheat you the devotee should be very intelligent here the rama is appreciating his brother by telling you are intelligent some other meanings are also there but i prefer to you to use this as an intelligent and he knew what to do and how to do and all these things he learned also when he was learning different things so he learned the carpentry he learned how to construct so he was very intelligent and he utilized this knowledge for the service of god so krita the dharma means it makes a man humble so when he was drama told please go and construct a heart for us i'm tired i like to take rest you could make it just 30's house but no he knew the rama the prince he you the you'd be the king of the whole country so naturally he should be in a proper house and moreover they are going to stay there permanently so that was the planning so he planned in that way and prepared that constructed that room in that way so he said at the same time he asked rama i am not going to decide which place we are going to build this house cottage you better say why because rama is the master and i am the servant that humbleness completely free from ego though confident though capable but free from ego friends devotees we should learn this from ramayana so when we are reading ramayana it is the scriptural book the obviously through the stories the most of us we know the stories so sometimes we feel it oh all we all know this it is not necessary but analyzing this one or two at the points that we must understand this is very very important and from here we understand the why he was appreciating lakshmana you are the bhagavad-gita you are the krita and you are the dharma righteous then he said you are truly the representative of our father dasaratha and seeing you i don't think our father has passed away all the great qualities of our father is within you so he is giving the respect a younger brother but the sri rama is giving the respect of a father he said i see that all the good qualities manifested in you and you are as if our father so by that way they then the rama went to the river bathed nicely and they came back and had some dinner and went inside the room with the sita to take rest lakshmana he never entered inside inside the room he was sitting outside and on guard because the rama and sita they are taking rest there should not be any trouble the whole night he used to walk before that and go surrounding that cottage and protecting them and very alert that is called dharmakya he knew that rama is not only my brother rama is god himself so i am protecting means i am serving my god and when i am serving my god i don't feel tired rather i am elated then i am getting the opportunity to serve my god so he is to go round and protect yet the rama and lakshmana made the surpri then many of us we know the story of surprise in this wind all these things were all right slowly the atom autumn came and the beautiful the the flowers and the fruits and the birds and they were enjoying their lives staying over there but suddenly one lady from the different clan that's called rakshasa came over there and when he saw the rama he went straight to rama and say i like to marry you i like you though you are having the matted hair dirty clothes not that of of a noble ah the dress but still i can understand the seeing you that you are not a ordinary person so i like to marry you friends here we think we should try to know the culture of those days in those days girls were free they could choose their husband and anyone they chose and they could go and tell their parents all the elders that i liked this person i like to marry him they were completely free and afterwards also before the the invasions of the earth foreigners from the other country to india there were the system of that the the princes and the ladies the the girls particularly they used to go to the market or the the the boys who were ready to the young people ready for marriage this to come and assemble in one place and the girl will go and choose her husband it's known as tryambara swayambhara is choosing her own the husband she is choosing her own husband so that is a system afterwards and before that at the time of rama so it was the girls were free ladies were free to go to people so she came without hesitation when we read now and most of our books and other places we always condemn them that she was last full she was bad but in reality that was the system so custom so she never hesitated and she was the sister of ravana the king so obviously we can understand she was not an ordinary lady she was also from the very high birth the ravana was a brahmana ravana was highly qualified ramachandra himself appreciated ravana for his knowledge and he was a the worshiper of lord siva he got the blessings of shiva his brothers were also well placed people so naturally she came and then she then the rama narrated everything when she asked who are you then then rama told our father was the sharatha and these these these things have happened now this is my wife janaki sita and i am now living in this forest for few days with her i cannot marry you because i am already having my wife now then she noticed lakshmana who were stand sitting and in a little distance so she went to lakshmana and he told then you are not having your wife the lakshmi was married but he didn't bring his wife into that forest so lakshmana told i am already married but i am not interested to marry you then jokingly the lakshmana said hey i will give you an idea see any the shatria can marry two three times now ma janaki is already there srita is there you better go back to sri ramachandra and say because your first paper is rama you better go and say lord marry me i am ready to become your wife second wife here again the simple lady we can understand she told no i like to marry you why should i have to go and become the second lawyer i will like marry you then lakshmana said do you know why because i am the servant of sri rama do you also like to be a servant all through i am going to be the servant of sri rama all this he was telling the lakshmana was telling jokingly but the poor lady couldn't understand the joke then she thought suppose i kill that lady the wife of sri rama then obviously after killing her i can become the first wife of rama and thinking that she attacked la sita rama as a husband was always very protective of his wife and that is the dharma of the husband always should be ready to protect the wife so the sri rama immediately stopped that lady and told don't come near musita then i will kill you then he rebuked lakshmana you should not have agitated al saying like this don't cut jokes in this way they don't understand she has taken it very seriously but anyway to stop her give her some punishment lakshmana without thinking and without wasting time she cut the nose of the surprise also the ears so obviously the physical pain then the insult and the the blood flowing like that she went back crying and cursing to he her brother who was also rabano was our brother at the same time there her other brothers were also nearby they were sarah and do shana they were the kings of that the rulers of that place so she first went to the shara and told the shara my brother i have been insulted by these two human being and because this this thing happened and though i mentioned that i belong to the family of rabana but they didn't hesitate to deform me like this now all through my life i will be suffering i want you my brother to go and avenge and you must take the the punish them also so obviously he became very angry the shura and the shara then saying are 14 generals very powerful soldiers to punish these two human being so for them they were the rakshas was very physically powerful so they thought it is nothing they sent the 14 generals and the 14 generals came and the rama when he saw that these people are coming so they came on the chad ears on the heart's back and all these weaponries then the rama told lakshmana will you please protect sita for a short period of time see this is the responsibility of the husband the rama understood lakshmana alone may not be able to fight with them and moreover they are coming to attack me and my wife so obviously this is my responsibility to go and fight as a shatriya we have to understand in those days there was no police there was no law the people have to protect themselves so obviously rama understood that he could ask lakshmana to go and fight but he didn't why because why i should ask my brother to take the risk i will go so he said so here is the dharma so whenever there is a difficulty we try to put the other people on our behalf he said no it my dharma that it is my as a husband i am supposed to protect my wife and i am going to protect by killing them by punishing them but can you please on my behalf protect sri srita lakshmana took up the bow and arrow and sat over there and said well brother whatever you say i will follow and he started protecting masita rama went a few steps and when they came near at ease that he knew different type of style of war at ease he killed all the 14 almost in no time that from one bow he when he was shooting as if he was shooting the 14 arrows at a time so so sweet and so fast and so and so this is the way that he actually i'm sorry so this is the way he uh killed the 14 generals and surprise also accompanies those generals to enjoy the punishment 14 generals powerful warriors and very forceful when they were coming supernaka was sure that these two brothers are going to be punished in their hand but when she noticed that in no time rama killed the 14 she went back rushing rushed back to her brother sarah and another brother do shana they both were there and told so this is the way that man has killed this fourteen the shara was not ready to believe what do you say the one person without any fight just killed the 14 generals my so favorite people then he told no it we should be ready to fight and he declared a full war and all the soldiers 5 000 soldiers under the shara and dusana and other generals they all went to that and he encouraged let us go quickly he cried we have to go and kill them so they came over there then naturally then don't delay anymore march quick and kill this two brothers that was the war cry when they all came rama saw the hundreds and thousands of the horses the elephants the chariots and the armed people they are coming only two brothers then the rama told lakshmana please be careful and very careful in protecting sita and he went little away from the cottage because he knew if they attacked the cottage and that will be difficult for the protection of the sita so he went out to meet them and when they came they saw not two but only one person three rama standing alone and they could notice the that the cottage also the rama took up his bow and arrow and he was having the blessings of all the gods and all the celestial beings they came they assembled over there and they were praying for the victory of sri rama why because rama was the dharma rama was the righteousness so rama was getting the blessings and the prayer of the celestial being and the gods and demigods and these demons when they were coming they could feel that something is wrong then someone was telling my right hand is throbbing it's not a good the omen you shall you stop today some other day we'll go oh let us go and talk to that person instead of attacking but these two brothers as because the shurpunaka was going on crying and showing that how she was punished she told brothers see unless you kill them i am not satisfied to satisfy the sister the two brothers five thousand soldiers they all came to attack srirama now the description in the ramayana it says that as the the rain fall from the sky and cover everything sri rama took off his divine bow and from the weaver which is always full because it was indra's weaver you may be remembering that one of the rishis it gave that to sri rama and the quiver was always filling up with the arrows ramo was using the arrows and always it was filled up that was the the magical that was the divine and they were having very sharp arrows and with different sizes the rama was going on shooting the and killing the elephants and the horses she wanted that they should fall on the ground and standing on the ground if you are fighting naturally ram get the benefit so he was doing like that he was moving swiftly from one place to another and were throwing the aloes and he noticed that some of the people they are going towards the cottage so they wanted to attack another brother but at the same time the rama noticed while fighting noticed that lakshmana secretly took the sita and put her inside a cave and stood over there protecting the door of the cave rama became satisfied and he understood now they won't be able to touch sita and he concentrated in the war and the description says like the arrows were falling down on these 5000 soldiers as the rain falls from the sky and slowly slowly all they were dying and in a very wonderful way excellent way though they were having the protections but the throats were open and rama was targeting those throats and how sure when in the field when when what is going on that means he was so well trained so he was targeting those places where there was no protection otherwise they were covered with the arms you know everywhere so where rama will pierce the arrow so this is the description of the war and then he took out the valmiki ramayana giving the description he took out the one type of the arrow which was not sharp but having a crescent on the top and it threw it at the shoot it towards the shara and shara fell from his elephant in the beginning he was on the chariot the chariot was killed destroyed then he he was using the elephant sitting on the top of the elephant when he was fighting with rama he was in a very good position but the now the rama killed him over there the elephant also was killed and from that huge elephant the shadow fell down and he became injured almost dead the dusana again came and his brother sarah's and he used in the ramayana it is mentioning a formidable parigha formidable means that was not allowed in the war when the war the in india they always said that everything should be legally that there should be a system even in the war you are not supposed to kill the person who is not having the the weapon the person with the weapon then you can attack you can fight but though they were attacking one person with so many that was not correct at the same time when he saw his brother sarah he fell from their elephant back and died the dusana took up the formidable arm which was not allowed and what is that pariga the name of that weapon in the note of the book they say pariga was like our present day the gun it could throw the fire and as because you are fighting with a person who is not having that weapon he is only having the bow and arrow and the sword so you can use those weapons to attack the why you are using the pariga pariga is the type of weapon that could throw the fire and that was formidable even in those days you should not use that but he used that but even then when the pariga he threw the when he was coming to fire to the rama very swiftly rama shot two arrows and cut both the hands of this dushana when the dusana was not having the hands naturally he could not at the shoot that fire could not fire they could not fire the tigger so he fell down like a log of wood this is up to that everything was over again that lady she understood this person is very powerful and about these brothers won't be able to punish them but now what we feel she could stop over there she could understand because of me two of my brothers and five thousand soldiers but for no reason just for me i was crying and they came and they died for me now it is enough is enough i should go and beg at sri ramachandran and say please don't kill them anymore it is okay i am sorry whatever has happened ram would have give them the okay you better go back but know that this lady again went to his elder brother rabana and when she went to the rabana in sri lanka ravana was a very very powerful king and all they knew him and went and described everything instead of sending the soldiers to fight the rama what the ravana did was called politics and he understood he was rama was not an ordinary person he was having the divine the capacity divine power divine armaments and to fight with him i must have to understand his power his strength his support and i have to understand the weakness of my enemy and then only it will be possible so he then planned when he heard all details about sri ramachandra from his sister shulpanaka he understood sita is the weak point of srirama somehow if we abduct the sita then the rama will come to our place and on our own place it will be easy to kill the enemy and moreover if we are abducting the sita that he will be weak because he will be naturally going on searching without any friend and where he will go and if physically mentally he will be weak it will be easy for me when the rama saw that lakshmana very carefully and intelligently kept inside the cave kept the sita inside the cave and protecting and you know he knew that there is no problem for the sita lakshmana is capable to protect her and these people also cannot throw weapons too hard to injure her or to kill her so he rama could concentrate the luck the rabbana immediately understood when he heard the whole is the description of the war and then he understood i must have to take revenge but at the same time i should not hurry or rush towards ramachandra the friends i think we should stop over here the this is the whole story goes this is the the ramayana means rama and ravana war why the rama and rabana because again we will say because of the prestige and this lady should punaka if she could say well i understand and could control her emotion then everything would have been all right if the lakshmana had not just joked with her and unnecessarily he told that you better go and become the second wife of the rama then i think it would not have happened but that was the divine wish the thing should happen like that but we will understand the very excellent policy of rabana the rabbani was doing very bad thing but at the same time in the politics how do they behave of course it is always better to be always in the path of the righteousness the dharma the sri rama is always following the dharma and we learned here what is dharma keeping the promises and what are the promises first his father gave the promise to our mother whatever she will ask the two boons the two prayers his father told i will give it to you and then because of some many reason that we know and we have already discussed the two were first the banishment of dharma and establishing the harsan bharata as the king rama came only to keep the promise of his father and this is dharma and secondly the dharma to protect the wife here also we will find sri rama never give up the hope and constantly bearing all pains only to keep the righteousness only to follow the righteousness and that is that protecting his wife and thirdly we will come across that we gave the word to another person and became friends and to save the framed he also killed the another the great warrior bali all the stories and through the stories this moral values spiritual values we will understand we will learn and we will continue i am thinking by that we should continue up to the december then after the december we can pick up some other book if you like to continue so let us complete the ramayana since we have already come to the main story of the ramayana so thank you friends thank you if you have any question you can ask or we will say the shanti three times and we'll stop sarda buddhabhi hi thanks swamiji i guess uh we don't have any questions okay so let us say shanti three times shanti [Music] foreign
