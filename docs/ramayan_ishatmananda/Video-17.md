[Ramayana 017 - “Abduction of Sita.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZjaJE2Ua20)

are now let us begin our ramayana study so as usually as we do let us chant on the ramayana and then we will start look at [Music] i now this is the prayer that we usually do to bhagavan sri ramachandra after this prayer let us begin in the last month in june we read that the only one survival of among the 14 000 rakshasa he came to ravana to report that was the janasthana war the janasthana war that only sri ramachandra alone he fought against the 14 000 rakshasa and he killed them now when we read like this we may think is it possible for one person to kill so many people and armed people and they were also powerful how it is possible so when we read that the sri ramachandra had the capacity to shoot the arrows very swiftly the people even couldn't see his hand moving from the quivers to the bow and going back to keywords it was so fast and that was the reason and in one time the they could some some of them the ramo was also very highly trained the person so he could shoot nearly four to five arrows at a time and it was very sweeped and the target and the it was each and every arrow is to kill the the one the by that way it was really very powerful now the only survival this akampana this name is akampana and very sarcastically akampana means he is not shivering but truly he was shivering kampana company shivering and he came to ravana and he reported to rabana that everyone has been killed and by sri rama and lakshmana these two brothers and he was requesting ravana not to go against rirama because from his experience he said that all the great fighters our warriors they were no match for these two brothers so it is better not to go over there once again the ravana and he was also very arrogant person he was also very powerful and at that moment in those days he was the one of the excellent warrior ravana and he defeated even the indra the king of all gods all other gods they were defeated so obviously he had great pride and confidence in his own mind so that is the way he was thinking but this akampana this the he saw them and from his own experience he was telling not to go fight against or develop anonymity with these two brothers rabbana didn't pay any heed and he rode to a to his uncle maricha now this murica he was also rakshasa but he was practicing austerity and very in the ramayana it says that he used to meditate and meditate on sri ramachandra rakshasa he is meditating on sri ramachandra and when he was killed that we will come to that story then he was meditating on sri rama so he went to the ravana he went to marija why because murica was his uncle and murica had a special power and that is yogic power supernatural power he could change at any moment and to any form that was his unique power the ravana secretly went to him and he said the o murica i am indeed in great difficulty ravana was so powerful and when he is telling that i am in difficulty that means murica understood that this is something very very serious so i am in great difficulty and you are the only person who can help me so i have come to disturb you so i know that you are practicing austerity but still i like to take your help and this also shows one more thing that the rakshasas are were also practicing spiritual austerities they knew it so when you were withdrawing your saints organs from the saints objects what are the saints objects the rupa russia shabdas parshaganda whatever we see that is an object and we hear we smell we touch we taste all these are objects and what happens our pancha gyanendriya this indriyas our saints organs they go out contact these five objects and bring back the information to the mind that is the that is the process it goes on so naturally that we can't understand that what is happening we get bound by this now if we want the spiritual power the only thing that we have to practice with withdrawing the saints organs from the saints objects and it is applicable for each and every one and in every time all the time in the time of ramacandra and that time also the rakshasas they are also practicing that and practicing my dad to be ravana got blessings and he became so powerful but the problem is those who are practicing if they are not of swathic type so their object of the practice will be to get some power the money the position and all that and they will achieve that they will get that but ultimately everything will be lost and everything will go away that we see in the life of sri ravana and the maricha also the marucha practiced maricha got some blessings from brahma and by that way he became very powerful he could change his form but he used those powers not for the benefit of others but to destroy others and by that way even the blessings of god was also destroyed now he went to the marijuana and he said oh uncle i have come to you because i am in great difficulty and you are the only person who can save me you must have heard by this time that i have lost my two brothers they are kara and kara and dusana they were so ferocious and they were so powerful and these two brothers they died not only that three shira you have heard that name the shira we have already discussed about them and before so all the three they have been killed by rama and lakshmana and not only that along with this three great heroes he has killed fourteen thousand uh the rakshasas and by that way almost the whole the jungle there is no rakshasa now see apple is the who all our civilization over there that particular place which were under our control and our three the rulers were there do shira all these heroes were there they used to rule over there and these two brothers not only killed them they killed all people living over there rakshasas so we have to somehow kill these two brothers but as per the information that i collected they are really difficult to fight with so we have to lure them and bring them to my country sri lanka where my power is so much all people are mine so if we can somehow bring them to sri lanka and naturally they won't get any support in sri lanka then we can easily kill them so that was the rabbana's plan oh uncle you are not only very powerful or warrior you are also a wizard can take different forms at your will take the form of a golden deer and tempt sita now he collected all this information from his different people and also from his sister who was the main cause of all this trouble the surprise she was insulted by the lakshmana and because of that the ravana became angry now it has become a personal the thing that why they should show their power i am the mightiest even the indra cannot fight with me and we're this too ordinary human being so that was the thought of the ravana and he was going on thinking in that way and but he calculated that if we can somehow bring him to our place and they will be weak and we can naturally kill them so that is the this is the planning that he was having and he said to his uncle as because you are having this power to take the different forms you take a form of a golden deer and as because the shita will be tempted the gold india is something new so naturally the ladies they are they like the gold and if it is a golden deer the shita will be tempted and request the rama and usually this type of request the husbands will never say no so let us try in that way when the rama and lakshmana are out so you have to make in such a way the plan in such a way both the brothers should be out and shita will be all alone then it will be easy for me to abduct r from there and slowly slowly they will come to know that shita is in lanka and they will come to sri lanka and we will kill them that is the rabbana's plan but when he was talking like this the this is the plan then the marijuana became very much afraid his face became black the maricha he said the i knew three rama when he was much younger you know what happened my experience i don't know whether i you know it or not he was telling to ravana o king [Music] listen to my experience when i was young i was very strong you know and i was having a huge number of followers rakshasas and i used to roam from one forest to another forest and used to punish all these other rishis and that was my play that was my game and no no one was there to challenge me then one that i found that rishi bashist vishwamitra rishi bishamitra he is organizing the sacrificial fire so when i came to know about the vishamitra's the puja so i decided that i will go and destroy it with a big number of followers i went over there and i found the very young boy who was not having any even the beard was not grown that means you can understand hardly 12 to 13 years old that young boy two brothers they were guarding the rama was the main and he was very good looking very uh it seems that he was gentle kind so i never penny heat to him but this young boy will do to me i the maricha so powerful so without carrying him who was guarding the astama door i just entered into the astama and was rushing towards the particular place where they were arranging the fire worship then this young boy he shot his arrows to me will you believe they didn't kill me but took me lifted me physically and took me a great distance and threw me in the water the rama never wanted to kill me otherwise i would have been killed that moment he simply threw me through the power of his arrows and he was so swift when he was moving i never could notice that he is going to attack me this is my experience and then all my followers were killed by that young boy and now that boy has become a young man more powerful physically and more experienced in using the weapons do you think it will be advisable to go and fight with him who could kill now recently you are reporting that three of your brothers are killed and 14 000 the rakshasas are also slain by these two brothers do you think it will be wise to fight with them so don't take this opportunity don't take this chance don't make this mistake and you better think in a different way how to punish them but the ravana the arrogant person he as he was he said no i am not going to listen to you uncle i have come to request you it doesn't mean it is a request my request as a king my request is a command and you must follow that no one can go against the king's command you do it or i am going to kill you this moment itself if you go and tame to the sita and then take out the rama and lakshmana out of that place from that astrama then it will be easy for me to abduct the sita from there i am not going to fight there in their own field so it will be easy for me to abduct that lady if you do it maybe that you will survive but if you don't do it i'm going to kill you this moment choice is yours now this is the way the lord's rule or we can say the power that acts when someone is going to suffer the first thing that happened he developed tremendous ego and a great desire to achieve something the ego mixed with the desire makes him mad he pays no heed to any good advices in the bhagavad-gita the lord is telling what i do i don't give any gift to anyone don't bless anyone and i don't curse also anyone so i am completely neutral i don't do all this it is your mistake but when i am happy with someone what i do i give him the right type of intellect buddhi yogam dada maham i give him the right type of intellect and by that way he can decide what i should do so many of you know that just before the mahabharata war the arjuna and duryodhana both of them they went to invite krishna and the krishna was lying down this is a very famous story in the mahabharata and from here we can learn that if you have the complete faith in the power of god and the your intellect is also dedicated to god your decision will be perfect so aruna and the duryodhana both of them they were waiting because krishna was taking rest both of them they were waiting where the krishna was sleeping then he got up from that sleep he first saw arjuna and said what's the matter part why you are here and he said that i have come to invite you in this the that war that is we are going to have and then he saw when he turned his face the drujadan also what's the matter to you also the same thing i have come to invite you then the krishna see how he is handling the situation he told look i am one i cannot go to both but i have very highly trained soldiers so if you want you can take all my soldiers they're well equipped highly trained soldiers in one side and another side i alone and i'm not going to fight i'm not going to take up arms against anyone because both of you are my very close i am not going to kill any of you i am not going to fight i am not going to use the arms in one side and in another side all my soldiers now you your choice now first arjuna should ask that duryodhana was protesting now why i came fast and i was sitting over here you didn't notice me that is not my fault because the duryodhana was afraid arjuna will surely take all the soldiers and they're inviting for the war and what i'm going to take do with the krishna that too without any war and he is not going to fight for me so that was the thoughts of the duryodhana but the krishna told since i have seen arjuna i like to give him the first opportunity to choose between me and my soldiers now here those who have read mahabharata and heard this story you know bhutti yogam dadam maham arjuna had bad blessings from the god and he had great faith in the capacity of krishna and he used to consider krishna as his best friend at that juncture he didn't do any mystic instead of all those highly trained well-equipped soldiers he chose krishna he told krishna i want you i don't want the soldiers he had the confidence as a warrior i can fight but as a friend be with me and guide me krishna was very happy druru jadhanu was also very happy and he thought oh arjuna is such a fool but then afterwards when the war was over duru jadhana understood and we also that if you take the god with you all power is yours they hear also when the murica from his experience he understood that rama is not an ordinary person so he are being he attacked rama and rama punished him but didn't kill him and after that he started practicing austerity and for giving up all those bad habits and he advised rabana just like duryodhana ravana was not ready to accept any good advices and he asked him to follow his order and what to do the murica then and there took that changed his form and became a golden deer there is a beautiful description description of the how was his body and the hoof and each and everything that wonderful very attractive deer and in that way he went to near the cottage where the rama shita lakshmana were leaving and he was as a animal he was jumping here and there eating this thing that thing only to attract the attention of the sita who was out over there to pluck the flowers for the evening puja evening arati and when she noticed it in that beautiful afternoon and that type of glittering the golden the deer he she immediately called sri rama and told o rama i want that golden deer now this story there is one say the chintamani binayak i got that reference from the book of the one of our swamiji and he is mentioning no it was not the swami gita nandaji's book he is mentioning that chintamani binayak in his research he mentioned this particular incident was not there in the original balmy kiramayan and why because chintamani binah the he is giving the argument that sita asks the rama and rama knowing that it is not possible a deer cannot be made of golden that is not possible how rama can make that mistake it is not possible and not only that this is the first thing rama chased that only to please the sita the the golden the deer now he asked before leaving the cottage the lakshmana please protect sita because there are many rakshasas around anyone may come politic the sita and now this story goes in this way the marijuana who took the golden deer form he was running very fast and he wanted the ram should come following him a little distance from the place where they are why because ravana is hiding and when the rama will go out and lakshmana will after some time will also go it will be easy for will rabana to abduct the sita so that was the plan rama he chased and at one point of time he shot that deer and while dying this the marija he was actually a rakshasa so he was having the only a form he was not originally any deer so when he was dying he cried out oh lakshmana oh shita i am dying the shita heard it and immediately asked lakshmana the rama is in great danger please go and help him there the lakshmana told mother don't worry about it no one in this world can heart rama you you need not to worry about it this is all some people are behaving like that it is all rakshasas behaving like that i cannot go away leaving you alone over here unprotected moreover rama has asked me not to go away from here i must protect you and for that i will be here the shita because of her emotion and fear for the rama and she started crying bitterly and abusing lakshmana in the beginning she told you are afraid to go over there and you don't know how to fight and that way as a as a shatriya if you say you are afraid and you are weak so this is a great insult for the shatriyas they are military their clans so this type of words are very very insulting for them the lakshmana even then he was going on bearing that thinking rama asked me not to leave so he was going on protecting staying there but then finally when the shita complained it is they say is doubted whether shita did like that or not but in some of the ramayanas and afterwards another proliferation some of the things had been added that they say shita used very bad languages and say to lakshmana i know why you are not going to help your brother and you want that rama should die then you can take me as your wife when she said that it was unbearable for lakshmana lakshmana never even saw sheeta she saw only the feet of the sita she he never looked at sheeta she he was not knowing how she looks only he used to look at the feet of the sita and moreover he used to consider sita as his mother and when that lady told this type of word it became unbearable for lakshmana and he wanted to go from there now again another the story that we read that is also doubtful and the swami gita nanda ji maharaj mentioned tirthi bhasi ramayana kirtivas is from bengal he wrote a ramayana and copying from the original the balmiki ramayana and you know in the hindi belt also those speak hindi they read another ramayana very famous that is goswami tulsidash ramayana that is also the the tulsidasi he depicted the rama in in a different way in his own way but in tulsidas ramayana this incident is there but very mild way because he was a devotee he never wanted to say this type of thing so very mild way he mentioned yes the this thing happened the golden deer came rama chased because srita wanted to get that beast and this thing but in the original ramayana it was not there and that is the opinion of the chintamani pinayaka his argument is now why shita who also knew about the power of sri rama should say like that maybe the golden deer came shita got tempted it may be the weakness and then rama chased and if the rama is over there she knew the power of rama one who killed fourteen thousand rakshasas only the other day and she was the witness of that how she could think that rama is going to die because of some one thing but anyway maybe the the devoted wife she was agitated this is one second the language that the shita used it is unthinkable because shita was the greatly trained and educated and very cultured lady the usually the cultured people never use any filthy bad languages now how shita could say like that second third when the rama and lakshmana both were away then the shita found that a brahmana is approaching for alms and that was rabana but whatever shita was not knowing that that was the ravana and she thought this is a brahmana and she started talking with the brahmana and brahmana told who are you why you are here and she told that my husband has come over here the he is the prince of ayuda and his brother lakshmana has come both of them they have come to hunt for the deer and all this how a lady who was so agitated and she was worrying about the well-being of her husband can immediately become calm and composed and sitting with a person talking with him and giving the whole history of her life no that is absurd it cannot be so he suggested it was the normal thing normal routine for these two brothers to go for collecting food hunting they were shaktriyas so obviously they used to eat meat and other things maybe they went for hunting as it was the normal usually they used to go and ravana came in under the disguise of brahmana to beg it is very natural which is very normal it is possible and naturally sheetha and she came out to give the alms and the ravana was asking different questions etc and this is natural now about that special the circle that he made the mystical power in that circle the lakshmana put around that cottage and asked mother shrita not to cross that circle that is also added and that was only in the kriti vashi ramayana so the bengal is they think talk about it the lakshmana gandhi they say lakshmana gandhi means the circle of the lakshmana one should not cross that and if you cross you are in difficulty so this type of so this is a very old scripture ramayana is a very old scripture obviously and as because all the devotees here reading it so they think that sometimes proliferations some adding and subtraction it goes on but whatever the main story the rabbana came at that moment when rama was out and lakshmana was also out then the rabana came and he forcefully took shita and was leaving and it continues in this way when the rama saw the lakshmana he immediately asked him how calm that you have left shita alone now when we talk about sri rama who is the embodiment of god how come that he couldn't understand so this is a question rama being the god himself could he not understand that something wrong is going to happen he knew it so they say rama when he saw that golden deer he understood the time has come to complete his mission what is his mission his mission was to punish the ravana and and along with the ravana all the bad people so why because as in the bhagavad-gita we find the god is taking that oath whenever the unrighteousness will be in will be increased i will come and take the form of the human or different forms as an avatara will come to protect the righteous people and to punish the unrighteous people that was the way in bhagavad-gita it is nicely explained now sri rama came for that ravana he practiced austerity spiritual austerity but at the time of the blessings he wanted all power so that he can rule the world he got the blessings if you practice austerity because of the karma of allah good karma that you are doing good thought you are thinking you are controlling your sense organs you will surely get the power but if you misuse the divine power naturally the god will punish you so this is the main teaching of the ramayana though the ravana himself was a great devotee of shiva and he used to worship shiva he used to practice spiritual austerity he got all the blessings and the power from the lord siva even then he was punished because he misused that power and he was torturing people so even if we are getting the blessings of god if we are not properly utilizing that power the one day the god will punish us this is the main teaching then when the he saw the lakshmana he cried out oh lakshmana what a great mistake you have done now he has come in the form of a human so he is behaving just like a human he knew that this is the time the moment he saw the golden deer he knew this is my time for my mission has come and that is why when the sheather told i like to get that deer he chased the deer and he could kill right from there but he came out so lakshmana came out now the rama who the god himself in the form of a human being started behaving like just like ordinary human being and he was crying o lakshmana what will happen to sita both the brothers came running back and they saw it is true shita was nowhere now there is a beautiful description in the ramayana the rama he became so sad that almost he lost his consciousness he was going and talking with the trees he was going and talking with the flowers he was going and talking asking the water the field each and every one have you seen shita shita used to come to you she tends to pluck flowers from here sheeta is to come and collect water from here have you seen shita there was no one around but the rama he was talking with the nature he was talking with the birds he was talking with the other things the lakshmana got concerned what has happened to sri rama and as a brother he told the rama you should not be so upset someday we'll surely find her now let us compose yourself and let us go out to search for the sita so both the brothers then took all their things and started their journey to find the sita when they were going on they suddenly saw that huge bird and from the distance they couldn't understand whether it was that bird jotaro you must have remembered all of us because we have already discussed about the bird the powerful bird jotaro so he was lying over there his about the wings were slain and he was wounded he was lying over there from the distance rama and lakshmana couldn't understand they were thinking it must be that raksha rakshasa the huge body has killed and eaten the flesh of sita so rama told come let us kill this the rakshasa the when they came close they saw it was the jatayu then the jatayu told the oh my children i am so sorry i couldn't protect the mother's sita so it was because of me although i tried my best to protect it is the ravana abducted the sita and took her to the he flew to the south the rabbana was having the one type of vehicle we can say that it is to fly now people may think oh these are all imagination now argument is the one type of machine was there it's like the helicopter now it is modern helicopter and it could come down on anything or any place land on any place and then flew from there fly from there it it was easy for them the only one was there in those days it was not with the rama even rama's father was a very bi huge the kingdom king but they were not also having this this rata ratham is the chariot that is to fly so that was only with the kubera and kubira was the brother of rabana so he said see he is the brother of ravana and rabana is the son of vishastraba vishya shrava son is the rabana and his brother is kubira this bird was giving the all information before the death he fought you know when i saw i heard i was actually sleeping suddenly i heard the scream of that sita then i came and saw the ravana he's using the the all the air and was very with a speed way going away i chased him and fought with him but i have become very old so obviously it was not possible for me to fight with the ravana but i have endured him i broke his bow and arrow and they really saw the golden bow and arrow left over there broken so obviously a king a rich man's bow and arrow it must be otherwise how it can be made of gold so they trusted the bird and the slowly the bird giving all the information and he said in a very wonderful way to rama don't lament you will get back your wife because the particular moment ravana abducted the sita that particular moment is known as binder the bingham moment is such a that astrologers they can say that particular moment whatever happens it may be bad maybe lost some people losing something always they get back so we can understand even that person was knowing the astrology the astrology is also a science and if one can properly calculate they can also say there is very difficult calculation though so he knew that and he said to rama that particular moment the rabbana was doing the this type of heinous work it was the that moment was binda and naturally anything that happens people lose anything and lost something they always get back o rama calculating on that i can say you will get back your wife so then he said you better go and search towards the south so they started proceeding towards the south when they were going inside then suddenly they heard a terrible voice and when they searched they found a very peculiar personality his face was on his belly and his hands were very long he can't move but stretching his two hands he can catch the birds or the animals and can eat them but when eating it is not the face on the shoulder it is the face on the belly if the mouth was on the bailey very peculiar looking when this that particular rakshasa again it has been termed as the rakshasa the when the rama and lakshmana saw he also tried to without knowing who they are he tried to catch them the both the brothers they cut uh the both the hands now that person was unable to do anything so they went close then he asked who are you when the rama and lakshmana disclosed that we are the children of the sharatha then he started praising them and he said i am waiting for you to come over here. now i did a mystic so the god gave me the curse i was eating everything and naturally i did some of the mistakes and the god gave me the punishment and i got my head on the face on my belly and only for the survival they gave me the long hands but said when the rama and his brother lakshmana will come and when they will cut your hands and you will die then you can go back to your their own abode i never even wanted to become rakshasa i have become rakshasa because of my bad karmapala so it is good that you have come as per the all that god said so i am going to be liberated but why you are here when he asks that the rama and lakshmana are told the reason that they are searching sita who has been abducted by the rabana this person told that i am the son of the new so i am that danu that you can know me that people they know me in that this name and i tell you that you will get back your wife if you go and develop a friendship with some of the very powerful kings who are now in trouble so make friendship develop friendship with that particular king and he is the king of the monkeys now something has happened and he is now in exile he is hiding he needs some friends and if you offer your friendship to him in return he will get back all his the power as a king and will help you so go through this way and you will meet some monkeys over there so they started their journey and they were going on in the meantime when the sita sita was going on crying and cursing the rabana as naturally and then suddenly she noticed when they were flying past which she noticed that some of the monkeys they are sitting in on the top of a hill and they were looking up to the ravanas that the craft flying trapped and they knew as if ravana so didn't do anything they were simply observing the shita quickly took out some of his uh some of our the jewelleries and threw it down thinking if the rama and lakshmana coming to that way then these people can show all those to them maybe they will recognize this belong to shita and they will know in which direction the rabbana has taken her friends in our next month the class we will continue from here the rama is coming and he will be meeting hanumana this is a beautiful the description when the rama and the hanumana are meeting together the lord and the servant and from there the main ramayana will begin so let us conclude over here by saying shanti three times o mushanti [Music] shaan [Music] that's it
