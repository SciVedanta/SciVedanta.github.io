[Ramayana 007 : Confusion in Ayodhya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsK1OHgVPoE)

who is also the embodiment of sri ramachandra so many of you know it and you can do along with me stop [Music] i saluted bhagavan's ramakrishna who has come to establish the dharma and bhagavan srirama krishna himself said he who was rama has become sri ramakrishna now when this when we find that the sri ramakrishna he is the embodiment of rama and he has come to establish the dharma righteousness and now we will study as we are continuing every month and the second thursday mostly the ramayana and what sri rama chandra is doing now on the fifth night rama shita and lakshmana slipped under a tree we know the fifth night last time we discussed about that they entered into the jungle and then ultimately they reached to a place where there was nothing and on the hilltop under a big tree three of them they slept that was the first time without any room these two the brothers rama and lakshmana and the sita the beautiful queen and the princes and they were sleeping under the tree but sheeta was very happy that we learned from her as the wife always with the husband and dedicating her everything with the husband and wherever the husband she is happy we see the same thing with maha sharadamani devi once so happened when bhagavan sriram krishna went to calcutta for his treatment and he was staying in shampoo bhati and mother was staying in dakshinesha someone commented you know in the society people are always there to comment without knowing anything and they commented the mother it may be that takur is not liking you anymore so he has left you over here and he has shifted to calcutta mother was taken aback she never thought in that way she was waiting the takur will be all right and he will come back that day mother went all the way to bhagavan's ramakrishna and she was completely new and even then somehow he reached over there takur was taken aback how come that you were here then mother told that is it you are not liking me and you left me like that sudama krishna became very angry who said this and that is the way the relation of the husband and the wife the wife has complete faith in the husband and husband is also having the complete faith in the wife so this is the in samsara so they have come to establish the religion and majority of the people who are living in the household they should understand they should know how the relation it should be of the husband and the wife this we see here also we find the rama and the shita rama with the shita is always there to protect the and shita is comfortable with sri ramachandra though they wearing so much of comfort in the palace now under the tree same comfort so this is the teaching that we should learn wherever we are it doesn't matter whether in luxury or in little difficult place if we are having the same mind we are happy so they spend that night next morning they reached the confluence of ganga and jamuna which is now the prayag that confluence by evening they reached the hermitage of saint bharadwaj who allotted a cottage for them there's a beautiful the description is also there they are going first is the ramachandra then then the sita and als afterwards the lakshmana they are going and they don't know anything of that place but they heard about it from the different rishis and also slowly slowly they were learning how to find out the the path how to understand the way so the when they heard that the river is flowing they always wanted to go near the river and follow the the course of the river so this is the way they were going they came to the confluence and from there from one point they they saw the smoke is coming out so this is also a picture of diday in society in india the kings used to live in the cities and other people were also nearby the cultivation was the main thing and raising the horses of the cows and the animals and that was the main the economy but there were the great people the rishis wished to live inside the jungle and inside the jungle how this to live they listed with the help of the king at the same time these two protect the jungle so in the inside the jungle they used to leave the rishis and the students used to go to them to learn that that was the formative time because in the veda we know they already discovered the truth the brahman but very few people they know about that and they were not capable to understand that subtlety of the brahman the brahman all pervading consciousness and all that they were not knowing so that is a very beginning period of the human society we can say but the great rishis were there who discovered it now they were researching how to develop the human society and the balance should be maintained so we always find in rama and almost in every page and if you read the original ramayana and the main translation of the the palmiki ramayana you will find the pictures of the this growth is there all the time the learned people is to advise the kings and at the same time keeping a balance between the king the ruler and the ordinary people as if we can say nowadays we have the judiciary department so the ruler is there administrator is there ordinary people is there in between there's the judiciary and the judiciary they always keep the balance if any problem is there between an ordinary person and the king he goes to the judiciary and complain and the judiciary they will judge same way the rishis used to do this to train the people and training they are giving the problem is we don't have the complete record of that mostly it has gone in the name of the religion instead if they had pointed out a group of students who came over there a general training was there how to live with the in the family how to live in the society it was there at the same time the special training courses how to develop the agriculture and the animal husbandry and this all sorts of things were there after learning the students is to go back to the society and like nowadays also the students go to different educational institutions then they come back and join in the main society force the same way but main trustworth on the religion on the morality on the ethics and also again and again is to teach that you should always be with the truth so that was the training it was to go on two groups were there another group of people who were also there but at the same time they were little the ruffian types rough types so they called them the the under the asuras like that now we will follow the sri ramachandra sri ramachandra is entering he went and from the distance he found the smoke is coming out and the moment the smoke means there must be human being because they that means fire is there and when the fire is there must be human being is there so ram told lakshmana let us go to that direction they came over there and then they found that the hermitage of saint bharadwaja you know that many of the hindus are having their gotra gotra means the the it's called we can call it um that the family tradition is the gotra and that is called bharadwaj gotra is a very famous and this bharadwaja gotra means the teaching that the varudhwaj gave to his students so that is called that the culture they learned the lifestyle they learned from the bharadwaja so that is called bharadwaj rama went to him bharat dwaja and introduced i am the son of the king dasharata and this is my brother the another son of king dasharatha he is lakshmana and this is my wife sheeta she is the daughter of the janaka janaka was a great king see they all knew bharadwaja said o rama we all know about you and i know though you have not done anything wrong but they have banished you from there see how what i like to point out over here was inside the jungle rama is walking for five days to reach him that means it was very far from their place ayodha but he knew what has happened in ajada how it was possible that means people used to move and the news is to go there where the system was there so bharadwajar told i know and don't worry about it we all know about all this thing now they allotted a cottage to sri ramachandra rama and shita they entered into the cottage and shita was as usual very happy so humble but all system was there so they gave the food and the clothings and they lived over there shita was very happy thinking that you can live over here she was thinking that is better to live in the astra all people are there the yakyas are going on the study is there so she was thinking in that way bharata asked him to go to chitrakuta because ramu never wanted to stay over there why because the some people used to live nearby and rama was very intelligent the moment he came to know the bharatas knew about him that means people are connected with the ayodhya and all information from ajuddha is coming here and obviously i am here the information about the ramachandra staying with the bharathwaja will also reach back to ayodha so he told sir you are so kind you are offering me the to stay over here but thank you i like to go somewhere else oh venerable sir but i like to go to a place where there is no one will who will know me the ramachandra wants to go some place where nobody will know him as the prince of ayota in our tradition it says swami vivekananda also mentioned if you like to develop your spiritual life you should go to a place where no one knows you otherwise if you go then oh he is the son of a great king so obviously whether you have the quality or not because of your father you will get lot of respect and all other help but a spiritual life should be completely all alone without the introduction of anyone so you can so people will insult you people will behave just in normal way and you have to adjust with them and slowly slowly the your ego will be eradicated otherwise oh they don't know i am the rama and i am powerful i am this i am that so if the ego is nurtured it is very difficult to realize god sri rama chandras only object is atma darshan to realize that atman to have the knowledge of the atman and he wants to utilize these 14 years of exile for developing the spiritual life and that is the reason he wants to go to a secluded place a place where people will not know him so that is his idea he he was requesting bharadwaja please tell me some place where i can live all alone and people won't uh know me said that you better go to chitrakuta we all know chitrakuta is a very famous place nowadays in india the chitrakuta and he said in details how to go there because muni he said i have visited that place many a time i am not going in details and he told what you will find what is there etc etc say two three things whenever this the monks they go uh to inside the forest to stay or alone the first thing is it should be secured not infested by the animals like the tiger and all that so it should be free from that first second there should be nearby a river so that you can utilize the water and you can drink the water etc and third is at least a little distance there should be some people from where you can get the food or a lot of fruit trees the fruit that you can eat so that is the way the bharadwaja was calculating so we can understand how the spiritual life in india was growing up the rishi is guiding he understood the ramachandra is is interested to grow his spiritual life so he told you better go to chitrakuta and to go over there you have to prepare a raft and then you can cross the swift moving river the raft means it is not a boat is some of the woods you have to tie together lakshmana was very perfect in all those so how they were trained though they were prims nowadays a rich man's son knows nothing if you ask any particularly in indian situation and the rich man's son he only knows how to eat and how to spend the father's money but mostly they don't understand that is the reason in olden days they used to send them to guru griya and guru kriya means you have to learn everything how you have to survive in the jungle how the poor people they survive they help they know how what to do in any situation they can help themselves so these are the things that we miss while studying the ramayana we study the story but in between all those in between the lines the beautiful the picture of the society we miss rama and lakshmana they went to the river and as the rishi told you have to prepare a raft and you have to cross the river and when you are crossing the river you are going to the other bank you have to calculate if the river is flowing in this way and it has this type of force if i am floating from here and where i will reach on the other shore that means you should have that the knowledge of navigation also boat rowing also so these are the things these two brothers they were having everything and and even at that time lakshmana prepared a beautiful seat covered that with the cloth and asked the sheather to seat on that because as the lakshmana's mother told you should consider shita as your own mother and lakshmina all through was preparing in this way constantly giving comfort to the mother sita the sita went and sat on that and she was comfortable because the wrapped means it will be the water will come up it's not the boat obviously the little and then in that rough river so he should she should feel comfortable rama stood behind holding that chair uh where the sita was sitting support and lakshmana was rowing and they crossed the river after receiving the river this bharadwajar told after on the other bank when you reach you will find the leaps of the trees are of this color there you should go the different type of see this is the the training that they went to that and they found that type of leaves of the trees most of the trees are leaves were like that so they stopped over there and they reached the shore and wayne and bharadwaja told there you will find a huge huge banyan tree and this banyan tree is very old under the banyan trees so many divine souls the holy souls they have meditated so if you go you must bow down to that a tree now i must inform you tell you that while crossing the river every river shita was praying to the river and she was telling that o river please protect us so this is the tradition whenever we go we should have to pray to the nature and tell nature or please protect us when i was in naratam nagar i was not knowing this i read it afterwards but there was a the reaver and that name is buried in hindi buri means bad so that buried the digging river but buried so that buddhi sometimes suddenly there will be the flash flood will be there and it's so dangerous almost every year people will die i used to pray to that river every day morning after the morning prayer as to go and the bank of the river has to pray to the river oh mother river please protect us we stay here to give education to the children so don't do any harm to us sometimes the tribal children they go near to the river they will be touching the water or something bathing secretly i used to pray to the mother please don't do any harm to them and i can say the prayer was answered by this way i can tell you not a single incident wrong incident bad incident happened till my state 12 years has stayed there nothing happened the river was always good so if we pray to the nature that also respond so it was praying to the river and also the tree when they reached to the tree ram lakshman and shita they went round this tree and bowed down to the tree the banyan tree and lakshmana built a cottage with the strong wood and shita was very happy the next morning they walked some distance and reached the chitrakuta mountain there they went to the hermitage of baal miki see first is bharadwaja and the other bank of the river it was balmiki and we know the balmiki is the writer of the ramayana the lord the rishi balmiki and we can understand it was so comfortable comfortable in the sense that good people are there they never talk about the worldly things so that is the way the rama's are going so if you are among the people who are constantly talking about the walletings and talking about the politics talking about the cheating others and all this it is a really really painful but those who really love god and also like to develop their spirituality if they are living with the company of the good people they feel happy the rama and lakshmana they walked through the riverbed and they reached to the balmiki's cottage and balmiki told you can stay over here but the difference is when there they were in the bharadwaja munis cottage there were many empty cottages already built that means bharadwaj used to receive the guest but in balmiki only a few people were staying over there and balmiki was not having any extra separate cottage for the guest so lakshmana immediately lakshmana constructed the raft lakshmana calculated from where they will float on the river and how they will cross and because they are going though in favor of the uh the the river and they have to reach the other shore lakshmana did it and then now we find after reaching the hermitage of valmiki the lakshmana is constructing a cottage here the description is lakshmana built it with strong wood because lakshmi was thinking we are going to stay here for long so he instead of the ordinary wood he cut down the big strong woods and chiseled them and then brought it and constructed maybe it is not written maybe that other people who were there leaving the other students of the valmiki's they were helping him so that was the system so they built that beautiful cottage and very spacious cottage because lakshmana always wanted to give comfort to the mother sita so it's a big spacious cottage and lakshmana made the apartment for the rama and sita and lakshmana separately starved for him so they were very comfortable shita entered and was very happy and told rama can you stay here for all these 14 years instead of going round here and there but the rama knew the purpose of his exile we will come to that afterwards rama was the god himself the avatara so obviously he has come to establish the dharma the righteousness he knew his mission and but he was behaving just like the ordinary human being he told why not we can be here comfortable let us see as per the situation in the ayat this is the picture that we find in the ramachandra he entered into the jungle and he was getting the company of the holy people the great rishis like bharadwaja valmiki rama was very happy though the people who banished him particularly that koike she was thinking rama will suffer but instead rama was very happy and what happened to kiki what happened to ayodhya what was their condition it was in a crows the ayodhya was a completely coward king passed away and who will take the decision you know it is the in the this type of kingdom where the king is the main person when the king is not there is a thorough confusion what will happen i don't know whether you have heard the word it's called chatra bhanga the chatra bhanga means chatra means umbrella bhanga means breaking when the indian kings used to go to war they mainly used to see it on on the horse or on the elephant and on the top of them covering them that were there was an umbrella if you go to south india even in the kerala and madras and tamil nadu so you will find even nowadays when they're having the processions they will be having the god or goddess or the statue of the god or some saint sitting on the top of the elephant particularly in kerala elephant is a must and they'll be holding an umbrella nicely decorated umbrella on the head of the top of that so that was the system the indian kings used to follow and when they used to go to the war and the king will be in distance observing how the things are going on the moving then suddenly if somehow that is broken the umbrella is broken the soldiers who is to fight for the king they will leave that battlefield so chatra bhanga the chatra bhangam is breaking chatra the umbrella and that means nowadays the synonyms of the chatrabanga means scattering immediately they will so that was the one weakness for our kings and when the people they came from outside and attacking the indian kingdoms they understood this weakness and their target used to be to break that umbrella and the moment the umbrella is broken that means king is not there the king is leaving perhaps perhaps he has fallen from the horseback or the elephant back but king was leaving but the people from the distance did couldn't see the king as because the umbrella was broken they will all run away though it was in their favor they could win the war but most of the time they used to lose it that was the weakness and the foreigners they understood it here we find when the king is not there that the shraddha was not there everybody is in confusion now we see the another picture one after another the great sages they started coming and making the assembly over there the sharatha was a great king naturally all these great sages they were connected with the surat these sages the great saints like mark india we know the name the mark india those who study the hindu scripture they know the mark india this mark india bahamuddeva another great saint then kashapa kashiva was the great muni and gotama jabali and many others they assembled in the royal court and discussed with the ministers friends from here we find a beautiful picture of the then society now what will happen suppose someone has died you know that in the great beaten they have a slogan they always say like this king is dead long leave the king what that means the moment the king passed away immediately he will declare another one as a king so that is the continuation of otherwise there will be confusion immediately the enemies will start thinking oh if the king is not there let us go and attack and let us do something harm to for to them and many other people they will start in their own way because king is the administrator because of the fear of the king everything is in the society goes all right here when the dasharata passed away immediately these great sages the saints they all assembled where in the quote king's quote they came and they also called the ministers and all of them they sat together and they decided the what to do now they chose as because the family guru was bashista the all the rishis the neighbors said i will tell i will do no they decided what to do then the spear headed and they put all responsibility to the bashist bushish was also a great rishi friends see if we read this we notice that there was no jealousy no grabbing of power can you imagine the all over the great kingdom of dasharata ajada was only the capital these rishis they could take the power no they they never did that they rather after discussing what is good the pros and cons then they gave it the responsibility was given to bashishta as because bashishta was the guru of the ragu family that now you have to take the lead ministers were there the ministers were political people the obviously who will do what now the rishi is coming in his place and giving the dictation that this is the tradition of the indian administration the rishis are always there but they will only advise and at a time like this when the king is dead and the whole country is in confusion then they are coming taking the proper decision without any emotion without any selfish motive for the benefit of the people of the country they are taking the decision and that they are instructing when the decision is over they leave that place the sannyasins the rishis the holy people they never ever they entered into politics this we should understand this you should remember in hinduism advices of the holy souls are there for the administrators but the holy souls never ever entered into the direct politics now the bashist took the lead and he said to the assembly he said king dasharata is dead now he is analyzing the situation king dasharata is date lakshmana rama lakshmana and sita they are in exile they are not here the rama and lakshmana are mainly their two brothers had they been here it would have been different but the because of the rama's exactly this is the problem has come the sharatha could not bear it and he was constantly thinking that because of me sri rama has gone into exile then he is telling the rama and lakshmana they are not here muruba bharatha bharat and satrukna they have gone to their maternal uncle's house at rajagriha it is particularly bharatha's maternal house uncle's house it's not satrugnas but even then this to consider their brothers from different mothers though but it is their maternal uncle's house so two brothers are there now what to do in a kingless country in a kingless country no one is safe in two three pages our bashist muni he is going on giving the accounts what happened when a king is not there what happened when the administration is not there in a society so one must be very very careful once the administration is broken is very difficult to put into that set the whole thing once again is really very difficult even in the modern society we can see whenever there is no administration there is no ruler there is someone who can who can give the punishment and the reward majority of the time the hooligans the bad people though they will come and because of their muscle power they will try to capture the society and if they start leading the society there will be complete suffering for each and everyone to set it back to normal life is really very difficult so without any delay the the rishi is telling bashist muni is telling it's like a river without water and i just said i am not going to give the whole the statement that the rishi said now he is asking the take the fast moving strong horses and reached rajagriha look at it fast moving strong horses and who will go he is choosing the people who will go though there is no description about this but they are not ordinary people anyone cannot go because this is a very emergency a very important thing what these people who are going to tell the bharata to come back should not disclose anything the king is dead oh bharata we have come to inform you if you say like that immediately the other countries other states may think or this is the right time we should capture so they immediately they may send their soldiers to capture some part of the country so the secrecy is one of the most important thing in the administration so who can keep the secrecy so there is the main thing you know that story many of you must have heard the impartian i think i have forgotten in the parshaya one person they're saying the three dolls and asked the king solomon yeah maybe the solomon story there is a king in persia he was a very wise person so the another king sent him three dolls just same looking made up with the same metal and told o king can you please judge which is the best one the king he's having some of the ministers they're very intelligent people so one was give the he thought that he would be able to do many tried but the most intelligent one told the king give it to me let me try then he tried in this way he put a thin wear through the mouth of one of the doll and that wear came out from one of the ear then it will know whatever he hear it goes from the from the ear he put and it came out from the mouth that where no whatever this person here he goes and speaking so he is not good for the administration he is there okay the second one the moment they put the year that uh where from one year it came out from the end of the year oh no he listens and forgets he cannot remember the instructions so it is also not good and the third one when he put that where into the ear of the doll it never came out then this is the one and good for the administration and that means we can see we can hear but we should not disclose that is the main thing the good people in administration means they should have these qualities when the kings are choosing here we find he is choosing the three person the siddharth bijaya and these are the three people they took the fast moving horses and took the shortest route through the jungle and reached rajagria in one day and when they were sending look at it though he was a rishi but he was having all the knowledges with these three people the messengers he gave lord a beautiful gift from one king anyone going to another king they should take the gift and that is the custom so the beautiful things they took and then they gave it to and they met the the king kekaya the kikaya's daughter is koike the name came from his father kikaya to this father and also his brother judas they met them and gave the all the gift and they told we have come to meet our prince with we with you here and that is the bharata and satra they made the bharata and they told the bharata was wondering how come you were here he knew them that they told you have to come back and we don't know anything else because the information that we are supposed to give you is this that you must come back with us and today itself we should start the bharata was asking question about the father how is the health of the father he was naturally worried second he asked how is rama is he all right and third he asked about the mothers and last only he asked about his own mother because he knew the characteristics of his own mother a little greedy like that so she he asked about her at the last then gave all the answers in positive yes they are good they're good they're good then bharata was was ready to come back but his maternal uncle he was also a big king so he told no no you cannot go back like this when after staying with us you are going back we should give also the gift to you and what type of gift now the king kekaya presented bharata excellent elephants and blankets deerskins domesticated dogs big and strong like the tigers he also gave him 2 000 beads of gold and sixteen thousand sixteen hundred horses and the mules very sweep moving mules and also a number of servants for bharata's return so this is the wealth the indian kings used to have and they were not the emperors they were having only a portion in the india you can imagine though they say the greater india was up to the afghanistan nowadays and whatever but this people's kingdom was not that big even then they were having so much of rich so we can imagine the richness of india and that is the reason afterwards in the 11th 12th century the people started to plunder india because it was so much of wealth everywhere and people used to donate the gold and other jewelries to the temples the temples were very rich so this is the way but whatever i just thought i should tell what are the gifts the maternal uncle gave to and the now the bharata is coming back after the journey after seven nights bharata arrived in front of the ayotta now these three messengers they reached that we can imagine they were traveling through the shortest route and they were also changing the horses that was the system in those days they'll be running for some hours and when the horses are tired there will be horse change places and naturally kings people that they were always getting the best horses ready again they will move but the people were so hardy and so obedient they went they informed and then they're coming back with the and why it took seven days and nights for the bharata to reach back because he was coming with so many things the elephants that naturally we can imagine it was a huge procession as if a king is moving so all the so many people are moving for their food also so he was slow he came to ayata and when he entered into ayada bharata failed something wrong something is not normal because ayuda all people are always happy and all the naturally in those days they'll be having the songs the dramas the dances the marketplace are full of people and business people were there but he felt things are not like that even the ordinary people never greeted him why because they were not at all happy with the bharata they knew his mother is the cause of sri ramachandra's banishment that's why the people were angry with bharata they thought is because of the bharata rama had to go away rama was so popular so people used to love him but why they used to love ramachandra because he was god himself the god is love and the when the god takes the human form other human being cannot but loved that person sudama krishna was loved by each and everyone those who have read the biography of suramar krishna when he was a young boy in that village everyone is to like him love him and sometimes there is to come to the house after the whole day's trialing after the whole day's work the mainly the ladies used to come to his mother as to say we like to see gadai without seeing him we don't feel the joy so before returning back to our cottages our homes we like to see gaday so this is the proof of god the god is joy anand the please and god is love if anyone is trying to realize god how people will understand he will develop love love for each and everyone without any discrimination without any judgment oh these people speak in my tongue so i should love them or they belong to my family so i should love them never like that the love for each and everyone because that is divine love is divine so people they used to love sri ramachandra so bharath came and bharat came to because the three queens were having three different palaces straight went to their own palace his own palace where the key was there and when bharat went over there kriki was so happy seeing him oh my son you have returned back everything is now ready for you she was thinking bharat will appreciate your father breathed his last rama and lakshmana also and also sita they have also gone away from here and now there is no one on your be becoming a king the quickest was thinking the varata will be happy the moment bharat first asked about the father and when he heard the father has passed away and the cause of his passing away because the rama left the palace immediately fainted rabarat was to love rama so much and afterwards friends we will see how the bharata that is the characteristics of the indian rulers the neighbor killed their brothers or the father to just to grab the throne never so that was the indian culture indian tradition when you talk about the the why swami vivekananda said that this is a punjab humi because the tradition when we read when we learn when we hear is really excellent the human and the god there is no much difference because the god love and human also loved so much god is unselfish human also grew to that stage of unselfishness and they were so just and what is religion then this is religion though there are temptations but to control those temptations and to move to on the path of the righteousness that is religion thank you friend the again in the next month we will meet and we will discuss about as we are following sri ramachandra we will be discussing the the different sometimes the society and sometimes what is true religion is because sri rama chandra neighbors said that you should meditate you should take the name of god as the krishna did no he only lived his life and you have to learn the religion righteousness from the life of sri ramachandra [Music] that's it thank you very much
